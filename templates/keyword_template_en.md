## Evaluation Rules
1. **Inclusion condition**: At least one EXACT keyword must be found in ALL 3 categories
2. **Exclusion condition**: If ANY category has NO exact keyword matches, exclude the paper immediately
3. **Strict matching**: 
   - Case-insensitive matching allowed
   - But must be EXACT word/phrase matches from the list
   - Do NOT accept: similar terms, synonyms, abbreviations, or related concepts
4. **Wildcard handling**: 
   - * means any characters can follow
   - "behavio*" matches "behavioral", "behavioural", "behavior", "behaviour"
   - "activity schedule*" matches "activity scheduling", "activity schedules", etc.
5. **Exact citation**: The highlight field must include exact sentences from the original text

**STRICT EXAMPLES**:
- ✅ ACCEPT: "depression", "mobile app", "behavioral activation"
- ❌ REJECT: "depressed mood", "mobile device", "activity therapy"
- ❌ REJECT: "anxiety", "tablet", "cognitive therapy"

## Analysis Process
1. **Step 1**: Carefully read the Title and Abstract
2. **Step 2**: Search for ONLY the exact keywords listed in each category
3. **Step 3**: For each found keyword, verify it matches EXACTLY (case-insensitive)
4. **Step 4**: Count matches per category:
   - Category 1 (Depression): How many exact matches?
   - Category 2 (Mobile/Digital): How many exact matches?
   - Category 3 (Behavioral): How many exact matches?
5. **Step 5**: Apply decision rule:
   - If ALL 3 categories have at least 1 exact match → "include"
   - If ANY category has 0 exact matches → "exclude"
6. **Step 6**: Quote the exact sentences containing the found keywords for each category:
   - depression_highlight: Sentences containing depression keywords
   - mobile_highlight: Sentences containing mobile/digital keywords  
   - behavioral_highlight: Sentences containing behavioral keywords
7. **Step 7**: Provide justification in Korean

**REMEMBER**: You are looking for EXACT keyword matches only. Do NOT be creative or interpretive. Be strict and literal.
