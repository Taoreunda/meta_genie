BACKGROUND: College students are increasingly reporting common mental health 
problems, such as depression and anxiety, and they frequently encounter barriers 
to seeking traditional mental health treatments. Digital mental health 
interventions, such as those delivered via the Web and apps, offer the potential 
to improve access to mental health treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the literature on digital mental health 
interventions focused on depression, anxiety, and enhancement of psychological 
well-being among samples of college students to identify the effectiveness, 
usability, acceptability, uptake, and adoption of such programs.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration number 
CRD42018092800), and the search strategy was conducted by a medical research 
librarian in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), 
PsycINFO (EbscoHost), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), and Web of Science (Thomson 
Reuters) from the date of inception to April 2019. Data were synthesized using a 
systematic narrative synthesis framework, and formal quality assessments were 
conducted to address the risk of bias.
RESULTS: A total of 89 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of 
interventions (71/89, 80%) were delivered via a website, and the most common 
intervention was internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (28, 31%). Many 
programs (33, 37%) featured human support in the form of coaching. The majority 
of programs were either effective (42, 47%) or partially effective (30, 34%) in 
producing beneficial changes in the main psychological outcome variables. 
Approximately half of the studies (45, 51%) did not present any usability or 
acceptability outcomes, and few studies (4, 4%) examined a broad implementation 
of digital mental health interventions on college campuses. Quality assessments 
revealed a moderate-to-severe risk of bias in many of the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that digital mental health interventions can be 
effective for improving depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being among 
college students, but more rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the 
effective elements of these interventions. Continued research on improving the 
user experience of, and thus user engagement with, these programs appears vital 
for the sustainable implementation of digital mental health interventions on 
college campuses.

BACKGROUND: Internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) is a viable delivery 
format of CBT for depression. However, iCBT programmes include training in a 
wide array of cognitive and behavioural skills via different delivery methods, 
and it remains unclear which of these components are more efficacious and for 
whom.
METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual participant data component 
network meta-analysis (cNMA) of iCBT trials for depression. We searched PubMed, 
PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) published from database inception to Jan 1, 2019, that compared any form 
of iCBT against another or a control condition in the acute treatment of adults 
(aged ≥18 years) with depression. Studies with inpatients or patients with 
bipolar depression were excluded. We sought individual participant data from the 
original authors. When these data were unavailable, we used aggregate data. Two 
independent researchers identified the included components. The primary outcome 
was depression severity, expressed as incremental mean difference (iMD) in the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores when a component is added to a 
treatment. We developed a web app that estimates relative efficacies between any 
two combinations of components, given baseline patient characteristics. This 
study is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018104683.
FINDINGS: We identified 76 RCTs, including 48 trials contributing individual 
participant data (11 704 participants) and 28 trials with aggregate data (6474 
participants). The participants' weighted mean age was 42·0 years and 12 406 
(71%) of 17 521 reported were women. There was suggestive evidence that 
behavioural activation might be beneficial (iMD -1·83 [95% credible interval 
(CrI) -2·90 to -0·80]) and that relaxation might be harmful (1·20 [95% CrI 0·17 
to 2·27]). Baseline severity emerged as the strongest prognostic factor for 
endpoint depression. Combining human and automated encouragement reduced 
dropouts from treatment (incremental odds ratio, 0·32 [95% CrI 0·13 to 0·93]). 
The risk of bias was low for the randomisation process, missing outcome data, or 
selection of reported results in most of the included studies, uncertain for 
deviation from intended interventions, and high for measurement of outcomes. 
There was moderate to high heterogeneity among the studies and their components.
INTERPRETATION: The individual patient data cNMA revealed potentially helpful, 
less helpful, or harmful components and delivery formats for iCBT packages. iCBT 
packages aiming to be effective and efficient might choose to include beneficial 
components and exclude ones that are potentially detrimental. Our web app can 
facilitate shared decision making by therapist and patient in choosing their 
preferred iCBT package.

BACKGROUND: The Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) provides a reliable 
method to assess the quality of mobile health (mHealth) apps. However, training 
and expertise in mHealth and the relevant health field is required to administer 
it.
OBJECTIVE: This study describes the development and reliability testing of an 
end-user version of the MARS (uMARS).
METHODS: The MARS was simplified and piloted with 13 young people to create the 
uMARS. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the uMARS was 
then examined in a second sample of 164 young people participating in a 
randomized controlled trial of a mHealth app. App ratings were collected using 
the uMARS at 1-, 3,- and 6-month follow up.
RESULTS: The uMARS had excellent internal consistency (alpha = .90), with high 
individual alphas for all subscales. The total score and subscales had good 
test-retest reliability over both 1-2 months and 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The uMARS is a simple tool that can be reliably used by end-users 
to assess the quality of mHealth apps.

BACKGROUND: Adolescent health promotion is important in preventing risk 
behaviors and improving mental health. Health promotion during adolescence has 
been shown to contribute to the prevention of late onset of the mental health 
disease. However, scalable interventions have not been established yet.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to test the efficacy of two adolescent health 
promotion interventions: a well-care visit (WCV) with a risk assessment 
interview and counseling and self-monitoring with a smartphone cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) app. Our hypothesis was that participants who had 
received both WCV and the CBT app would have better outcomes than those who had 
received only WCV or those who had not received any intervention. We conducted a 
prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Participants were 217 adolescents aged 13-18 years. They were randomly 
divided into two intervention groups (WCV group and WCV with CBT app group) and 
a nonintervention group. WCV comprised a standardized physical examination along 
with a structured interview and counseling for youth risk assessment, which was 
designed with reference to the Guideline for Health Supervision of Adolescents 
of Bright Futures. A smartphone-based CBT program was developed based on the CBT 
approach. The CBT app comprised a 1-week psychoeducation component and a 1-week 
self-monitoring component. During the CBT program, participants created several 
self-monitoring sheets based on the CBT model with five window panels: event, 
thoughts, feelings, body response, and actions. The primary outcome was the 
change in scores for depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in 
scores for self-esteem, quality of life, self-monitoring, and an adolescent 
health promotion scale. These outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 2, 
and 4 months after baseline. The exploratory outcome was the presence of 
suicidal ideation during the observation period. Intervention effects were 
estimated using mixed effect models.
RESULTS: In total, 94% (204/217) of the participants completed the 4-month 
evaluation. Both intervention groups showed a significant effect in the form of 
reduced scores for depressive symptoms at 1 month in high school students; 
however, these effects were not observed at 2 and 4 months. The intervention 
effect was significantly more predominant in those scoring above cutoff for 
depressive symptoms. There was significantly less suicidal ideation in the 
intervention groups. As for secondary outcomes, there was significant increase 
in health promotion scale scores at the 4-month follow-up among junior high 
school students in the WCV group. Moreover, the CBT app was significantly 
effective in terms of obtaining self-monitoring skills and reducing depressive 
symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although adolescent health promotion interventions may have 
short-term benefits, the frequency of WCV and further revision of the CBT app 
should be considered to evaluate long-term effectiveness.

IMPORTANCE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) reported a 
significant decline in their mental health. One potential health behavior 
intervention that has been shown to be effective for improving mental health is 
exercise, which may be facilitated by taking advantage of mobile application 
(app) technologies.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which a 12-week app-based exercise 
intervention can reduce depressive symptoms, burnout, and absenteeism in HCWs, 
compared with a wait list control condition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-group randomized clinical trial was 
conducted, with participants screened from April 6 to July 4, 2022. Participants 
were recruited from an urban health care organization in British Columbia, 
Canada. Participants completed measures before randomization and every 2 weeks 
thereafter.
INTERVENTIONS: Exercise condition participants were asked to complete 
four 20-minute sessions per week using a suite of body weight interval training, 
yoga, barre, and running apps. Wait-listed control participants received the 
apps at the end of the trial.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome consisted of the between-group 
difference in depressive symptoms measured with the 10-item Center for 
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes corresponded to 
3 subfacets of burnout (cynicism, emotional exhaustion, and professional 
efficacy) and absenteeism. Intention-to-treat analyses were completed with 
multilevel structural equation modeling, and Feingold effect sizes (ES) were 
estimated every 2 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 288 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.0 [10.8] years; 246 
[85.4%] women) were randomized to either exercise (n = 142) or wait list control 
(n = 146) conditions. Results revealed that ESs for depressive symptoms were in 
the small to medium range by trial's end (week 12, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.69 to 
-0.13]). Significant and consistent treatment effects were revealed for 2 facets 
of burnout, namely cynicism (week 12 ES, -0.33 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.13]) and 
emotional exhaustion (week 12 ES, -0.39 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.14]), as well as 
absenteeism (r = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.03-0.26]). Adherence to the 80 minutes per week 
of exercise decreased from 78 (54.9%) to 33 (23.2%) participants between weeks 2 
and 12.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although exercise was able to reduce depressive 
symptoms among HCWs, adherence was low toward the end of the trial. Optimizing 
adherence to exercise programming represents an important challenge to help 
maintain improvements in mental health among HCWs.

PURPOSE: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a common distressing condition. We 
investigated the efficacy of smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral 
activation applications in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: This was a decentralized randomized trial. Participants were 
disease-free breast cancer survivors age 20-49 years who were randomly assigned 
to the smartphone-based intervention or waitlist control. Both groups received 
treatment as usual. The control group could access the smartphone apps during 
weeks 8-24. The intervention comprised smartphone problem-solving therapy and 
behavioral activation apps. The primary end point was the Concerns About 
Recurrence Scale at week 8. Secondary outcomes included the Fear of Cancer 
Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34), and the 
Posttraumatic Growth Inventory at weeks 8 and 24 (trial registration: UMIN-CTR: 
UMIN000031140).
RESULTS: The intervention group included 223 participants, and the control group 
included 224 participants. Primary outcome data were obtained for 444 
participants, and 213 participants in the intervention arm completed the week 24 
assessment. The intervention group had statistically greater improvements than 
controls at week 8 on the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (difference -1.39; 95% 
CI, -1.93 to -0.85; P < .001), FCRI-SF (difference -1.65; 95% CI, -2.41 to 
-0.89; P < .001), HADS depression (difference -0.49; 95% CI, -0.98 to 0; P < 
.05), and SCNS-SF34 psychological domain (difference -1.49; 95% CI, -2.67 to 
-0.32; P < .05). These scores at week 24 were not statistically significant 
compared with week 8 although the HADS depression score at week 24 was 
significantly reduced (P = .03).
CONCLUSION: Novel smartphone psychotherapy offers a promising way to reduce FCR 
given the large number of survivors and a limited number of therapists to 
competently conduct psychotherapy.

IMPORTANCE: Depression is a leading contributor to disease burden globally. 
Digital mental health interventions can address the treatment gap in low- and 
middle-income countries, but the effectiveness in these countries is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a digital intervention in 
reducing depressive symptoms among people with diabetes and/or hypertension.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants with clinically significant 
depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score ≥10) who were 
being treated for hypertension and/or diabetes were enrolled in a cluster 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) at 20 sites in São Paulo, Brazil (N=880; from 
September 2016 to September 2017; final follow-up, April 2018), and in an 
individual-level RCT at 7 sites in Lima, Peru (N=432; from January 2017 to 
September 2017; final follow-up, March 2018).
INTERVENTIONS: An 18-session, low-intensity, digital intervention was delivered 
over 6 weeks via a provided smartphone, based on behavioral activation 
principles, and supported by nurse assistants (n = 440 participants in 10 
clusters in São Paulo; n = 217 participants in Lima) vs enhanced usual care 
(n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 215 participants in 
Lima).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 50% 
from baseline in PHQ-9 scores (range, 0-27; higher score indicates more severe 
depression) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included a reduction of at least 50% 
from baseline PHQ-9 scores at 6 months.
RESULTS: Among 880 patients cluster randomized in Brazil (mean age, 56.0 years; 
761 [86.5%] women) and 432 patients individually randomized in Peru (mean age, 
59.7 years; 352 [81.5%] women), 807 (91.7%) in Brazil and 426 (98.6%) in Peru 
completed at least 1 follow-up assessment. The proportion of participants in São 
Paulo with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 
40.7% (159/391 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 28.6% (114/399 
participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 12.1 percentage 
points [95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 
2.2]; P = .001). In Lima, the proportion of participants with a reduction in 
PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 52.7% (108/205 
participants) in the digital intervention group vs 34.1% (70/205 participants) 
in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 18.6 percentage points [95% CI, 
9.1 to 28.0]; adjusted OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2]; P < .001). At 6-month 
follow-up, differences across groups were no longer statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 2 RCTs of patients with hypertension or diabetes 
and depressive symptoms in Brazil and Peru, a digital intervention delivered 
over a 6-week period significantly improved depressive symptoms at 3 months when 
compared with enhanced usual care. However, the magnitude of the effect was 
small in the trial from Brazil and the effects were not sustained at 6 months.

A large proportion of women experience depression during the postpartum period. 
Few studies have investigated the use of mobile technology to prevent postpartum 
depression in women. This study investigated the preliminary effectiveness of 
the CareMom program, a new app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program, on 
reducing the depressive symptoms of mothers during the very early postpartum 
period via a pilot randomized controlled study. The participants were recruited 
during birth hospitalization (within 3 days after giving birth) and randomized 
to the waiting-list control and CareMom groups. Over the four-week intervention 
period, the CareMom group was required to complete 28 daily challenges via 
CareMom. The depressive (via EPDS) and anxiety (via GAD-7) levels of 
participants were measured at baseline and every 7 days postbaseline for 4 
weeks. A total of 112 eligible participants were randomly allocated to the two 
groups (CareMom: n = 57; control: n = 55). At week 4, the CareMom group achieved 
a significantly lower EPDS score than the control group at week 4 (p = 0.037). 
In addition, the EPDS (p < 0.001) scores of the CareMom group were significantly 
lower than the baseline values. However, the control group did not show any 
significant reduction in this measure. No significant reduction of GAD-7 scores 
was observed for CareMom and control groups at week 4. This study provides 
preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of CareMom in reducing depressive 
symptoms in the general postpartum population during the very early postpartum 
period.

BACKGROUND: Depression has a high prevalence among young adults, especially 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, mental health services remain scarce and 
underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology 
to provide fully automated interventions for depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the clinical effectiveness and 
nonclinical performance of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental 
health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: In a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial, participants 
manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a Chinese university were 
randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n=49), an e-book (n=49), or 
a general chatbot (Xiaoai; n=50) group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants 
received a 1-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of 
depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 
at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Both intention-to-treat and 
per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance models 
adjusting for baseline data. Controlled multiple imputation and δ-based 
sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes 
were the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance 
Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability Metric for User 
Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability 
Scale (AS).
RESULTS: Participants were on average 18.78 years old, and 37.2% (55/148) were 
female. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19). 
Intention-to-treat analysis revealed lower PHQ-9 scores among participants in 
the XiaoE group compared with participants in the e-book group and Xiaoai group 
at both T1 (F2,136=17.011; P<.001; d=0.51) and T2 (F2,136=5.477; P=.005; 
d=0.31). Better working alliance (WAQ; F2,145=3.407; P=.04) and acceptability 
(AS; F2,145=4.322; P=.02) were discovered with XiaoE, while no significant 
difference among arms was found for usability (UMUX-LITE; F2,145=0.968; P=.38).
CONCLUSIONS: A CBT-based chatbot is a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic 
approach that allows easy accessibility and self-guided mental health assistance 
for young adults with depressive symptoms. A systematic evaluation of 
nonclinical metrics for a mental health chatbot has been established in this 
study. In the future, focus on both clinical outcomes and nonclinical metrics is 
necessary to explore the mechanism by which mental health chatbots work on 
patients. Further evidence is required to confirm the long-term effectiveness of 
the mental health chatbot via trails replicated with a longer dose, as well as 
exploration of its stronger efficacy in comparison with other active controls.

The mental health care available for depression and anxiety has recently 
undergone a major technological revolution, with growing interest towards the 
potential of smartphone apps as a scalable tool to treat these conditions. Since 
the last comprehensive meta-analysis in 2019 established positive yet variable 
effects of apps on depressive and anxiety symptoms, more than 100 new randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) have been carried out. We conducted an updated 
meta-analysis with the objectives of providing more precise estimates of 
effects, quantifying generalizability from this evidence base, and understanding 
whether major app and trial characteristics moderate effect sizes. We included 
176 RCTs that aimed to treat depressive or anxiety symptoms. Apps had overall 
significant although small effects on symptoms of depression (N=33,567, g=0.28, 
p<0.001; number needed to treat, NNT=11.5) and generalized anxiety (N=22,394, 
g=0.26, p<0.001, NNT=12.4) as compared to control groups. These effects were 
robust at different follow-ups and after removing small sample and higher risk 
of bias trials. There was less variability in outcome scores at post-test in app 
compared to control conditions (ratio of variance, RoV=-0.14, 95% CI: -0.24 to 
-0.05 for depressive symptoms; RoV=-0.21, 95% CI: -0.31 to -0.12 for generalized 
anxiety symptoms). Effect sizes for depression were significantly larger when 
apps incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) features or included 
chatbot technology. Effect sizes for anxiety were significantly larger when 
trials had generalized anxiety as a primary target and administered a CBT app or 
an app with mood monitoring features. We found evidence of moderate effects of 
apps on social anxiety (g=0.52) and obsessive-compulsive (g=0.51) symptoms, a 
small effect on post-traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.12), a large effect on 
acrophobia symptoms (g=0.90), and a non-significant negative effect on panic 
symptoms (g=-0.12), although these results should be considered with caution, 
because most trials had high risk of bias and were based on small sample sizes. 
We conclude that apps have overall small but significant effects on symptoms of 
depression and generalized anxiety, and that specific features of apps - such as 
CBT or mood monitoring features and chatbot technology - are associated with 
larger effect sizes.

BACKGROUND: Despite its efficacy in treating comorbid insomnia and depression, 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited in its 
accessibility and, in many countries, cultural compatibility. Smartphone-based 
treatment is a low-cost, convenient alternative modality. This study evaluated a 
self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in alleviating major depression and insomnia.
METHODS: A parallel-group randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted 
with 320 adults with major depression and insomnia. Participants were randomized 
to receive either a 6-week CBT-I via a smartphone application, proACT-S, or 
waitlist condition. The primary outcomes included depression severity, insomnia 
severity, and sleep quality. The secondary outcomes included anxiety severity, 
subjective health, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments were administered 
at baseline, post-intervention (week 6) follow-up, and week 12 follow-up. The 
waitlist group received treatment after the week 6 follow-up.
RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis was conducted with multilevel modeling. In 
all but one model, the interaction between treatment condition and time at week 
6 follow-up was significant. Compared with the waitlist group, the treatment 
group had lower levels of depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D): Cohen's d = 0.86, 95% CI (-10.11 to -5.37)], insomnia 
[Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): Cohen's d = 1.00, 95% CI (-5.93 to -3.53)], and 
anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A): 
Cohen's d = 0.83, 95% CI (-3.75 to -1.96)]. They also had better sleep quality 
[Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Cohen's d = 0.91, 95% CI (-3.34 to 
-1.83)]. No differences across any measures were found at week 12, after the 
waitlist control group received the treatment.
CONCLUSION: proACT-S is an efficacious sleep-focused self-help treatment for 
major depression and insomnia.

IMPORTANCE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is moderately 
effective for depression when applied by trained staff. It is not known whether 
self-applied tDCS, combined or not with a digital psychological intervention, is 
also effective.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fully unsupervised home-use tDCS, combined with 
a digital psychological intervention or digital placebo, is effective for a 
major depressive episode.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a double-blinded, sham-controlled, 
randomized clinical trial with 3 arms: (1) home-use tDCS plus a digital 
psychological intervention (double active); (2) home-use tDCS plus digital 
placebo (tDCS only), and (3) sham home-use tDCS plus digital placebo (double 
sham). The study was conducted between April 2021 and October 2022 at 
participants' homes and at Instituto de Psiquiatria do Hospital das Clínicas da 
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. Included 
participants were aged 18 to 59 years with major depression and a Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale, 17-item version (HDRS-17), score above 16, a minimum of 
8 years of education, and access to a smartphone and internet at home. Exclusion 
criteria were other psychiatric disorders, except for anxiety; neurologic or 
clinical disorders; and tDCS contraindications.
INTERVENTIONS: tDCS was administered in 2-mA, 30-minute prefrontal sessions for 
15 consecutive weekdays (1-mA, 90-second duration for sham) and twice-weekly 
sessions for 3 weeks. The digital intervention consisted of 46 sessions based on 
behavioral therapy. Digital placebo was internet browsing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in HDRS-17 score at week 6.
RESULTS: Of 837 volunteers screened, 210 participants were enrolled (180 [86%] 
female; mean [SD] age, 38.9 [9.3] years) and allocated to double active 
(n = 64), tDCS only (n = 73), or double sham (n = 73). Of the 210 participants 
enrolled, 199 finished the trial. Linear mixed-effects models did not reveal 
statistically significant group differences in treatment by time interactions 
for HDRS-17 scores, and the estimated effect sizes between groups were as 
follows: double active vs tDCS only (Cohen d, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.48 to 0.58; 
P = .86), double active vs double sham (Cohen d, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.73 to 0.34; 
P = .47), and tDCS only vs double sham (Cohen d, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.76 to 0.27; 
P = .35). Skin redness and heat or burning sensations were more frequent in the 
double active and tDCS only groups. One nonfatal suicide attempt occurred in the 
tDCS only group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unsupervised home-use tDCS combined with a digital 
psychological intervention or digital placebo was not found to be superior to 
sham for treatment of a major depressive episode in this trial.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation is an effective treatment for reducing 
depression. As depressive disorders affect many people worldwide, internet-based 
behavioral activation (iBA) could provide enhanced treatment access.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether iBA is effective in reducing 
depressive symptoms and to assess the impact on secondary outcomes.
METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and CENTRAL up 
to December 2021 for eligible randomized controlled trials. In addition, a 
reference search was conducted. Title and abstract screening, as well as a 
full-text screening, was conducted by 2 independent reviewers. Randomized 
controlled trials that investigated the effectiveness of iBA for depression as a 
treatment or main component were included. Randomized controlled trials had to 
report depressive symptoms, with a quantitative outcome measure and assess an 
adult population with depressive symptoms above cutoff. Two independent 
reviewers performed the data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Data were 
pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. The primary outcome was self-reported 
depressive symptoms posttreatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis 
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) reporting guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials, with 3274 participants (88% 
female, 43.61 years) were included. iBA was more effective in reducing 
depressive symptom severity posttreatment than inactive control groups 
(standardized mean difference -0.49; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.34; P<.001). The overall 
level of heterogeneity was moderate to substantial (I2=53%). No significant 
effect of iBA on depressive symptoms could be found at 6-month follow-up. 
Participants assigned to iBA also experienced a significant reduction of anxiety 
and a significant increase in quality of life and activation compared to the 
inactive control groups. The results remained robust in multiple sensitivity 
analyses. The risk of bias assessment revealed at least some concerns for all 
studies, and there was evidence of slight publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis implies that iBA is 
effective in reducing depressive symptoms. It represents a promising treatment 
option, providing treatment access where no treatment is available yet.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders are common, and treatment often 
includes psychological interventions. Digital health interventions, delivered 
through technologies such as web-based programs and mobile apps, are 
increasingly used in mental health treatment. Acceptability, the extent to which 
an intervention is viewed positively, has been identified as contributing to 
patient adherence and engagement with digital health interventions. 
Acceptability, therefore, impacts the benefit derived from using digital health 
interventions in treatment. Understanding the acceptability of digital mental 
health interventions among patients with depression or anxiety disorders is 
essential to maximize the effectiveness of their treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This review investigated the acceptability of technology-based 
interventions among patients with depression or anxiety disorders.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and PROSPERO (International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Web 
of Science, and Ovid in May 2022. Studies were included if they evaluated 
digital interventions for the treatment of depression or anxiety disorders and 
investigated their acceptability among adult patients. Studies were excluded if 
they targeted only specific populations (eg, those with specific physical health 
conditions), investigated acceptability in healthy individuals or patients under 
the age of 18 years, involved no direct interaction between patients and 
technologies, used technology only as a platform for traditional care (eg, 
videoconferencing), had patients using technologies only in clinical or 
laboratory settings, or involved virtual reality technologies. Acceptability 
outcome data were narratively synthesized by the direction of acceptability 
using vote counting. Included studies were evaluated using levels of evidence 
from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The risk of bias was 
assessed using a tool designed for this review and GRADE (Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).
RESULTS: A total of 143 articles met the inclusion criteria, comprising 67 (47%) 
articles on interventions for depression, 65 (45%) articles on interventions for 
anxiety disorders, and 11 (8%) articles on interventions for both. Overall, 90 
(63%) were randomized controlled trials, 50 (35%) were other quantitative 
studies, and 3 (2%) were qualitative studies. Interventions used web-based 
programs, mobile apps, and computer programs. Cognitive behavioral therapy was 
the basis of 71% (102/143) of the interventions. Digital mental health 
interventions were generally acceptable among patients with depression or 
anxiety disorders, with 88% (126/143) indicating positive acceptability, 8% 
(11/143) mixed results, and 4% (6/143) insufficient information to categorize 
the direction of acceptability. The available research evidence was of moderate 
quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital mental health interventions seem to be acceptable to 
patients with depression or anxiety disorders. Consistent use of validated 
measures for acceptability would enhance the quality of evidence. Careful design 
of acceptability as an evaluation outcome can further improve the quality of 
evidence and reduce the risk of bias.

Rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) are increasing globally, in part due to 
the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, contributing to disease burden. It has 
long been known that insomnia is intricately connected with depression as 
indicated by greater depression severity and lower treatment response. 
Furthermore, insomnia is a significant risk factor for new-onset depression. 
Treatment of insomnia is thus a logical target for prevention of incidents and 
recurrent MDD. This systematic review sought to evaluate the current evidence 
for the preventive effects of insomnia treatment on depression onset. A database 
search yielded 186 studies, six of which met criteria for inclusion in this 
review. All of the studies utilized cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia 
(CBT-I) as the target intervention and most delivered treatment via a digital 
platform. Four of the studies found significantly lower rates of MDD onset in 
those who received CBT-I compared to a control condition. The two remaining 
studies failed to confirm these effects in primary analyses but secondary 
analyses suggested evidence of a preventive effect. There was significant 
methodologic heterogeneity across studies in terms of sample selection, 
outcomes, and follow-up periods, limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions. 
The evidence overall is in the direction of insomnia treatment reducing the risk 
for onset of MDD, but further research is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a complex period that implies many biopsychosocial 
changes, and the way women adapt to these changes impacts their well-being and 
the chances of developing mental health problems. During the perinatal period, 
women have expressed a preference for support delivered on the web. In this 
regard, interventions such as behavioral activation (BA), which are brief and 
structured psychosocial interventions, seem particularly suited to be delivered 
through digital solutions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to map the literature investigating digital BA 
interventions deployed during the perinatal period. We paid particular attention 
to the methodological underpinnings of the studies, the potential impact of BA 
interventions on symptoms other than depression, and the existence of 
differences occurring when these interventions were administered during 
pregnancy versus the postpartum period.
METHODS: A systematic search compliant with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews) 
guidelines was conducted considering 5 bibliographic databases; reference lists 
and key journals were also screened by 2 independent authors following a 
double-blind approach.
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies published between 2013 and 2022 were included. In 
total, 2 studies were protocols for randomized controlled trials, 5 were 
empirical studies, and 1 was a qualitative study. All studies focused on the 
postpartum period, except for 1 that focused on the broader perinatal period. 
Promising effects on depression symptoms were reported but not on other 
psychosocial symptoms. Low intervention adherence has emerged, whereas the 
usability associated with the digital means used to deploy interventions was 
scarcely addressed; moreover, information on the digital platforms used was 
poorly reported overall.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the scarcity and preliminary nature of 
digital BA interventions deployed during the perinatal period, where the focus 
seems more on treatment rather than prevention. Moreover, future studies should 
also consider and address usability and user engagement, given their relevance 
to intervention efficacy.

Major depression (MDD) is a common and disabling disorder. Research has shown 
that most people with MDD receive either no treatment or inadequate treatment. 
Computer and mobile technologies may offer solutions for the delivery of 
therapies to untreated or inadequately treated individuals with MDD. The authors 
review currently available technologies and research aimed at relieving symptoms 
of MDD. These technologies include computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy 
(CCBT), web-based self-help, Internet self-help support groups, mobile 
psychotherapeutic interventions (i.e., mobile applications or apps), technology 
enhanced exercise, and biosensing technology.

Women in low- and middle-income countries have high rates of perinatal 
depression. As smartphones become increasingly accessible around the world, 
there is an opportunity to explore innovative mHealth tools for the prevention, 
screening, and management of perinatal depression. We completed a scoping review 
of the literature pertaining to the use of mobile phone technologies for 
perinatal depression in low-and middle-income countries. PubMed CINHAL, and 
Google Scholar databases were searched, generating 423 results. 12 articles met 
our inclusion criteria. Two of the 12 articles reviewed mobile phone 
applications. The remaining 9 articles were study protocols or 
descriptive/intervention studies. Our results reveal that minimal literature is 
currently available on the use of mobile health for perinatal depression in low- 
and middle-income countries. We found four articles that present the results of 
an intervention that were delivered through mobile phones for the treatment of 
perinatal depressive symptoms and an additional qualitative study describing the 
perceptions of mothers receiving cognitive behavioral therapy via telephones. 
These studies demonstrated that depressive symptoms improved after the 
interventions. There is potential to improve the quality of mHealth 
interventions, specifically mobile phone applications for perinatal depressive 
symptoms and depression, through meaningful collaborative work between 
healthcare professionals and application developers.

INTRODUCTION: Smartphone app interventions based on cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) are promising scalable alternatives for treating mental disorders, but the 
evidence of their efficacy for postpartum depression is limited. We assessed the 
efficacy of Motherly, a standalone CBT-based smartphone app, in reducing 
symptoms of postpartum depression.
METHODS: Women aged 18-40 with symptoms of postpartum depression were randomized 
either to intervention (Motherly app) or active control (COMVC app). The primary 
outcome was symptoms of depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale (EPDS) at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes were anxiety 
symptoms, parental stress, quality of sleep, behavioral activation, availability 
of response-contingent positive reinforcement, and clinical improvement at 
post-treatment and 1-month follow-up. Exploratory analyses were performed to 
investigate if app engagement was associated with treatment response.
RESULTS: From November 2021 to August 2022, 1,751 women volunteered, of which 
264 were randomized, and 215 provided primary outcome data. No statistically 
significant differences were found between groups at post-treatment: 
intervention: mean (SD): 12.75 (5.52); active control: 13.28 (5.32); p = 0.604. 
There was a statistically significant effect of the intervention on some of the 
secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggest a dose-response relationship 
between Motherly app engagement and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Our standalone app intervention did not significantly reduce 
postnatal depression symptoms when compared to active control. Exploratory 
findings suggest that negative findings might be associated with insufficient 
app engagement. Consistent with current literature, our findings suggest that 
standalone app interventions for postpartum depression are not ready to be 
implemented in clinical practice.

AIM: Patients with cancer experience various forms of psychological distress, 
including depressive symptoms, which can impact quality of life, elevate 
morbidity risk, and increase medical costs. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy 
are effective for reducing depressive symptoms among patients with cancer, but 
most patients prefer psychotherapy. This study aimed to develop an efficient and 
effective smartphone psychotherapy component to address depressive symptom.
METHODS: This was a decentralized, parallel-group, multicenter, open, 
individually randomized, fully factorial trial. Patients aged ≥20 years with 
cancer were randomized by the presence/absence of three cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT) skills (behavioral activation [BA], assertiveness training [AT], 
and problem-solving [PS]) on a smartphone app. All participants received 
psychoeducation (PE). The primary outcome was change in the patient health 
questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score between baseline and week 8. Secondary 
outcomes included anxiety.
RESULTS: In total, 359 participants were randomized. Primary outcome data at 
week 8 were obtained for 355 participants (99%). The week 8 PHQ-9 total score 
was significantly reduced from baseline for all participants by -1.41 points 
(95% confidence interval [CI] -1.89, -0.92), but between-group differences in 
change scores were not significant (BA: -0.04, 95% CI -0.75, 0.67; AT: -0.16, 
95% CI -0.87, 0.55; PS: -0.19, 95% CI -0.90, 0.52).
CONCLUSION: As the presence of any of the three intervention components did not 
contribute to a significant additive reduction of depressive symptoms, we cannot 
make evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of specific smartphone 
psychotherapy.

Depression during pregnancy is a significant public health problem that is 
associated with adverse consequences for women and children. Despite the 
availability of treatment options, depression during pregnancy is often 
undertreated. Most pregnant women prefer nonpharmacological interventions over 
antidepressant medications. We review the evidence base for psychotherapeutic 
treatment approaches to depression during pregnancy. Treatments reviewed include 
interpersonal therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, and 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. We review both traditional face-to-face 
delivery and digital interventions. We conclude with recommendations for 
treatment preferences, collaborative decision-making, and strategies to improve 
uptake of such services among prenatal women.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents one of the major treatment options 
for depressive disorders besides pharmacological interventions. While newly 
developed digital CBT approaches hold important advantages due to higher 
accessibility, their relative effectiveness compared to traditional CBT remains 
unclear. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify all studies 
that conducted a CBT-based intervention (face-to-face or digital) in patients 
with major depression. Random-effects meta-analytic models of the standardized 
mean change using raw score standardization (SMCR) were computed. In 106 studies 
including n = 11854 patients face-to-face CBT shows superior clinical 
effectiveness compared to digital CBT when investigating depressive symptoms 
(p < 0.001, face-to-face CBT: SMCR = 1.97, 95%-CI: 1.74-2.13, digital CBT: 
SMCR = 1.20, 95%-CI: 1.08-1.32) and adherence (p = 0.014, face-to-face CBT: 
82.4%, digital CBT: 72.9%). However, after accounting for differences between 
face-to-face and digital CBT studies, both approaches indicate similar 
effectiveness. Important variables with significant moderation effects include 
duration of the intervention, baseline severity, adherence and the level of 
human guidance in digital CBT interventions. After accounting for potential 
confounders our analysis indicates comparable effectiveness of face-to-face and 
digital CBT approaches. These findings underline the importance of moderators of 
clinical effects and provide a basis for the future personalization of CBT 
treatment in depression.

Diverse approaches to the treatment of depressive disorders are necessary to 
improve evidence-based practice and maximize treatment outcomes. As a result, a 
range of behaviors and other factors associated with the onset and course of 
depressive disorders should be examined more comprehensively. Behavioral 
activation (BA) is a treatment approach to these disorders that can be tailored 
to address certain health behaviors within the context of depression in an 
attempt to promote health behaviors whose adoption and maintenance can prove 
complementary in the treatment of depression. We conducted a scoping review of 
published studies in which BA-based interventions were used to promote certain 
health behaviors in individuals with depression. Our search of Medline and the 
Web of Science identified 336 potential candidate studies. Following screening 
and with the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria to isolate 
potentially eligible full-text records, we ultimately identified and evaluated 
20 papers that report the nature and efficacy of these modified interventions. 
Across various domains, including substance use, exercise, medication adherence, 
and occupational and social success, we found evidence that many-but not all-of 
the studies we reviewed demonstrated that BA-based interventions were 
efficacious in promoting the health behavior of interest as well as reducing 
depressive symptomatology in participants. Implications for more widespread 
dissemination of such interventions, especially via mobile and web-based 
platforms due to their accessibility and affordability, are discussed. More 
research on the feasibility and efficacy of BA-based interventions tailored 
toward various determinants of health behavior and comorbidities of depressive 
disorders is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression constitutes a significant public health issue, 
with prevalence rates ranging between 8 and 19% in high-income nations. 
Nevertheless, numerous barriers, including time constraints, societal 
stigmatization, and feelings of shame, contribute to the limited utilization of 
healthcare services during the postpartum period. Digital interventions offer an 
opportunity to enhance care for women experiencing postpartum depressive 
symptoms.
METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial to assess the 
effectiveness of a smartphone-based intervention in comparison to a 
treatment-as-usual control group in Germany. Our aim is to randomize 556 
participants in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention group will be 
provided access to a preventive smartphone-based intervention called 
"Smart-e-Moms," which incorporates therapeutic support and comprises 10 concise 
modules rooted in cognitive-behavioral therapy. For the intervention group, 
evaluations will take place at baseline (t0), prior to sessions 4 and 8 
(intermediate assessments), and upon completing the intervention 6 weeks after 
baseline (t1). The control group's assessments will be at baseline (t0) and 
6 weeks after baseline. Follow-up assessments are scheduled at 12 and 24 weeks 
from baseline to examine the short-term stability of any observed effects. We 
anticipate that participants in the intervention group will exhibit improvements 
in their postpartum depressive symptoms (as measured with the Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale). Additionally, we will analyze secondary outcomes, 
including maternal bonding, stress levels, self-efficacy, satisfaction with the 
intervention, and healthcare utilization.
DISCUSSION: If Smart-e-Moms proves to be effective, it has the potential to play 
a significant role in postpartum depression care within German-speaking regions. 
Ideally, this intervention could not only benefit maternal well-being but also 
improve the prospects for healthy child development.

PURPOSE: We conducted a rapid evidence review to explore the benefits and harms 
of digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (dCBT) and the barriers to and 
facilitators of implementing dCBT for adolescents.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL through December 6, 2021, for 
controlled trials conducted in settings highly applicable to the United States. 
Additionally, we searched relevant systematic reviews for eligible studies. 
Results were summarized qualitatively.
RESULTS: We included 12 trials (n = 1,575) that examined the effects of nine 
dCBT programs. Overall, dCBT was slightly superior to comparators in improving 
depression symptoms immediately post-intervention, but not at a longer 
follow-up. The use of dCBT did not appear to result in an increased risk for 
suicidal attempts or ideation; however, the number of events was very small. 
Potential barriers to implementing/maintaining dCBT are challenges 
engaging/retaining patients, developing infrastructure, and training therapists 
to facilitate dCBT. Data on harms or unintended negative consequences were not 
reported in the included studies.
CONCLUSIONS: A limited body of evidence suggests that dCBT programs might 
outperform control interventions for reducing depressive symptoms immediately 
post-intervention, but not at a longer follow-up. The safety of dCBT programs 
for adolescents with depression is understudied.

Despite the growing prevalence of mental health-related smartphone apps, low 
real-world engagement has prevented these apps from transforming the mental 
health landscape. Integrating mental health apps into more traditional 
therapeutic models appears to support better clinical outcomes, but also raises 
questions about the relationship between app engagement, the app itself, and the 
coach or clinician. This study explores patient app engagement patterns and the 
associated clinical outcomes gathered from piloting a digital clinic. Patients 
with anxiety or depression completed eight clinical visits and coach visits over 
a median of 83 days with a standard deviation of 17.25 days. Between clinical 
visits, patients completed therapeutic activities on the mindLAMP app. Mean 
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores decreased from the intake visit to both visit 4 and visit 
8. Patients had high app engagement, but engagement did not correlate with 
outcomes. From intake visit to visit 4, the interaction effects indicate 
significant differences in the change of both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 depending on 
participants' average app satisfaction and clinician/coach satisfaction (as 
measured by WAI-SR) with engagement. Overall, results support the feasibility of 
incorporating an app into a hybrid clinic.

BACKGROUND: There is evidence that depression can be prevented; however, 
traditional approaches face significant scalability issues. Digital technologies 
provide a potential solution, although this has not been adequately tested. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new smartphone app 
designed to reduce depression symptoms and subsequent incident depression 
amongst a large group of Australian workers.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with follow-up assessments 
at 5 weeks and 3 and 12 months post-baseline. Participants were employed 
Australians reporting no clinically significant depression. The intervention 
group (N = 1128) was allocated to use HeadGear, a smartphone app which included 
a 30-day behavioural activation and mindfulness intervention. The 
attention-control group (N = 1143) used an app which included a 30-day mood 
monitoring component. The primary outcome was the level of depressive 
symptomatology (PHQ-9) at 3-month follow-up. Analyses were conducted within an 
intention-to-treat framework using mixed modelling.
RESULTS: Those assigned to the HeadGear arm had fewer depressive symptoms over 
the course of the trial compared to those assigned to the control (F3,734.7 = 
2.98, p = 0.031). Prevalence of depression over the 12-month period was 8.0% and 
3.5% for controls and HeadGear recipients, respectively, with odds of depression 
caseness amongst the intervention group of 0.43 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.26-0.70).
CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that a smartphone app can reduce depression 
symptoms and potentially prevent incident depression caseness and such 
interventions may have a role in improving working population mental health.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected mental health, leading 
to an increased prevalence of depression and insomnia. Currently, artificial 
intelligence (AI) and deep learning have thoroughly transformed health 
care-related mobile apps, offered more effective mental health support, and 
alleviated the psychological stress that may have emerged during the pandemic. 
Early reviews outlined the use of mobile apps for dealing with depression and 
insomnia separately. However, there is now an urgent need for a systematic 
evaluation of mobile apps that address both depression and insomnia to reveal 
new applications and research gaps.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review and evaluate mobile apps 
targeting depression and insomnia, highlighting their features, effectiveness, 
and gaps in the current research.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for 
peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2017 and 2023. The inclusion 
criteria were studies that (1) focused on mobile apps addressing both depression 
and insomnia, (2) involved young people or adult participants, and (3) provided 
data on treatment efficacy. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 
reviewers. Title and abstract screening, as well as full-text screening, were 
completed in duplicate. Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by 
a second reviewer, and risk of bias assessments were completed accordingly.
RESULTS: Of the initial 383 studies we found, 365 were excluded after title, 
abstract screening, and removal of duplicates. Eventually, 18 full-text articles 
met our criteria and underwent full-text screening. The analysis revealed that 
mobile apps related to depression and insomnia were primarily utilized for early 
detection, assessment, and screening (n=5 studies); counseling and psychological 
support (n=3 studies); and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n=10 studies). 
Among the 10 studies related to depression, our findings showed that chatbots 
demonstrated significant advantages in improving depression symptoms, a 
promising development in the field. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the 
effectiveness of mobile apps as alternative interventions for depression and 
sleep, further expanding the potential applications of this technology.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of AI and deep learning into mobile apps, 
particularly chatbots, is a promising avenue for personalized mental health 
support. Through innovative features, such as early detection, assessment, 
counseling, and CBT, these apps significantly contribute toward improving sleep 
quality and addressing depression. The reviewed chatbots leveraged advanced 
technologies, including natural language processing, machine learning, and 
generative dialog, to provide intelligent and autonomous interactions. Compared 
with traditional face-to-face therapies, their feasibility, acceptability, and 
potential efficacy highlight their user-friendly, cost-effective, and accessible 
nature with the aim of enhancing sleep and mental health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Depression is common among adults who smoke cigarettes. Existing 
depression-specific cessation interventions have limited reach and are unlikely 
to improve smoking prevalence rates among this large subgroup of smokers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether a mobile app-based intervention 
tailored for depression paired with a mailed sample of nicotine replacement 
therapy (NRT) is efficacious for treating depression and promoting smoking 
cessation.
METHODS: A 2-arm nationwide remote randomized clinical trial was conducted in 
the United States. Adults (N=150) with elevated depressive symptoms (Patient 
Health Questionnaire-8≥10) who smoked were enrolled. The mobile app 
("Goal2Quit") provided behavioral strategies for treating depression and 
quitting smoking based on Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression. 
Goal2Quit participants also received a 2-week sample of combination NRT. 
Treatment as usual participants received a self-help booklet for quitting 
smoking that was not tailored for depression. Primary end points included 
Goal2Quit usability, change in depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II) across 
12 weeks, and smoking cessation including reduction in cigarettes per day, 
incidence of 24-hour quit attempts, floating abstinence, and 7-day point 
prevalence abstinence (PPA).
RESULTS: In total, 150 participants were enrolled between June 25, 2020, and 
February 23, 2022, of which 80 were female (53.3%) and the mean age was 38.4 (SD 
10.3) years. At baseline, participants on average reported moderate depressive 
symptoms and smoked a mean of 14.7 (SD 7.5) cigarettes per day. Goal2Quit 
usability was strong with a mean usability rating on the System Usability Scale 
of 78.5 (SD 16.9), with 70% scoring above the ≥68 cutoff for above-average 
usability. Retention data for app use were generally strong immediately 
following trial enrollment and declined in subsequent weeks. Those who received 
Goal2Quit and the NRT sample reported lower mean depressive symptoms over the 
trial duration as compared to treatment as usual (difference of mean 3.72, SE 
1.37 points less; P=.01). Across time points, all cessation outcomes favored 
Goal2Quit. Regarding abstinence, Goal2Quit participants reported significantly 
higher rates of 7-day PPA at weeks 4 (11% vs 0%; P=.02), 8 (7-day PPA: 12% vs 
0%; P=.02), and 12 (16% vs 2%; P=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A mobile app intervention tailored for depression paired with a 
sample of NRT was effective for depression treatment and smoking cessation. 
Findings support the utility of this intervention approach for addressing the 
currently unmet public health treatment need for tailored, scalable 
depression-specific cessation treatments.

BACKGROUND: Among youth, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol use are 
associated with considerable illness and disability. Youth face many personal 
and health system barriers in accessing mental health care. Mobile applications 
(apps) offer youth potentially accessible, scalable, and anonymous therapy and 
other support. Recent systematic reviews on apps to reduce mental health 
symptoms among youth have reported uncertain effectiveness, but analyses based 
on the type of app-delivered therapy are limited.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted this systematic review with youth co-researchers to 
ensure that this review addressed the questions that were most important to 
them. The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence 
on the effectiveness of mobile apps for the reduction of depressive symptoms 
(depression, generalized anxiety, psychological distress) and alcohol use among 
youth.
SEARCH METHODS: We conducted electronic searches of the following bibliographic 
databases for studies published between January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2022: 
MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), CINAHL (via 
EBSCOHost), and CENTRAL (via the Cochrane Library). The search used a 
combination of indexed terms, free text words, and MeSH headings. We manually 
screened the references of relevant systematic reviews and included randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors 
for full reports of identified trial registries or protocols.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs conducted among youth aged 15-24 years from 
any setting. We did not exclude populations on the basis of gender, 
socioeconomic status, geographic location or other personal characteristics. We 
included studies which assessed the effectiveness of app-delivered mental health 
support or therapy interventions that targeted the management of depressive 
disorders and/or alcohol use disorders. We excluded apps that targeted general 
wellness, apps which focused on prevention of psychological disorders and apps 
that targeted bipolar disorder, psychosis, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders 
(aside from alcohol), and sleep disorders. Eligible comparisons included usual 
care, no intervention, wait-list control, alternative or controlled mobile 
applications. We included studies which reported outcomes on depressive 
symptoms, anxiety symptoms, alcohol use and psychological distress over any 
follow-up period.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We standardized the PICO definitions (population, 
intervention, comparison, and outcome) of each included study and grouped 
studies by the type of therapy or support offered by the app. Whenever app 
design and clinical homogeneity allowed, we meta-analyzed outcomes using a 
random-effects model. Outcome data measured using categorical scales were 
synthesized using odds ratios. Outcome data measured using continuous scales 
were synthesized as the standardized mean difference. We assessed the 
methodological quality of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
2.0 tool and we assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: From 5280 unique citations, we included 36 RCTs published in 37 
reports and conducted in 15 different countries (7984 participants). Among the 
36 included trials, we assessed two with an overall low risk of bias, 8 trials 
with some concern regarding risk of bias, and 26 trials with a high risk of 
bias. Interventions varied in the type of therapy or supports offered. The most 
common intervention designs employed mindfulness training, cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT), or a combination of the two (mindfulness + CBT). However, other 
interventions also included self-monitoring, medication reminders, cognitive 
bias modification or positive stimulation, dialectical behavioral therapy, 
gamified health promotion, or social skill building. Mindfulness apps led to 
short term improvements in depressive symptoms when compared to a withheld 
control (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI [-0.63, -0.10]; p = 0.007, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very 
low certainty) and when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI 
[-0.53, -0.01]; p = 0.04, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Apps delivering this 
type of support also significantly improved symptoms of anxiety when compared to 
a withheld control (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI [-0.60, -0.09]; p = 0.008, n = 3 RCTs, 
GRADE: very low) but not when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.24; 95% CI 
[-0.50, 0.02]; p = 0.07, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Mindfulness apps showed 
improvements in psychological stress that approached statistical significance 
among participants receiving the mindfulness mobile apps compared to those in 
the withheld control (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI [-0.56, 0.03]; p = .07, n = 4 RCTs, 
GRADE: very low). CBT apps also led to short-term improvements in depressive 
symptoms when compared to a withheld control (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI [-0.80, 0.01]; 
p = 0.05, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low) and when compared to an active control 
(SMD = -0.59; 95% CI [-0.98, -0.19]; p = 0.003, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). 
CBT-based apps also improved symptoms of anxiety compared to a withheld control 
(SMD = -0.51; 95% CI [-0.94, -0.09]; p = 0.02, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very low) but 
not when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI [-1.11, 0.59]; 
p = 0.55, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Apps which combined mindfulness and CBT 
did not significantly improve symptoms of depression (SMD = -0.20; 95% CI 
[-0.42, 0.02]; p = 0.07, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low) or anxiety (SMD = -0.21; 
95% CI [-0.49, 0.07]; p = 0.14, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). However, these 
apps did improve psychological distress (SMD = -0.43; 95% CI [-0.74, -0.12]; 
p = 0.006, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). The results of trials on apps to reduce 
alcohol use were inconsistent. We did not identify any harms associated with the 
use of apps to manage mental health concerns. All effectiveness results had a 
very low certainty of evidence rating using the GRADE approach, meaning that 
apps which deliver therapy or other mental health support may reduce symptoms of 
depression, anxiety and psychological distress but the evidence is very 
uncertain.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed evidence from 36 trials conducted among youth. 
According to our meta-analyses, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect 
of apps on depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and alcohol use. Very 
few effects were interpreted to be of clinical importance. Most of the RCTs were 
small studies focusing on efficacy for youth at risk for depressive symptoms. 
Larger trials are needed to evaluate effectiveness and allow for further 
analysis of subgroup differences. Longer trials are also needed to better 
estimate the clinical importance of these apps over the long term.

Adolescents and young adults frequently experience anxiety and depression. The 
authors evaluated engagement in and effects of a coach-enhanced digital 
cognitive-behavioral intervention (dCBI; RxWell) targeting emotional distress in 
this age group. The dCBI app was prescribed to 506 adolescents and young adults 
at 35 pediatric practices; 278 enrolled in the app, of whom 58% engaged and 63% 
messaged their coach. Patients completed monthly General Anxiety Disorder-7 and 
eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire assessments, and a subset completed 
qualitative interviews. The dCBI app was associated with a significant reduction 
in anxiety and depression at 1 and 3 months. A dCBI is feasible as part of 
routine pediatric care and associated with reduced emotional distress.

The efficacy of Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for depression 
in adults is well established. Yet, comprehensive knowledge on the mediators 
responsible for therapeutic change in these interventions is pending. Therefore, 
we conducted the first systematic review on mediators in IMIs for depression, 
investigating mechanisms of change in interventions with different theoretical 
backgrounds and delivery modes (PROSPERO CRD42019130301). Two independent 
reviewers screened references from five databases (i.e., Cochrane Library, 
Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO and ICTRP), selected studies for inclusion and 
extracted data from eligible studies. We included 26 RCTs on mediators in IMIs 
for depression (6820 participants), rated their risk of bias and adherence to 
methodological quality criteria for psychotherapy process research. Primary 
studies examined 64 mediators, with cognitive variables (e.g., perceived 
control, rumination or interpretation bias) being the largest group of both 
examined (m = 28) and significant mediators (m = 22); followed by a range of 
other mediators, including mindfulness, acceptance and behavioral activation. 
Our findings might contribute to the empirically-informed advancement of 
interventions and mental health care practices, enabling optimized treatment 
outcomes for patients with depression. Furthermore, we discuss implications for 
future research and provide methodological recommendations for forthcoming 
mediation studies with more pertinent designs, allowing for inferences with 
higher causal specificity.

The convergence of mobile software, artificial intelligence, and biomedical 
science is ushering in a new era of precision medicine, defined not only by 
personalization but by real-time adaptability. This shift is exemplified by the 
evolution of Prescription Digital Therapeutics (PDTs): smartphone-based 
applications that treat a disease or condition and are regulated in the US by 
the FDA. Early PDTs (PDT 1.0) such as reSET for substance use disorder, reSET-O 
for opioid use disorder, and Somryst for chronic insomnia digitized cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) into a smartphone app and laid the foundation for 
regulated digital interventions. Now in the era of PDT 2.0, we see greater 
personalization, multimodal approaches beyond CBT, robust clinical validation, 
and targeting drug-like endpoints with Rejoyn for major depressive disorder, 
CT-132 for episodic migraine prevention, Luminopia for amblyopia, and CT-155 in 
development for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite promising results, 
widespread adoption remains limited by reimbursement, clinician and patient 
awareness, and integration into clinical workflows. On the horizon is smart 
medicine: a convergence of traditional pharmacotherapy with PDTs that work 
together to enhance overall effectiveness, safety and tolerability, and 
engagement, adherence, and personalization. These medicines optimize outcomes in 
ways conventional therapies cannot and, in true closed-loop principles, assess 
for disease and symptoms and modulate both the digital and drug interventions. 
Drawing from my work experience on multiple PDTs, this paper highlights how PDTs 
are transforming care. The FDA's Prescription Drug Use-Related Software (PDURS) 
guidance affirms the regulatory foundation for integrating PDTs and drugs. 
Meaningful therapeutic advancements now depend not only on the molecular design 
but also on the mechanisms, digital or otherwise, that support its success. I 
postulate that within the next five years, omitting digital interventions when 
indicated will not just be outdated, it may be malpractice.

BACKGROUND: College students are one of the most susceptible age groups to 
mental health problems. With the growing popularity of mobile health (mHealth), 
there is an increasing need to investigate its implications for mental health 
solutions. This review evaluates mHealth interventions for addressing mental 
health problems among college students.
METHODS: An online database search was conducted. Articles were required to 
focus on the impact of mHealth intervention on student mental health. Fifteen of 
the 487 articles, initially pulled from the search query, were included in the 
review.
RESULTS: The review identified three primary aspects of mental health: 
depression, anxiety, and stress. Research that found statistically significant 
improvements following mHealth intervention involved study durations between 
four and eight weeks, daily app use, guided lessons using cognitive behavioral 
therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and meditation. The review's 
findings show that future work must address the concern of digital divide, 
gender and sex differences, and have larger sample sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: There is potential to improve depressive symptoms and other similar 
mental health problems among college students via mobile app interventions. 
However, actions must be taken to improve barriers to communication and better 
reach the younger generations.

Depression is a common mental health condition for which many mobile apps aim to 
provide support. This review aims to identify self-help apps available 
exclusively for people with depression and evaluate those that offer cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) or behavioural activation (BA). One hundred and 
seventeen apps have been identified after searching both the scientific 
literature and the commercial market. 10.26% (n = 12) of these apps identified 
through our search offer support that seems to be consistent with evidence-based 
principles of CBT or BA. Taking into account the non existence of 
effectiveness/efficacy studies, and the low level of adherence to the core 
ingredients of the CBT/BA models, the utility of these CBT/BA apps are 
questionable. The usability of reviewed apps is highly variable and they rarely 
are accompanied by explicit privacy or safety policies. Despite the growing 
public demand, there is a concerning lack of appropiate CBT or BA apps, 
especially from a clinical and legal point of view. The application of superior 
scientific, technological, and legal knowledge is needed to improve the 
development, testing, and accessibility of apps for people with depression.

OBJECTIVES: Despite a large number of mobile apps in the field of mental health, 
it is difficult to find a useful and reliable one, mainly due to the fact that 
the effectiveness of many apps has not been assessed scientifically. The present 
study aimed to assess the effects of mental health apps on managing the symptoms 
of stress, anxiety, and depression.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, 
EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for the papers published from 
2000 to 2019. Studies were included if they reviewed articles or mobile apps for 
their effectiveness in stress, anxiety, and depression. The reviews that had 
considered mobile apps or web-based mobile applications as an intervention or 
part of intervention were included, as well.
RESULTS: A total of 4,999 peer-reviewed articles were identified, out of which 
nine systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Seven systematic reviews 
measured depression outcomes, three measured stress, and five systematic reviews 
measured anxiety symptoms. The applications that used behavior change 
strategies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment 
Therapy, and Behavioral Activation, reported significant effects on depression, 
anxiety, and stress.
CONCLUSION: It seems that mental health apps can be promising media for reducing 
depressive symptoms. This field is an emerging area of mobile health, and 
further research should be done in future in order to reach conclusive evidence.

BACKGROUND: Poor mental health among university students remains a pressing 
public health issue. Over the past few years, digital health interventions have 
been developed and considered promising in increasing psychological wellbeing 
among university students. Therefore, this umbrella review aims to synthesize 
evidence on digital health interventions targeting university students and to 
evaluate their effectiveness.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 2021 searching 
PubMed, Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection, Web of Science, ERIC, and 
Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health 
interventions targeting university students. The review protocol was registered 
in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO 
[CRD42021234773].
RESULTS: The initital literature search resulted in 806 records of which seven 
remained after duplicates were removed and evaluated against the inclusion 
criteria. Effectiveness was reported and categorized into the following six 
delivery types: (a) web-based, online/computer-delivered interventions (b) 
computer-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), (c) mobile applications and 
short message service (d) virtual reality interventions (e) skills training (f) 
relaxation and exposure-based therapy. Results indicated web-based 
online/computer delivered-interventions were effective or at least partially 
effective at decressing depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorder 
symptoms. This was similar for skills-training interventions, CBT-based 
intervention and mobile applications. However, digital mental health 
interventions using virtual reality and relaxation, exposure-based therapy was 
inconclusive. Due to the variation in study settings and inconsistencies in 
reporting, effectiveness was greatly dependent on the delivery format, targeted 
mental health problem and targeted purpose group.
CONCLUSION: The findings provide evidence for the beneficial effect of digital 
mental health interventions for university students. However, this review calls 
for a more systematic approach in testing and reporting the effectiveness of 
digital mental health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) is rooted in the behavioral theory of 
depression, which states that increased exposure to meaningful, rewarding 
activities is a critical factor in the treatment of depression. Assessing 
constructs relevant to BA currently requires the administration of standardized 
instruments, such as the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS), 
which places a burden on patients and providers, among other potential 
limitations. Previous work has shown that depressed and nondepressed individuals 
may use language differently and that automated tools can detect these 
differences. The increasing use of online, chat-based mental health counseling 
presents an unparalleled resource for automated longitudinal linguistic analysis 
of patients with depression, with the potential to illuminate the role of reward 
exposure in recovery.
OBJECTIVE: This work investigated how linguistic indicators of planning and 
participation in enjoyable activities identified in online, text-based 
counseling sessions relate to depression symptomatology over time.
METHODS: Using distributional semantics methods applied to a large corpus of 
text-based online therapy sessions, we devised a set of novel BA-related 
categories for the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software package. We 
then analyzed the language used by 10,000 patients in online therapy chat logs 
for indicators of activation and other depression-related markers using LIWC.
RESULTS: Despite their conceptual and operational differences, both previously 
established LIWC markers of depression and our novel linguistic indicators of 
activation were strongly associated with depression scores (Patient Health 
Questionnaire [PHQ]-9) and longitudinal patient trajectories. Emotional tone; 
pronoun rates; words related to sadness, health, and biology; and BA-related 
LIWC categories appear to be complementary, explaining more of the variance in 
the PHQ score together than they do independently.
CONCLUSIONS: This study enables further work in automated diagnosis and 
assessment of depression, the refinement of BA psychotherapeutic strategies, and 
the development of predictive models for decision support.

BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents is a large and growing problem; however, 
access to effective mental health care continues to be a challenge. Digitally 
based interventions may serve to bridge this access gap for adolescents in need 
of care. Digital interventions that deliver components of cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, and virtual 
reality (VR) may be a promising adjunctive component. However, research on these 
types of treatments in adolescents and young adults is limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of Spark (v1.0), a 5-week, self-guided, CBT-based digital 
program using a mobile app and VR experiences to target symptoms of depression 
in adolescents.
METHODS: A single-arm, open-label study of the Spark program was conducted with 
a community sample of 30 adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years with 
self-reported moderate to severe depression symptoms. Participants completed a 
weekly depression assessment (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) in the app during 
the 5-week intervention period as well as web-based baseline, postintervention, 
and 1-month follow-up self-report assessments. The participants also completed a 
qualitative postintervention interview. For participants aged <18 years, 
caregivers completed assessments at baseline and postintervention time points. 
Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rate (the proportion of participants 
who enrolled in the study divided by the total number of participants screened 
for eligibility) and retention rate (the proportion of participants who 
completed postintervention assessments divided by the total number of 
participants who received the intervention). Acceptability outcomes included 
engagement with the program and quantitative and qualitative feedback about the 
program. Preliminary efficacy was evaluated based on the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-8.
RESULTS: The study recruitment (31/66, 47%) and retention (29/30, 97%) rates 
were high. Participants provided higher ratings for the ease of use of the Spark 
program (8.76 out of 10) and their enjoyment of both the mobile app (7.00 out of 
10) and VR components (7.48 out of 10) of the program, whereas they provided 
lower ratings for the program's ability to improve mood (4.38 out of 10) or fit 
into their daily routines (5.69 out of 10). We observed a clinically and 
statistically significant reduction in depression scores at postintervention 
(mean difference 5.36; P<.001) and 1-month follow-up (mean difference 6.44; 
P<.001) time points.
CONCLUSIONS: The Spark program was found to be a feasible and acceptable way to 
deliver a self-guided CBT-focused intervention to adolescents and young adults 
with symptoms of depression. Preliminary data also indicated that the Spark 
program reduced the symptoms of depression in adolescents and young adults. 
Future studies should evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in an 
adequately powered randomized controlled trial.

The present study aimed at identifying the nature of mobile apps available to 
Indian android phone users who might search for free apps to help them deal with 
depression. The specific objectives were to examine the available interactive 
self-care apps in terms of guidance provided to users to make decisions 
regarding use of app, inclusion of elements that encourage professional 
help-seeking, guidance regarding managing psychological crisis and the range of 
therapeutic strategies incorporated. Using the search term 'depression', 278 
apps were identified in the first step and these spanned a wide range of 
categories. Information on coping with depression and stand alone screening 
tools formed the two largest types of free apps. Features of interactive 
self-care apps (N = 33) were reviewed further and this exercise showed that less 
than 10% of the apps incorporated explicit delineation of their scope or initial 
screening for suitability. Guidance regarding managing suicidal crisis were 
incorporated in only about 12% of the interactive apps. Slightly more than one 
third of these apps included content aimed at encouraging professional help 
seeking when needed or an explicit mention of their theoretical or empirical 
basis. Monitoring moods, thoughts and behaviors were the commonest therapeutic 
strategies incorporated in these apps, in addition, to a wide range of other 
strategies such as behavioral activation, identifying and correcting cognitive 
errors, mindfulness exercises, cultivation of gratitude, and medication 
management. The challenges for a potential user of these apps are discussed and 
ways to address the same are highlighted.

INTRODUCTION: Behavioral activation (BA) is an effective intervention for both 
depression and substance use disorders. Combining BA with a standard smoking 
cessation intervention may improve quit rates by addressing depressive symptoms, 
a key barrier to quitting. This study preliminarily evaluated the acceptability 
and efficacy of the BA-based Actify! mobile health application (mHealth app) for 
smoking cessation.
AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (n = 242) 
comparing Actify! with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) app for smoking 
cessation (QuitGuide) on acceptability (user satisfaction, app openings), 
smoking abstinence, and mechanisms of change (BA and depressive symptoms) at 8 
weeks and 6 months postrandomization. Participants were US adults recruited 
online who smoked daily.
RESULTS: Treatment satisfaction was uniformly higher in the Actify! arm. Number 
of app openings was similar across arms (M = 34.3 openings over 8 weeks in both 
arms). Self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 8 weeks was 
12.6% for Actify! versus 7.3% for QuitGuide. Differences in 30-day PPA continued 
through 6 months (18.5% for Actify! vs. 12.2% for QuitGuide). Changes between 
baseline and 8 weeks in depressive symptoms and BA favored Actify!. Planned 
subgroup analyses suggested greater benefit of Actify! among participants with 
pretreatment mild-to-moderate depression symptom severity compared to those with 
no depression symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Actify! showed considerable promise as a novel mHealth treatment, 
as evidenced by its high usage and higher user satisfaction and quit rates than 
QuitGuide at both short- and long-term follow-up. The next step is to evaluate 
Actify! in a fully powered efficacy trial.
IMPLICATIONS: Study findings demonstrate the promise of a BA-based mobile health 
app (Actify!) for smoking cessation as a population-level intervention that can 
effectively address depressive symptoms as a risk factor for worse smoking 
treatment outcomes. The Actify! app is the first standalone BA-based app to 
demonstrate potential for improved acceptability and efficacy relative to a 
standard care comparison app, with user satisfaction and smoking quit rates 
descriptively exceeding those of the NCI's QuitGuide app.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone-based application providing 
tinnitus-specific cognitive behavioral therapy and customized sound therapy for 
tinnitus.
METHODS: In a prospective randomized controlled trial, the treatment group 
participated in daily sound therapy and weekly interactive CBT modules, and the 
control group did not receive the program (waitlisted). Outcome measures after 
8 weeks included the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Perceived Stress Scale 
(PSS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (mean age = 57.2 ± 11.9 years) were included. The 
treatment (n = 47) and control (n = 45) cohorts had similar TFI, PHQ-9, GAD-7, 
PSS, and PSQI scores at presentation (all P > .05). Treatment-group patients had 
significantly higher improvements than controlled patients in their TFI 
(16.7 ± 14.9 vs 1.9 ± 10.8, P < .001), PHQ-9 (1.9 ± 4.2 vs -0.7 ± 3.4, 
P = .002), GAD-7 (1.1 ± 3.6 vs -0.9 ± 3.3, P = .009), and PSQI scores (2.5 ± 3.2 
vs -1.1 ± 2.1, P < .001). Treatment-group subjects also significantly improved 
in 7 of the 8 TFI domains (all P < .05). TFI improvements of ≥20 occurred in 18 
(38.3%) treatment subjects. Of the 9 treatment-group patients presenting with 
moderate-severe depression, 4 (44.4%) improved to minimal depression. Of the 4 
treatment-group patients with moderate-severe anxiety, 2 (50.0%) improved to 
minimal anxiety. Of the 17 treatment-group patients with moderate-severe sleep 
difficulties, 10 (55.6%) had considerable sleep improvement.
CONCLUSION: This novel smartphone application providing cognitive behavioral 
therapy and customized sound therapy was effective in reducing symptom severity 
and improving anxiety, sleep, and mood for tinnitus patients.

College students are at a high risk of mental health problems due to continuous 
exposure to considerable stress as they transition into adulthood. It is 
necessary to reflect on young people's needs and provide brief, personalized 
support interventions via mobile applications. This study aimed to (1) describe 
the co-design development process of a behavioral activation (BA) mobile health 
application called MEndorphins to help youth manage stress; and (2) evaluate the 
ease of use and quality of the application and its effects on psychological 
distress. College students aged 18-25 in South Korea participated as 
co-designers throughout the MEndorphins development process, which involved 
prototyping workshops. Thirty-five students also evaluated the application's 
ease of use and quality, as well as its effects on psychological distress, using 
a self-reported online questionnaire. In the pilot evaluation, ease of use 
scored 74.21 out of 100 and quality 3.72 out of 5. There were statistically 
significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress after using MEndorphins 
(p ≤ 0.001 for depression and anxiety, p = 0.001 for stress) for 7 days. In this 
developed BA based mobile application, participants could monitor their mood, 
plan stress self-management strategies, and gain motivation by sharing 
experiences.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role 
in the development of depression, supporting insomnia intervention as a 
promising approach to prevent depression in youth. This randomized controlled 
trial evaluated the effectiveness of app-based cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-I) in preventing future onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) 
in youth.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a randomized, assessor-blind, parallel 
group-controlled trial in Chinese youth (aged 15-25 years) with insomnia 
disorder and subclinical depressive symptoms. Participants were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to 6-week app-based CBT-I or 6-week app-based health education 
(HE) delivered through smartphones. Online assessments and telephone clinical 
interviews were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups. The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD. The secondary outcomes 
included depressive symptoms and insomnia at both symptom and disorder levels. 
Between September 9, 2019, and November 25, 2022, 708 participants (407 females 
[57%]; mean age, 22.1 years [SD = 1.9]) were randomly allocated to app-based 
CBT-I group (n = 354) or app-based HE group (n = 354). Thirty-seven participants 
(10%) in the intervention group and 62 participants (18%) in the control group 
developed new-onset MDD throughout the 12-month follow-up, with a hazard ratio 
of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.87; p = 0.008). The number needed to 
treat to prevent MDD at 1 year was 10.9 (6.8-26.6). The app-based CBT-I group 
has higher remission rates of insomnia disorder than the controls at 
post-intervention (52% versus 28%; relative risk 1.83 [1.49-2.24]; p < 0.001) 
and throughout 12-month follow-up. In addition, the CBT-I group reported a 
greater decrease in depressive (adjusted difference -1.0 [-1.6 to -0.5]; Cohen's 
d = 0.53; p < 0.001) and insomnia symptoms (-2.0 [-2.7 to -1.3], d = 0.78; p < 
0.001) than the controls at post-intervention and throughout 6-month follow-up. 
Insomnia was a mediator of intervention effects on depression. No adverse events 
related to the interventions were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: App-based CBT-I is effective in preventing future onset of major 
depression and improving insomnia outcomes among youth with insomnia and 
subclinical depression. These findings highlight the importance of targeting 
insomnia to prevent the onset of MDD and emphasize the need for wider 
dissemination of digital CBT-I to promote sleep and mental health in the youth 
population.

BACKGROUND: Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder, with detrimental 
effects on the patient's well-being, high disability, and a huge associated 
societal and economic cost. There are evidence-based treatments, but it is 
difficult to reach all people in need. Internet-based interventions, and more 
recently smartphone-based interventions, were explored to overcome barriers to 
access. Evidence shows them to be effective alternatives to traditional 
treatments. This paper presents the protocol of a pilot study whose primary aim 
is to investigate the efficacy of a smartphone-based serious game intervention 
for patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.
METHODS: This randomized controlled pilot trial protocol foresees two arms 
design: 1/ smartphone- based serious game intervention (based on Cognitive 
Behavior Therapy with particular emphasis on Behavioral Activation and Physical 
Activity), 2/ waiting list control group. The study is expected to recruit 40 
participants (18+), which will be randomly assigned to one of the experimental 
conditions. The duration of the intervention is two months. The primary outcome 
measure will be depressive symptomatology. Secondary outcomes will include other 
variables such as physical activity, resilience, anxiety, depression impairment, 
and positive and negative affect. Treatment expectation, satisfaction, 
usability, and game playability will also be measured. The data will be analyzed 
based on the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses.
DISCUSSION: The study aims to establish initial evidence for the efficacy of a 
smartphone-based serious game intervention, to serve as input for a larger-scale 
randomized control trial. The intervention exploits advanced smartphone 
capabilities, such as the use of a serious game as delivery mode, with the 
potential benefit of engagement and treatment adherence, and motion sensors to 
monitor and stimulate physical activity. As a secondary objective, the study 
aims to gather initial evidence on the user's expectations, satisfaction, 
usability and playability of the serious game as a treatment.

Postpartum depression is the most common mood disorder that occurs after 
childbirth, rendering it a significant public health problem. Information and 
communication technologies hold tremendous promise for expanding the reach of 
quality mental healthcare and closing the treatment gap for depression. In 
particular, given that mobile applications are inexpensive and provide 
information systematically, they are suitable as a method of health management 
that does not require visiting a medical center. The purposes of this study were 
to document the process of developing a mobile application for the 
self-management of postpartum depression and to share usability test results. 
The mobile application "Happy Mother" was developed based on the first five of 
seven stages in the mobile application development lifecycle model. Components 
of cognitive behavioral therapy were adopted to guide content development for 
"Happy Mother." The usability of the completed mobile application was tested in 
the following three steps: it increased awareness of mood, promoted 
self-management, and implemented specific methods a mother can use in her daily 
life to improve mood, including modifications made based on the results of the 
usability test.

BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is a common and important disease in clinical 
practice that decreases individual productivity and increases health care use. 
Treatments comprise medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, 
adverse medication effects and poor treatment compliance mean new therapeutic 
models are needed.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that digital therapy for panic disorder may improve 
panic disorder symptoms and that treatment response would be associated with 
brain activity changes assessed with functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
(fNIRS).
METHODS: Individuals (n=50) with a history of panic attacks were recruited. 
Symptoms were assessed before and after the use of an app for panic disorder, 
which in this study was a smartphone-based app for treating the clinical 
symptoms of panic disorder, panic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. 
The hemodynamics in the frontal cortex during the resting state were measured 
via fNIRS. The app had 4 parts: diary, education, quest, and serious games. The 
study trial was approved by the institutional review board of Chung-Ang 
University Hospital (1041078-202112-HR-349-01) and written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants.
RESULTS: The number of participants with improved panic symptoms in the app use 
group (20/25, 80%) was greater than that in the control group (6/21, 29%; 
χ21=12.3; P=.005). During treatment, the improvement in the Panic Disorder 
Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the app use group was greater than that in the 
control group (F1,44=7.03; P=.01). In the app use group, the total PDSS score 
declined by 42.5% (mean score 14.3, SD 6.5 at baseline and mean score 7.2, SD 
3.6 after the intervention), whereas the PDSS score declined by 14.6% in the 
control group (mean score 12.4, SD 5.2 at baseline and mean score 9.8, SD 7.9 
after the intervention). There were no significant differences in accumulated 
oxygenated hemoglobin (accHbO2) at baseline between the app use and control 
groups. During treatment, the reduction in accHbO2 in the right ventrolateral 
prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; F1,44=8.22; P=.006) and the right orbitofrontal cortex 
(OFC; F1,44=8.88; P=.005) was greater in the app use than the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Apps for panic disorder should effectively reduce symptoms and 
VLPFC and OFC brain activity in patients with panic disorder. The improvement of 
panic disorder symptoms was positively correlated with decreased VLPFC and OFC 
brain activity in the resting state.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a major cause for disability worldwide, and digital 
health interventions are expected to be an augmentative and effective treatment. 
According to the fast-growing field of information and communication 
technologies and its dissemination, there is a need for mapping the 
technological landscape and its benefits for users.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to give an overview of the 
digital health interventions used for depression. The main goal of this review 
was to provide a comprehensive review of the system landscape and its 
technological state and functions, as well as its evidence and benefits for 
users.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of 
the field of digital health interventions for the treatment of depression. 
PubMed, PSYNDEX, and the Cochrane Library were searched by two independent 
researchers in October 2020 to identify relevant publications of the last 10 
years, which were examined using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To 
conduct the review, we used Rayyan, a freely available web tool.
RESULTS: In total, 65 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. After 
categorizing the studies into the areas of prevention, early detection, therapy, 
and relapse prevention, we found dominant numbers of studies in the area of 
therapy (n=52). There was only one study for prevention, 5 studies for early 
detection, and 7 studies for relapse prevention. The most dominant therapy 
approaches were cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, 
and problem-solving therapy. Most of the studies revealed significant effects of 
digital health interventions when cognitive behavioral therapy was applied. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy as the most dominant form was often provided 
through web-based systems. Combined interventions consisting of web-based and 
smartphone-based approaches are increasingly found.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions for treating depression are quite 
comprehensive. There are different interventions focusing on different fields of 
care. While most interventions can be beneficial to achieve a better depression 
treatment, it can be difficult to determine which approaches are suitable. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy through digital health interventions has shown good 
effects in the treatment of depression, but treatment for depression still stays 
very individualistic.

Effectiveness of Smartphone-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Among Patients 
With Major Depression: Systematic Review of Health Implications.

University, Bielefeld, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Depression is often associated with rapid changes in mood and 
quality of life that persist for a period of 2 weeks. Despite medical 
innovations, there are problems in the provision of care. Long waiting times for 
treatment and high recurrence rates of depression cause enormous costs for 
health care systems. At the same time, comprehensive limitations in physical, 
psychological, and social dimensions are observed for patients with depression, 
which significantly reduce their quality of life. In addition to 
patient-specific limitations, undersupply and inappropriate health care have 
been determined. For this reason, new forms of care are discussed. 
Smartphone-based therapy is considered to have great potential due to its reach 
and easy accessibility. Low socioeconomic groups, which are always difficult to 
reach for public health interventions, can now be accessed due to the high 
dispersion of smartphones. There is still little information about the impact 
and mechanisms of smartphone-based therapy on depression. In a systematic 
literature review, the health implications of smartphone-based therapy were 
presented in comparison with standard care.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify and summarize the 
existing evidence regarding smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy for 
patients with depression and to present the health implications of 
smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy of considered endpoints.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant 
studies by means of inclusion and exclusion criteria. For this purpose, the 
PubMed and Psyndex databases were systematically searched using a search syntax. 
The endpoints of depressive symptoms, depression-related anxiety, self-efficacy 
or self-esteem, and quality of life were analyzed. Identified studies were 
evaluated for study quality and risk of bias. After applying the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, 8 studies were identified.
RESULTS: The studies examined in this review reported contradictory results 
regarding the investigated endpoints. In addition, due to clinical and 
methodological heterogeneity, it was difficult to derive evident results. All 
included studies reported effects on depressive symptoms. The other investigated 
endpoints were only reported by isolated studies. Only 50% (4/8) of the studies 
reported effects on depression-related anxiety, self-efficacy or self-esteem, 
and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: No clear implications of smartphone-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy could be established. Evidence for the treatment of depression using 
smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy is limited. Additional research 
projects are needed to demonstrate the effects of smartphone-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy in the context of evidence-based medicine and to enable its 
translation into standard care. Participatory technology development might help 
to address current problems in mobile health intervention studies.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are the main sources of work and social 
disabilities as well as health-related problems around the world. Digital 
therapeutic solutions using cognitive behavioral therapy have demonstrated 
efficacy in depression and anxiety. A common goal of digital health apps is to 
increase user digital engagement to improve outcomes. However, there is a 
limited understanding of the association between digital platform components and 
clinical outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to investigate the contribution of specific 
digital engagement tools to mental health conditions. We hypothesized that 
participation in coaching sessions and breathing exercises would be associated 
with a reduction in depression and anxiety.
METHODS: Depression and general anxiety symptoms were evaluated in real-world 
data cohorts using the digital health platform for digital intervention and 
monitoring change. This retrospective real-world analysis of users on a mobile 
platform-based treatment followed two cohorts of people: (1) users who started 
with moderate levels of depression and completed at least 2 depression 
assessments (n=519) and (2) users who started with moderate levels of anxiety 
and completed at least 2 anxiety assessments (n=474). Levels of depression 
(Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) 
were tracked throughout the first 16 weeks. A piecewise mixed-effects model was 
applied to model the trajectories of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 mean scores in 2 segments (1-6 weeks and 7-16 
weeks). Finally, simple slope analysis was used for the interpretation of the 
interactions probing the moderators: coaching sessions and breathing exercises 
in both depression and anxiety cohorts.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed a significant decrease in depression symptoms 
(β=-.37, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.28; P≤.001) during the period of weeks 1-6 of app 
use, which was maintained during the period of 7-16 weeks. Coach interaction 
significantly moderated the reduction in depression symptoms during the period 
of weeks 1-6 (β=-.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.001; P=.02). A significant decrease in 
anxiety symptoms (β=-.41, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.33; P≤.001) was revealed during the 
period of 1-6 weeks, which was maintained during the period of 7-16 weeks. 
Breathing exercises significantly moderated the reduction in anxiety symptoms 
during the period of 1-6 weeks (β=-.07, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated general improvement followed by a period of 
stability of depression and anxiety symptoms associated with cognitive 
behavioral therapy-based digital intervention. Interestingly, engagement with a 
coaching session but not a breathing exercise was associated with a reduction in 
depression symptoms. Moreover, breathing exercise but not engagement with a 
coaching session was associated with a reduction of anxiety symptoms. These 
findings emphasize the importance of using a personalized approach to behavioral 
health during digital health interventions.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the 
feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive-behavioral prevention intervention 
administered through a smartphone app in non-professional caregivers with 
symptoms of depression. The secondary objective was to make a preliminary 
evaluation of its effectiveness either alone or supplemented with telephone 
conference calls.
METHODS: Eighty-seven participants (Mage = 51.8 years) were randomly assigned to 
an app-based cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBIA; n = 29), CBIA supplemented 
with telephone conference calls (CBIA + CC; n = 28), or an attention control 
group (ACG; n = 30). The participants for both interventions received five 
cognitive-behavioral modules through the app, and those in CBIA + CC an 
additional 30-minute phone call in each module.
RESULTS: 3.4% of caregivers dropped out. In all groups, the number of modules 
completed was high. Participants completed a high percentage of the homework and 
were highly satisfied with both CBIA and CBIA + CC. At post-intervention, there 
was a lower incidence of depression and depressive symptoms for CBIA + CC 
compared with CBIA, and for CBIA and CBIA + CC compared with ACG.
CONCLUSION: The results supported the feasibility and acceptability of the 
cognitive-behavioral intervention, and demonstrated that telephone contact 
improves its effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) shows promise in 
the prevention of depression. However, the specific iCBT components that 
contribute to its effectiveness remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the effects of iCBT components in preventing 
depression among university students.
METHODS: Using a smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app, we randomly 
allocated university students to the presence or absence of 5 different iCBT 
components: self-monitoring, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, 
assertiveness training, and problem-solving. The active intervention lasted 8 
weeks but the app remained accessible through the follow-up. The primary outcome 
was the onset of a major depressive episode (MDE) between baseline and the 
follow-up after 52 weeks, as assessed with the computerized World Health 
Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Secondary outcomes 
included changes in the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item General 
Anxiety Disorder, and CBT Skills Scale.
RESULTS: During the 12-month follow-up, 133 of 1301 (10.22%) participants 
reported the onset of an MDE. There were no significant differences in the 
incidence of MDEs between the groups with or without each component (hazard 
ratios ranged from 0.85, 95% CI 0.60-1.20, for assertiveness training to 1.26, 
95% CI 0.88-1.79, for self-monitoring). Furthermore, there were no significant 
differences in the changes on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item 
General Anxiety Disorder, or for CBT Skills Scale between component allocation 
groups. However, significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms were 
observed among all participants at the 52-week follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we could not identify any specific iCBT components 
that were effective in preventing depression or the acquisition of CBT skills 
over the 12-month follow-up period, but all participants with and without 
intervention of each iCBT component demonstrated significant improvements in 
depressive and anxiety symptoms. Further research is needed to explore the 
potential impact of frequency of psychological assessments, nonspecific 
intervention effects, natural change in the mental state, and the baseline 
depression level.

Interventions delivered via mobile apps show particular promise in tackling the 
burden of common mental disorders. Appropriately targeting these interventions 
to at-risk populations is critical to their success. This pilot study aimed to 
assess the usability, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of an 
app-based intervention designed to target depressive symptoms in a stressed 
working population. Anchored, a smartphone app including a 30-day program of 
mindfulness and cognitive and behavioural therapeutic components, was tested in 
a pre-post pilot study with participants recruited via social media 
advertisements. Eligible participants (N = 81) were Australian adults who were 
employed and reported elevated stress levels on a single-item screening measure. 
Follow-up assessment occurred 5 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome 
measure was change in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes measuring 
change in anxiety, wellbeing, stress, resilience, exercise, alcohol use, 
absenteeism, and work performance. User feedback and in-app data were analysed 
to assess engagement and intervention adherence. At follow-up, there were 
significant reductions in depressive symptoms (t61 = 6.35; p < 0.001) and 
anxiety symptoms (t60 = 7.35; p < 0.001), along with significantly reduced cases 
of likely new onset depression compared to baseline (24% vs. 6%, p = 0.012). 
Significant improvements were also seen in wellbeing (t60 = -5.64; p < 0.001), 
resilience (t60 = -3.89; p < 0.001), stress (t61 = 11.18; p < 0.001), and 
alcohol use (t60 = 3.40; p = 0.001). Participants reported no significant 
changes in work performance, absenteeism or exercise. There were satisfactory 
levels of app usability, feasibility, and acceptability. Most participants found 
the app easy to use (93.2%), understood the app content well (83.0%), and rated 
the app highly or very highly overall (72.9%). User feedback suggestions were 
predominantly focused on improving app navigation and user interface. This pilot 
study provides encouraging evidence that Anchored has potentially beneficial 
effects, and is usable, feasible, and acceptable as an app-based intervention 
for the working population experiencing elevated stress. Further testing of 
Anchored in a randomised controlled trial is required to investigate its 
efficacy as an intervention for workplace mental ill-health.

BACKGROUND: Effective, scalable interventions are needed to prevent poor mental 
health in young people. Although mental health apps can provide scalable 
prevention, few have been rigorously tested in high-powered trials built on 
models of healthy emotional functioning or tailored to individual profiles. We 
aimed to test a personalised emotional competence app versus a cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help app versus a self-monitoring app to prevent 
an increase in depression symptoms in young people.
METHODS: This multicentre, parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trial, 
within a cohort multiple randomised trial (including a parallel trial of 
wellbeing promotion) was done at four university trial sites in the UK, Germany, 
Spain, and Belgium. Participants were recruited from schools, universities, and 
social media from the four respective countries. Eligible participants were aged 
16-22 years with increased vulnerability indexed by baseline emotional 
competence profile, without current or past diagnosis of major depression. 
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to usual practice plus either the 
personalised emotional competence self-help app, the generic CBT self-help app, 
or the self-monitoring app by an independent computerised system, minimised by 
country, age, and self-reported gender, and followed up for 12 months 
post-randomisation. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The 
primary outcome was depression symptoms (according to Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3-month follow-up, analysed in participants who 
completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. The study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04148508, and is closed.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2020, and Aug 3, 2021, 1262 participants were 
enrolled, including 417 to the emotional competence app, 423 to the CBT app, and 
422 to the self-monitoring app. Mean age was 18·8 years (SD 2·0). Of 1262 
participants self-reporting gender, 984 (78·0%) were female, 253 (20·0%) were 
male, 15 (1·2%) were neither, and ten (0·8%) were both. 178 participants in the 
emotional competence app group, 191 in the CBT app group, and 199 in the 
self-monitoring app group completed the follow-up assessment at 3 months. At 3 
months, depression symptoms were lower with the CBT app than the self-monitoring 
app (mean difference in PHQ-9 -1·18 [95% CI -2·01 to -0·34]; p=0·006), but 
depression symptoms did not differ between the emotional competence app and the 
CBT app (0·63 [-0·22 to 1·49]; p=0·15) or the self-monitoring app and emotional 
competence app (-0·54 [-1·39 to 0·31]; p=0·21). 31 of the 541 participants who 
completed any of the follow-up assessments received treatment in hospital or 
were admitted to hospital for mental health-related reasons considered unrelated 
to interventions (eight in the emotional competence app group, 15 in the CBT app 
group, and eight in the self-monitoring app group). No deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: The CBT app delayed increases in depression symptoms in at-risk 
young people relative to the self-monitoring app, although this benefit faded by 
12 months. Against hypotheses, the emotional competence app was not more 
effective at reducing depression symptoms than the self-monitoring app. CBT 
self-help apps might be valuable public mental health interventions for young 
people given their scalability, non-consumable nature, and affordability.

BACKGROUND: Psychiatric inpatients often have limited access to 
psychotherapeutic education or skills for managing anxiety, a common 
transdiagnostic concern in severe and acute mental illness. COVID-19-related 
restrictions further limited access to therapy groups on inpatient psychiatric 
units. App-based interventions may improve access, but evidence supporting the 
feasibility of their use, acceptability, and effectiveness in psychiatric 
inpatient settings is limited. MindShift CBT is a free app based on cognitive 
behavioral therapy principles with evidence for alleviating anxiety symptoms in 
the outpatient setting.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to recruit 24 participants from an acute general psychiatric 
inpatient ward to a 1-month randomized control study assessing the feasibility 
and acceptability of providing patients with severe and acute mental illness 
access to the MindShift CBT app for help with managing anxiety symptoms.
METHODS: Recruitment, data collection, analysis, and interpretation were 
completed collaboratively by clinician and peer researchers. Inpatients were 
randomized to two conditions: treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU plus use of 
the MindShift CBT app over 6 days. We collected demographic and quantitative 
data on acceptability and usability of the intervention. Symptoms of depression, 
anxiety, and psychological distress were measured in pre- and poststudy surveys 
for preliminary signals of efficacy. We conducted individual semistructured 
interviews with participants in the MindShift CBT app group at the end of their 
trial period, which were interpreted using a standardized protocol for thematic 
analysis.
RESULTS: Over 4 weeks, 33 inpatients were referred to the study, 24 consented to 
participate, 20 were randomized, and 11 completed the study. Of the 9 randomized 
participants who did not complete the study, 7 were withdrawn because they were 
discharged or transferred prior to study completion, with a similar distribution 
among both conditions. Among the enrolled patients, 65% (13/20) were admitted 
for a psychotic disorder and no patient was admitted primarily for an anxiety 
disorder. The average length of stay was 20 days (SD 4.4; range 3-21) and 35% 
(7/20) of patients were involuntarily admitted to hospital. Small sample sizes 
limited accurate interpretation of the efficacy data. Themes emerging from 
qualitative interviews included acceptability and usability of the app, and 
patient agency associated with voluntary participation in research while 
admitted to hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study benefitted from collaboration between peer and clinician 
researchers. Due to rapid patient turnover in the acute inpatient setting, 
additional flexibility in recruitment and enrollment is needed to determine the 
efficacy of using app-based psychotherapy on an acute psychiatric ward. Despite 
the limited sample size, our study suggests that similar interventions may be 
feasible and acceptable for acutely unwell inpatients. Further study is needed 
to compare the efficacy of psychotherapeutic apps with existing standards of 
care in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-based products that prevent, 
manage, or treat a medical condition and are delivered through a smartphone app, 
web application, or wearable device. Clinical trials assessing DTx pose 
challenges, foremost among which is designing appropriate digital shams (or 
digital placebos), which should ideally mimic DTx (in terms of design, 
components, and duration of treatment) while omitting the active principle or 
component.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our review was to understand how digital shams are 
being used in clinical research on DTx in neuroscience, which is the most common 
therapy area for DTx.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of DTx in neuroscience 
(including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) 
with a focus on controlled clinical trials involving digital shams. Studies were 
identified from trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the European Union 
Clinical Trials Register, and Trial Trove) and through structured searches in 
MEDLINE and Embase (both via the Embase website) and were limited to articles in 
English published from 2010 onward. These were supplemented by keyword-based 
searches in PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar and bibliographic searches. 
Studies assessing DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, 
neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) were included. Details related to 
the publication, DTx, comparator, patient population, and outcomes were 
extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Our search criteria identified 461 neuroscience studies involving 213 
unique DTx. Most DTx were extended reality based (86/213, 40.4%) or mobile 
device based (56/213, 26.3%); 313 were comparative, of which 68 (21.7%) used 
shams. The most common therapeutic areas assessed in these studies were stroke 
(42/213, 19.7%), depression (32/213, 15%), and anxiety (24/213, 11.3%). The most 
common treatments were cognitive behavioral therapy or behavioral therapy 
(67/213, 32.4%), physical rehabilitation (60/213, 28.2%), and cognitive training 
(41/213, 19.2%). We identified the following important issues related to the use 
of digital shams in neuroscience: shams were not validated before use in 
studies, they varied widely in design (from being nearly identical to the DTx to 
using different software programs altogether), and the level of patient 
engagement or satisfaction with the sham and the impact of the sham on study 
outcomes were infrequently reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital shams are critical for the clinical development of DTx in 
neuroscience. Given the importance of sham controls in evaluating DTx efficacy, 
we provide recommendations on the key information that should be reported in a 
well-designed DTx trial and propose an algorithm to allow the correct 
interpretation of DTx study results. Sham-controlled studies should be routinely 
used in DTx trials-in early-phase studies-to help identify DTx active components 
and-in late-phase studies-to confirm the efficacy of DTx. The use of shams early 
in development will ensure that the appropriate sham control is used in later 
confirmatory trials.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of computer-assisted forms of 
cognitive-behavior therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine the 
role of clinician support and other factors that might affect outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus from their beginnings 
to July 18, 2016. Keywords were "randomized, controlled trials of 
computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy for depression" and "randomized, 
controlled trials of mobile apps for cognitive-behavior therapy of depression."
STUDY SELECTION: Of 223 studies identified in the search, 183 were excluded 
yielding a sample of 40 randomized, controlled investigations of 
computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy (CCBT) for depression.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted independently by two authors, and 
consensus was reached by discussion with a third author.
RESULTS: The overall mean effect size for CCBT compared to control conditions 
was g = 0.502, a moderately large effect. Studies that provided support from a 
clinician or other person yielded significantly larger effects (g = 0.673) than 
studies in which no support was provided (g = 0.239). Completion rate and study 
setting also influenced outcomes. Lower mean effect sizes were observed in 
studies with lower completion rates and in studies conducted in primary care 
practices.
CONCLUSIONS: CCBT with a modest amount of support from a clinician or other 
helping person was found to be efficacious with relatively large mean effect 
sizes on measures of depressive symptoms. Self-guided CCBT for depression was 
considerably less effective. Future research should focus on enhancing the 
implementation of CCBT, including evaluating the amount and type of support 
needed for effective delivery, methods to improve engagement with 
computer-assisted therapies, and ways to improve treatment outcome in primary 
care settings.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder affects approximately 1 in 5 adults during 
their lifetime and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Yet, a minority 
receive adequate treatment due to person-level (eg, geographical distance to 
providers) and systems-level (eg, shortage of trained providers) barriers. 
Digital tools could improve this treatment gap by reducing the time and 
frequency of therapy sessions needed for effective treatment through the 
provision of flexible, automated support.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary clinical effect of Mindset for Depression, a deployment-ready 8-week 
smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) supported by brief 
teletherapy appointments with a therapist.
METHODS: This 8-week, single-arm open trial tested the Mindset for Depression 
app when combined with 8 brief (16-25 minutes) video conferencing visits with a 
licensed doctoral-level CBT therapist (n=28 participants). The app offers 
flexible, accessible psychoeducation, CBT skills practice, and support to 
patients as well as clinician guidance to promote sustained engagement, monitor 
safety, and tailor treatment to individual patient needs. To increase 
accessibility and thus generalizability, all study procedures were conducted 
remotely. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed via attrition, patient 
expectations and feedback, and treatment utilization. The primary clinical 
outcome measure was the clinician-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 
administered at pretreatment, midpoint, and posttreatment. Secondary measures of 
functional impairment and quality of life as well as maintenance of gains 
(3-month follow-up) were also collected.
RESULTS: Treatment credibility (week 4), expectancy (week 4), and satisfaction 
(week 8) were moderate to high, and attrition was low (n=2, 7%). Participants 
self-reported using the app or practicing (either on or off the app) the CBT 
skills taught in the app for a median of 50 (IQR 30-60; week 4) or 60 (IQR 
30-90; week 8) minutes per week; participants accessed the app on an average 
36.8 (SD 10.0) days and completed a median of 7 of 8 (IQR 6-8) steps by the week 
8 assessment. The app was rated positively across domains of engagement, 
functionality, aesthetics, and information. Participants' depression severity 
scores decreased from an average Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score 
indicating moderate depression (mean 19.1, SD 5.0) at baseline to a week 8 mean 
score indicating mild depression (mean 10.8, SD 6.1; d=1.47; P<.001). 
Improvement was also observed for functional impairment and quality of life. 
Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that Mindset for Depression is a feasible and 
acceptable treatment option for individuals with major depressive disorder. This 
smartphone-led treatment holds promise to be an efficacious, scalable, and 
cost-effective treatment option. The next steps include testing Mindset for 
Depression in a fully powered randomized controlled trial and real-world 
clinical settings.

Digital intervention has been shown to be helpful in improving perinatal mental 
health. However, the design characteristics of such interventions have not been 
systematically reviewed. Considering that a lack of support-especially from a 
partner-is one of the major contributing factors to perinatal depression and 
anxiety, it is crucial to determine whether digital interventions have included 
partner participation. In this review, we systematically examined the design 
characteristics of digital interventions related to perinatal depression and 
anxiety and aimed to determine whether partner participation was incorporated as 
part of the interventions. Based on the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, five databases 
(PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane, ProQuest, and Scopus) were searched. Narrative results 
of design characteristics were developed to provide a framework for the design 
and evaluation of the studies. A total of 12 intervention studies from China, 
Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Norway, and the United Kingdom were 
included. Across all studies, internet cognitive behavioral therapy and 
mindfulness therapy were overwhelmingly utilized as the major intervention 
approaches. While all studies reported reduced depressive symptoms after the 
intervention, only four studies reported subsequent decreased levels of both 
depressive and anxiety symptoms. Only one study included partner support in the 
intervention. Cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness therapy, two of the 
most common intervention approaches, were found to be effective in alleviating 
perinatal depression and anxiety. Partner participation should be prioritized in 
designing digital interventions to ensure comprehensive and easily accessible 
social support for persons in need.

BACKGROUND: Cancer caregivers extend comprehensive support covering all aspects 
of patients' daily lives. It has been reported that a significant proportion of 
cancer caregivers experience emotional distress. As one way to solve this 
problem, third-wave cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), which involves 
integrating acceptance and mindfulness into cognitive‒behavioral therapy, has 
been applied to improve caregiver outcomes.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on the scoping review guidelines 
proposed by the Jonna Briggs Institute (JBI). The population was caregivers of 
cancer patients, the concept was third-wave CBT, and the context remained open. 
English and Korean publications published from 2001 to June 2022 were identified 
from PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Korea Med, and RISS.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were included in this scoping review. 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
(ACT) was the most frequently applied intervention (n = 3, each). Among the 
components of third-wave CBT, 'mindfulness' was identified in all the studies 
reviewed (n = 12). Dyadic interventions comprised the majority (n = 9). 
Interventions using digital technologies such as mobile application/web page 
(n = 3), telephone (n = 3), and FaceTime (n = 2) have increased since 2017. 
Depression was the most frequently evaluated outcome (n = 8), followed by 
anxiety and mindfulness (n = 6, each).
CONCLUSIONS: The current review explored available third-wave CBT intervention 
studies for cancer caregivers and targeted outcomes. Most of the interventions 
were dyadic interventions and utilized mindfulness. Delivery methods were 
continuously updated with digital technologies. Further RCTs with robust 
research designs and a synthesis of the results of the trials would provide 
evidence about how to effectively apply third-wave CBTs for cancer caregivers.

Objective: The contribution of components in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to 
the total reduction of depression symptoms has not been well elucidated, and 
previous studies couldn't exclude the human factors in the therapy. Design: This 
is a secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial comparing automated 
smartphone CBT without human factors plus antidepressant switch against 
antidepressant switch alone among patients with antidepressant-resistant 
depression. The present CBT consisted of self-monitoring, behavioral activation, 
and cognitive restructuring. We used linear regression to predict the overall 
pre- to post-symptom improvement based on improvement achieved by sessions 
teaching each cognitive or behavioral skill. The overall improvement was 
measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the session-to-session 
improvement with K6. Results: Of the 164 participants originally enrolled in the 
study, 94 participants who completed all K6 evaluation were included in the 
primary analyses. The results indicated that K6 score reduction in the first 
half of behavioral activation significantly predicted BDI-II score reduction. 
The sensitivity analysis including 162 participants did not change the result. 
K6 score reductions after other CBT sessions did not significantly predict 
BDI-II score reduction. Conclusion: The behavioral activation seems to 
contribute to the total reduction of depressive symptoms even if human factors 
are excluded by using automated smartphone CBT.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common worldwide and can be 
highly disabling. People with MDD face many barriers to treatment and may not 
experience full symptom relief even when treated. Therefore, new treatment 
modalities are needed for MDD. Digital therapeutics (DTx) may provide people 
with MDD an additional treatment option.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe a phase 3 remote, multicenter, 
randomized, masked, sham-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a 
smartphone app-based DTx (CT-152) in adult participants diagnosed with MDD, used 
as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy (ADT).
METHODS: Participants aged 22-64 years with a current primary diagnosis of MDD 
and an inadequate response to ADT were included. Participants were randomized 
1:1 to CT-152 or a sham DTx. CT-152 is a smartphone app-based DTx that delivers 
a cognitive-emotional and behavioral therapeutic intervention. The core 
components of CT-152 are the Emotional Faces Memory Task exercises, brief 
lessons to learn and apply key therapeutic skills, and SMS text messaging to 
reinforce lessons and encourage engagement with the app. The sham DTx is a 
digital working memory exercise with emotionally neutral stimuli designed to 
match CT-152 for time and attention. Participants took part in the trial for up 
to 13 weeks. The trial included a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment 
period of 6 weeks, and an extension period of 4 weeks to assess the durability 
of the effect. Sites and participants had the option of an in-person or remote 
screening visit; the remaining trial visits were remote. Efficacy was evaluated 
using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder-7, Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale, the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment 
Schedule 2.0. The durability of the effect was evaluated with the 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
scale. Adverse events were also assessed. Satisfaction, measured by the 
Participant and Healthcare Professional Satisfaction Scales, and health status, 
measured by the EQ-5D-5L, were summarized using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: This study was initiated in February 2021 and had a primary completion 
date in October 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This represents the methodological design for the first evaluation 
of CT-152 as an adjunct to ADT. This study protocol is methodologically robust 
and incorporates many aspects of conventional pivotal pharmaceutical phase 3 
trial design, such as randomization and safety end points. Novel considerations 
included the use of a sham comparator, masking considerations for visible app 
content, and outcome measures relevant to DTx. The rigor of this methodology 
will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of CT-152.

BACKGROUND: There is need for more cost and time effective treatments for 
depression. This is the first randomised controlled trial in which a blended 
treatment--including four face-to-face sessions and a smartphone 
application--was compared against a full behavioural treatment. Hence, the aim 
of the current paper was to examine whether a blended smartphone treatment was 
non-inferior to a full behavioural activation treatment for depression.
METHODS: This was a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial (NCT01819025) 
comparing a blended treatment (n=46) against a full ten-session treatment (n=47) 
for people suffering from major depression. Primary outcome measure was the 
BDI-II, that was administered at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six months 
after the treatment.
RESULTS: Results showed significant improvements in both groups across time on 
the primary outcome measure (within-group Cohen's d=1.35; CI [-0.82, 3.52] to 
d=1.47; CI [-0.41, 3.35]; between group d=-0.13 CI [-2.37, 2.09] and d=-0.10 CI 
[-2.53, 2.33]). At the same time, the blended treatment reduced the therapist 
time with an average of 47%.
CONCLUSIONS: We could not establish whether the blended treatment was 
non-inferior to a full BA treatment. Nevertheless, this study points to that the 
blended treatment approach could possibly treat nearly twice as many patients 
suffering from depression by using a smartphone application as add-on. More 
studies are needed before we can suggest that the blended treatment method is a 
promising cost-effective alternative to regular face-to-face treatment for 
depression.

It has been reported that a scenario-based cognitive behavioral therapy mobile 
app including Todac Todac was effective in improving depression in the general 
public. However, no study has been conducted on whether Todac Todac is effective 
in dialysis patients. Therefore, this study was intended to determine whether 
the use of this app was effective in improving depression in dialysis patients. 
Sixty-five end-stage kidney disease patients receiving dialysis at Soonchunhyang 
University Cheonan Hospital were randomly assigned to the Todac Todac app 
program (experimental group) or an E-moods daily mood chart app program (control 
group) for 3 weeks. The degree of depression was measured before and after using 
the app.After the end of the 3-week program, a small but significant improvement 
was observed in the Trait anxiety (p < 0.05) and Beck depression index 
(p < 0.05) in E-moods group and DAS-K scores (p < 0.05) in Todac Todac group. 
However, no differences were seen in any parameters between the two groups. In 
addition, Todac Todac was not statistically more effective than the control 
intervention in the subgroup analysis. The Todac Todac, a scenario-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy mobile app, seemed to have a limited effect on 
improving depression in dialysis patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop 
new tools to improve depression in dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: As digital interventions gain prominence in mental health care, they 
present opportunities to improve access and scalability. Despite their 
potential, the overall impact of digital behavioral activation (BA) 
interventions across different formats and populations is not yet fully 
understood.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review examines the characteristics and functions of 
digital BA interventions and evaluates their effectiveness for mental health and 
other patient-related outcomes.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, 
APA PsycInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov) was performed in November 2023 to identify 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of digital BA 
interventions for depression and anxiety. A total of 2 reviewers screened the 
studies for inclusion. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model assessed 
intervention impact on outcomes including depression, anxiety, quality of life 
(QoL), BA scores, functioning and disability, and stress. Statistical 
heterogeneity was evaluated with the I² statistic and statistical significance 
was evaluated with P values. Studies that did not meet the meta-analysis 
criteria underwent narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: A total of 18 articles reporting 17 RCTs were included across three 
intervention types: (1) internet-based BA (n=12, 71%), delivering digital 
therapies to foster new behavioral activities for depression management; (2) 
electronic messaging-based BA (n=2, 12%), involving prompts to support behavior 
change; and (3) telehealth-based BA (n=3, 17%), providing remote health care 
services. We identified single-component and multicomponent interventions that 
combined BA with elements such as problem-solving therapy or cognitive 
behavioral therapy. A total of 12 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, while 
the remaining studies were narratively synthesized. Risk of bias (RoB) was 
assessed in all included studies. Digital BA interventions significantly reduced 
depressive symptoms at 2 months (P<.001, I²=0%), 3 months (P=.001, I²=51%), and 
6 months (P=.009, I²=29%) post treatment, but not at 12 months (P=.82, I²=89%). 
Significant improvements in BA scores at 6 months were observed (P<.001, I²=0%). 
QoL improved significantly at 3 months (P=.002, I²=22%) and 6 months (P=.009, 
I²=0%). Stress levels were also significantly reduced at 3 months (P<.001, 
I²=25%). However, no significant changes were identified in anxiety and 
functioning and disability outcomes at either 3 months (anxiety: P=.08, I²=68%) 
or 6 months (anxiety: P=.24, I²=44%; functioning and disability: P=.88, I²=90%). 
Across included studies, RoB was generally low, particularly for random sequence 
generation and allocation concealment.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital BA interventions are effective in reducing depressive 
symptoms and improving QoL in the short- to midterm. However, these effects tend 
to diminish over time with no sustained benefits observed at 12 months. Future 
research should focus on developing and testing interventions with greater 
long-term efficacy, clarifying the role of BA within multicomponent digital 
approaches, and identifying the optimal intervention "dose" needed to maintain 
lasting effects.

BACKGROUND: Adolescence and early adulthood are pivotal stages for the onset of 
mental health disorders and the development of health behaviors. Digital 
behavioral activation interventions, with or without coaching support, hold 
promise for addressing risk factors for both mental and physical health problems 
by offering scalable approaches to expand access to evidence-based mental health 
support.
OBJECTIVE: This 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated 2 versions of 
a digital behavioral health product, Vira (Ksana Health Inc), for their 
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness in improving mental 
health in young adults with depressive symptoms and obesity risk factors.
METHODS: A total of 73 participants recruited throughout the United States were 
randomly assigned to use Vira either as a self-guided product (Vira Self-Care) 
or with support from a health coach (Vira+Coaching) for 12 weeks. The Vira 
smartphone app used passive sensing of behavioral data related to mental health 
and obesity risk factors (ie, activity, sleep, mobility, and language patterns) 
and offered users personalized insights into patterns of behavior associated 
with their daily mood. Participants completed self-reported outcome measures at 
baseline and follow-up (12 weeks). All study procedures were completed via 
digital communications.
RESULTS: Both versions of Vira showed strong user engagement, acceptability, and 
evidence of effectiveness in improving mental health and stress. However, users 
receiving coaching exhibited more sustained engagement with the platform and 
reported greater reductions in depression (Cohen d=0.45, 95% CI 0.10-0.82) and 
anxiety (Cohen d=0.50, 95% CI 0.13-0.86) compared to self-care users. Both 
interventions also resulted in reduced stress (Vira+Coaching: Cohen d=-1.05, 95% 
CI -1.57 to --0.50; Vira Self-Care: Cohen d=-0.78, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.23) and 
were perceived as useful and easy to use. Coached users also reported reductions 
in sleep-related impairment (Cohen d=-0.51, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.01). Moreover, 
participants increased their motivation for and confidence in making behavioral 
changes, with greater improvements in confidence among coached users.
CONCLUSIONS: An app-based intervention using passive mobile sensing to track 
behavior and deliver personalized insights into behavior-mood associations 
demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness for 
reducing depressive symptoms and other mental health problems in young adults. 
Future directions include (1) optimizing the interventions, (2) conducting a 
fully powered trial that includes an active control condition, and (3) testing 
mediators and moderators of outcome effects.

BACKGROUND: Depression during pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a 
worldwide public health problem. If untreated, there can be detrimental outcomes 
for the mother and child. Anxiety is also often comorbid with depression. 
Although effective treatments exist, most women do not receive treatment. 
Technology is a mechanism to increase access to and engagement in mental health 
services.
OBJECTIVE: The Guardians is a mobile app, grounded in behavioral activation 
principles, which seeks to leverage mobile game mechanics and in-game rewards to 
encourage user engagement. This study seeks to assess app satisfaction and 
engagement and to explore changes in clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety 
among a sample of pregnant women with elevated depressive symptoms.
METHODS: This multimethod pilot test consisted of a single-arm, proof-of-concept 
trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of The Guardians among a 
pregnant sample with depression (N=18). Participation included two web-based 
study visits: (1) a baseline assessment to collect demographic and obstetric 
information and to assess clinical symptoms and (2) an exit interview to 
administer follow-up measures and explore user experience. Participants 
completed biweekly questionnaires (ie, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) during the trial to assess depression and 
anxiety symptom severity. App satisfaction was measured using 2 self-report 
scales (ie, Mobile Application Rating Scale and Player Experience of Needs 
Satisfaction scale). Engagement with The Guardians was captured using game 
interaction metric data. We used backward-eliminated mixed effects longitudinal 
models to examine the effects of app engagement and satisfaction and length of 
time in the study on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Content analysis was 
conducted on qualitative data from exit interviews.
RESULTS: The 15-day and 30-day overall app retention rates were 26.6% and 15.1%, 
respectively. Mixed effects models found significant negative main effects of 
week in study (β=-.35; t61=-3.05; P=.003), number of activities completed 
(β=-.12; t61=-2.05; P=.04), days played (β=-.12; t58=-2.9; P=.005), and 
satisfaction, according to the Mobile Application Rating Scale (β=-3.05; 
t45=-2.19; P=.03) on depressive symptoms. We have reported about similar 
analyses for anxiety. There is preliminary evidence suggesting harder activities 
are associated with greater mood improvement than easier activities. Qualitative 
content analysis resulted in feedback falling under the following themes: 
activities, app design, engagement, fit of the app with lifestyle, perceived 
impact of the app on mood, and suggestions for app modifications.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results from this multimethod study of The Guardians 
indicate feasibility and acceptability among pregnant women with depression. 
Retention and engagement levels were more than double those of previous public 
mental health apps, and use of the app was associated with significant decrease 
in depressive symptom scores over the 10-week trial. The Guardians shows promise 
as an effective and scalable digital intervention to support women experiencing 
depression.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents face unprecedented mental health challenges, and 
technology has the opportunity to facilitate access and support digitally 
connected generations. The combination of digital tools and live human 
connection may hold particular promise for resonating with and flexibly 
supporting young people's mental health.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the BeMe app-based platform to support 
adolescents' mental health and well-being and to examine app engagement, 
usability, and satisfaction.
METHODS: Adolescents in the United States, aged 13 to 20 years, were recruited 
via the web and enrolled between September 1 and October 31, 2022. App 
engagement, feature use, clinical functioning, and satisfaction with BeMe were 
examined for 30 days. BeMe provides content based on cognitive behavioral 
therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, motivational interviewing, and positive 
psychology; interactive activities; live text-based coaching; links to clinical 
services; and crisis support tools (digital and live).
RESULTS: The average age of the sample (N=13,421) was 15.04 (SD 1.7) years, and 
56.72% (7612/13,421) identified with she/her pronouns. For the subsample that 
completed the in-app assessments, the mean scores indicated concern for 
depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire mean 15.68/20, SD 5.9; n=239), 
anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire mean 13.37/17, SD 
5.0; n=791), and poor well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-being 
Index mean 30.15/100, SD 16.1; n=1923). Overall, the adolescents engaged with 
BeMe for an average of 2.38 (SD 2.7) days in 7.94 (SD 24.1) sessions and 
completed 11.26 (SD 19.8) activities. Most adolescents engaged with BeMe's 
content (12,270/13,421, 91.42%), mood ratings (13,094/13,421, 97.56%), and 
interactive skills (10,098/13,421, 75.24%), and almost one-fifth of the 
adolescents engaged with coaching (2539/13,421, 18.92%), clinical resources 
(2411/13,421, 17.96%), and crisis support resources (2499/13,421, 18.62%). 
Overall app engagement (total activities) was highest among female and 
gender-neutral adolescents compared with male adolescents (all P<.001) and was 
highest among younger adolescents (aged 13-14 years) compared with all other 
ages (all P<.001). Satisfaction ratings were generally high for content (eg, 
158/176, 89.8% rated as helpful and 1044/1139, 91.66% improved coping 
self-efficacy), activities (5362/8468, 63.32% helpful and 4408/6072, 72.6% 
useful in coping with big feelings), and coaching (747/894, 83.6% helpful and 
747/894, 83.6% improved coping self-efficacy). Engagement (total activities 
completed) predicted the likelihood of app satisfaction (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents downloaded the BeMe app and completed multiple 
sessions and activities. Engagement with BeMe was higher among female and 
younger adolescents. Ratings of BeMe's content, activities, and coaching were 
very positive for cognitive precursors aimed at reducing depression and anxiety 
and improving well-being. The findings will inform future app development to 
promote more sustained engagement, and future evaluations will assess the 
effects of BeMe on changes in mental health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) may offer scalable 
treatment for common mental health conditions. However, many commercially 
available apps have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation of effectiveness, 
particularly among users experiencing clinically significant symptomatology. We 
examined depression and anxiety symptom outcomes associated with a top-rated, 
commercially available self-guided DMHI based on cognitive behavioral therapy 
("Sanvello") relative to waitlist control.
METHODS: This preregistered web-based, 2-arm, parallel-group randomized trial 
enrolled U.S. adults with self-reported elevated symptoms of depression and/or 
anxiety. Those assigned to the treatment condition were provided 8 weeks of 
access to Sanvello. Co-primary outcomes of depression (Patient Health 
Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale 
[GAD-7]) severity were assessed at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses included 280 participants (mean age 
32.47 ± 9.32 years; 86.1 % women). Generalized linear mixed models showed a 
significant improvement in depression (F(4,779) = 6.51, p < .001) and anxiety 
(F(4,907) = 3.28, p = .01) associated with the DMHI over time. The intervention 
was also associated with a greater proportion of participants exhibiting 
depression response (25 [45.5 %] vs 26 [16.9 %]) and remission (10 [18.2 %] vs 7 
[4.5 %]) on the PHQ-9, and anxiety response (31 [44.9 %] vs 39 [22.8 %]) and 
remission (20 [29.0 %] vs 27 [15.8 %]) on the GAD-7, relative to waitlist.
LIMITATIONS: Findings may not represent people with serious mental illness, 
suicidality, or the broader population of DMHI users.
CONCLUSIONS: A commercially available, self-guided DMHI was effective at 
improving symptoms in individuals experiencing depression or anxiety.

IMPORTANCE: There is a substantial gap between demand for and availability of 
mental health services. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are 
promising tools for bridging this gap, yet little is known about their 
comparative effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients randomized to a cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT)-based or mindfulness-based DMHI had greater improvements in mental 
health symptoms than patients randomized to the enhanced personalized feedback 
(EPF)-only DMHI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted 
between May 13, 2020, and December 12, 2022, with follow-up at 6 weeks. Adult 
patients of outpatient psychiatry services across various clinics within the 
University of Michigan Health System with a scheduled or recent outpatient 
psychiatry appointment were recruited. Eligible patients were randomized to an 
intervention arm. All analyses followed the intent-to-treat principle.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 intervention arms: (1) EPF 
only; (2) Silvercloud only, a mobile application designed to deliver CBT 
strategies; (3) Silvercloud plus EPF; (4) Headspace only, a mobile application 
designed to train users in mindfulness practices; and (5) Headspace plus EPF.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in depressive 
symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; score range: 
0-27, with higher scores indicating greater depression symptoms). Secondary 
outcomes included changes in anxiety, suicidality, and substance use symptoms.
RESULTS: A total of 2079 participants (mean [SD] age, 36.8 [14.3] years; 1423 
self-identified as women [68.4%]) completed the baseline survey. The baseline 
mean (SD) PHQ-9 score was 12.7 (6.4) and significantly decreased for all 5 
intervention arms at 6 weeks (from -2.1 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.7] to -2.9 [95% CI, 
-3.4 to -2.4]; n = 1885). The magnitude of change was not significantly 
different across the 5 arms (F4,1879 = 1.19; P = .31). Additionally, the groups 
did not differ in decrease in anxiety or substance use symptoms. However, the 
Headspace arms reported significantly greater improvements on a suicidality 
measure subscale compared with the Silvercloud arms (mean difference in mean 
change = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.20-1.06; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found decreases in 
depression and anxiety symptoms across all DMHIs and minimal evidence that 
specific applications were better than others. The findings suggest that DMHIs 
may provide support for patients during waiting list-related delays in care.

BACKGROUND: Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD) is a common 
psychological disorder. Internet-based interventions have the potential to offer 
highly scalable low-threshold evidence-based care to people suffering from PD. 
GET.ON Panic is a newly developed internet-based intervention addressing 
symptoms of PD. In order to transfer the training into the daily life of the 
individuals, we integrated mobile components in the training and created a 
so-called hybrid online training. The development and beta-testing of such a 
training requires a novel interdisciplinary approach between IT specialists and 
psychologists. From this point of view, we would like to share our experiences 
in this exploratory paper.
METHODS: This initial feasibility study (N = 10) offers, on the one hand, a 
brief overview of the interdisciplinary development phase of the mobile 
application and on the other hand, provides first insights into the usage, 
usability and acceptance of this mobile application using qualitative interview 
data as well quantitative measures of 8 completing participants. For these 
reasons, we used a pre-posttest design without a control group. Furthermore, we 
present initial clinical outcomes of the intervention on e.g. panic symptom 
severity, depressive symptoms as well additional anxiety measures. Finally, we 
end with implications for further research in the relatively new field of mobile 
mental health.
RESULTS: Overall, usability, user satisfaction, motivational value and 
technology acceptance of the app were perceived as high. The usage of app 
components was diverse: The use of interoceptive exposure exercises and daily 
summaries on anxiety and mood was highest while using in-vivo exposure exercises 
and monitoring panic symptoms was perceived as difficult. Furthermore, 
participants showed after the training less clinical symptoms as at 
baseline-assessment.
DISCUSSION: The current feasibility study contributes to an in-depth 
understanding of the potential of mobile technology in e-mental health. Overall, 
the GET.ON Panic app appears to be an acceptable and motivational part of a 
CBT-based hybrid online training for PD that has the potential to promote 
training success. After some suggested adjustments have been made, the efficacy 
should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial.

A large number of individuals experience mental health disorders, with cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) emerging as a standard practice for reduction in 
psychiatric symptoms, including stress, anger, anxiety, and depression. However, 
CBT is associated with significant patient dropout and lacks the means to 
provide objective data regarding a patient's experience and symptoms between 
sessions. Emerging wearables and mobile health (mHealth) applications represent 
an approach that may provide objective data to the patient and provider between 
CBT sessions. Here, we describe the development of a classifier of real-time 
physiological stress in a healthy population (n = 35) and apply it in a 
controlled clinical evaluation for armed forces veterans undergoing CBT for 
stress and anger management (n = 16). Using cardiovascular and electrodermal 
inputs from a wearable device, the classifier was able to detect physiological 
stress in a non-clinical sample with accuracy greater than 90%. In a small 
clinical sample, patients who used the classifier and an associated mHealth 
application were less likely to discontinue therapy (p = 0.016, d = 1.34) and 
significantly improved on measures of stress (p = 0.032, d = 1.61), anxiety 
(p = 0.050, d = 1.26), and anger (p = 0.046, d = 1.41) compared to controls 
undergoing CBT alone. Given the large number of individuals that experience 
mental health disorders and the unmet need for treatment, especially in 
developing nations, such mHealth approaches have the potential to provide or 
augment treatment at low cost in the absence of in-person care.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic insomnia is a substantial public health burden that often 
presents with co-occurring depression and anxiety. Randomized clinical trials 
and preliminary real-world evidence have shown that digitally delivered 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is associated with 
improvements in insomnia, but real-world evidence is needed to determine the 
true impact of digital CBT-I. This pragmatic study aimed to evaluate the 
benefits of treating chronic insomnia with a tailored prescription digital 
therapeutic in a real-world population.
METHODS: This prospective, single-arm clinical study involved adults aged 22-75 
with chronic insomnia living in the US who had access to a mobile device. 
Participants accessed the FDA-cleared prescription digital therapeutic (PDT; 
Somryst®) over a 9-week intervention period. The PDT delivers 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia via six interactive treatment cores 
and daily sleep diaries used for tailoring treatment. Participants completed 
validated patient-reported instruments at baseline, before completing treatment 
cores, immediately post-intervention, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. The 
Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8], 
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7] were used to determine the 
effect of the PDT on insomnia, depression, and anxiety.
RESULTS: After screening, 1565 adults accessed the PDT. 58% of those who began 
the program completed Core 4, established as exposure to all mechanisms of 
action in the digital therapeutic. For those who completed assessments for all 6 
cores (48.4%), the ISI was lowered from 18.8 to a mean of 9.9 (P <.001). These 
scores continued to be lower than baseline at immediate post (11.0), 6-month 
(11.6), and 1-year follow-ups (12.2) (P <.001). The results of the PHQ-8 and 
GAD-7 also show significant decreases at all measured timepoints from baseline 
(P <.001). Of the patients that began the program, 908 (58.0%) were considered 
adherent and 733 (46.8%) completed all 6 cores.
CONCLUSION: Data from the DREAM study contributes to the growing body of 
clinical evidence of how patients are utilizing a PDT in the real world, outside 
of controlled settings, offering insights for clinicians who use these 
therapeutics in practice.

INTRODUCTION: Traditional cognitive behavioral interventions (CBIs) improve mood 
and gastrointestinal symptom severity in patients with functional 
gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) but face substantial barriers to 
implementation. Integrating behavioral health technology into medical clinic 
workflows could overcome these barriers. We evaluated the feasibility and impact 
of a coached digital CBI (dCBI) as a first-line intervention in a prospective 
cohort of emotionally distressed patients with FGID.
METHODS: Patients with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms were offered a dCBI 
(an app called RxWell) during routine clinic visits. RxWell provides cognitive 
behavioral techniques enhanced by within-app text messaging with a health coach. 
Both gastroenterology and behavioral health-care providers electronically 
prescribed RxWell. We tracked patient interactions with RxWell, and patients 
completed anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (Personal Health 
Questionniare Depression Scale) measures through the app. Our primary study 
outcome was the change in General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Personal Health 
Questionniare Depression Scale scores.
RESULTS: Of 364 patients with FGID (mean age 43 years [SD 16 years]; 73.1% 
women) prescribed the dCBI, 48.4% enrolled (median use, 3 techniques 
[interquartile range 1-14]). About half of RxWell enrollees communicated with 
health coaches. The mean baseline anxiety score was 11.4 (SD 5.5), and the 
depression score was 11.5 (SD 6.1). RxWell users experienced improvements in 
anxiety (mean change 2.71 [t = 3.7, df = 58; P < 0.001]) and depression (mean 
change 2.9 [t = 4.2, df = 45; P < 0.001]) at 4 months.
DISCUSSION: Patients with FGIDs and moderately severe anxiety and depressive 
symptoms are willing to use dCBI tools recommended by their providers. Our pilot 
data demonstrate that dCBI usage is associated with clinically and statistically 
significant mood symptom reductions.

A surge in the development of computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CCBT) and mobile apps for depression has provided many tools with potential for 
enhancing treatment delivery. This article assesses progress in evaluation and 
implementation of CCBT and mobile apps for depression, with a focus on providing 
practical information on clinical applications. Advantage and disadvantages of 
these technologies are identified, outcome research is reviewed, and 
recommendations are made for clinical use. With increasing use of computer 
technology in everyday life, it is likely that clinicians and patients will 
pursue opportunities to employ computer tools in treatment for depression.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a commonly occurring disorder linked to diminished 
role functioning and quality of life. The development of treatments that 
overcome barriers to accessing treatment remains an important area of clinical 
research as most people delay or do not receive treatment at an appropriate 
time. The workplace is an ideal setting to roll-out an intervention, 
particularly given the substantial psychological benefits associated with 
remaining in the workforce. Mobile health (mhealth) interventions utilising 
smartphone applications (apps) offer novel solutions to disseminating evidence 
based programs, however few apps have undergone rigorous testing. The present 
study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app designed to treat 
depressive symptoms in workers.
METHODS: The present study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), 
comparing the effectiveness of the intervention to that of an attention control. 
The primary outcome measured will be reduced depressive symptoms at 3 months. 
Secondary outcomes such as wellbeing and work performance will also be measured. 
Employees from a range of industries will be recruited via a mixture of targeted 
social media advertising and Industry partners. Participants will be included if 
they present with likely current depression at baseline. Following baseline 
assessment (administered within the app), participants will be randomised to 
receive one of two versions of the Headgear application: 1) Intervention (a 
30-day mental health intervention focusing on behavioural activation and 
mindfulness), or 2) attention control app (mood monitoring for 30 days). 
Participants will be blinded to their allocation. Analyses will be conducted 
within an intention to treat framework using mixed modelling.
DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide valuable information about 
the effectiveness of mhealth interventions in the treatment of depressive 
symptoms in a workplace context.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The current trial is registered with the Australian and New 
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12617000547347 , Registration date:

Existing research has identified an increased risk of depression among autistic 
adults, which can negatively impact their adaptive functioning abilities and 
socioeconomic outcomes. Mobile app-based meditation is a feasible, accessible, 
and effective self-care solution for depression among neurotypical adults, but 
there is limited evidence for the long-term benefits of app-based meditation 
among autistic adults. Habits are a key behavioral strategy for maintaining 
behavior change, and anchoring is one effective habit formation intervention 
that has yet to be tested among autistic adults. This study demonstrates that it 
is both feasible and effective to integrate the anchoring habit formation 
strategy into an app-based meditation intervention for establishing meditation 
habits among autistic adults. In addition, the study shows that app-based 
meditation habits were successful at maintaining reductions in depressive 
symptoms over 6 months. These results demonstrate the power of anchoring-based 
habit formation interventions for establishing healthy habits among autistic 
adults, which offers a promising behavioral intervention technique for 
establishing other healthy habits among autistic adults. The study also shows 
that app-based meditation habits are an effective long-term self-care solution 
for managing depressive symptoms among autistic adults that should be used by 
mental health providers and policymakers. Future research should test this 
combined anchoring and app-based meditation intervention technique among larger 
samples of autistic adults and over longer durations to better understand the 
mechanisms underlying the success of this intervention.

BACKGROUND: Digital interventions present potential solutions for aftercare and 
relapse prevention in anxiety and depressive disorders. This systematic review 
synthesizes evidence on the efficacy of internet- and mobile-based interventions 
for post-acute care in these conditions.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases (MEDLINE, 
CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycEXTRA, ProQuest 
Dissertations and Theses Open, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and Open 
Grey) for randomized controlled trials evaluating digital aftercare or relapse 
prevention interventions for adults with anxiety or depressive disorders. 
Primary outcomes included symptom severity, relapse rates, recurrence rates, and 
rehospitalization. Secondary outcomes included general quality of life and 
adherence to primary treatment. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane 
tool.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies (3,206 participants) met the inclusion criteria. 
Interventions included cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based 
approaches, and supportive text messaging. Most studies focused on depression, 
with limited evidence for anxiety disorders. Notably, fourteen studies that 
reported on depressive symptoms demonstrated significant improvements following 
digital interventions, with effect sizes ranging from small (Cohen's d = 0.20) 
to large (Cohen's d = 0.80). Five studies investigated relapse or recurrence 
rates, yielding mixed results. Adherence rates varied significantly across 
studies, ranging from 50 to 92.3%, highlighting the variability in participant 
engagement. Methodological quality was also variable, with allocation 
concealment and blinding being common limitations.
CONCLUSION: Internet- and mobile-based interventions show promise for aftercare 
and relapse prevention in depression, with limited evidence for anxiety 
disorders. Future research should focus on optimizing engagement, personalizing 
interventions, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting larger trials with 
longer follow-up periods. These findings have important implications for 
integrating digital tools into existing care pathways to improve long-term 
outcomes for individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders.

BACKGROUND: Chile has a high prevalence of postpartum depression and a 
significant treatment gap. Some barriers to postpartum depression care uncover 
the need for more easily accessible and lower-cost interventions. Chile's high 
utilization of digital technologies across all social strata and the increased 
use of pregnancy and parenting apps open the possibility of delivering 
interventions through mobile devices. Cognitive-behavioral internet-based 
interventions have proven to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in 
high-income countries. However, in Chile, this is an underdeveloped field. This 
manuscript describes a randomized controlled trial protocol that will examine 
the feasibility and acceptability of a guided 8-week cognitive-behavioral 
app-based intervention for Chilean postpartum women with depressive symptoms.
METHOD: A small-scale parallel 2-arms trial will be conducted. Postpartum women 
with minor or major depression will be randomized to the app-based intervention 
or waitlist. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability variables, 
mainly; recruitment and eligibility rates, intervention and study adherence, and 
participants' intervention satisfaction, use, and engagement. Semi-structured 
interviews with a sub-sample will provide more information about the 
participants' experience with the intervention. Women's depression status will 
be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Other 
secondary outcomes will include participants' perceived social support, 
mother-infant bonding, and maternal satisfaction and self-efficacy.
DISCUSSION: This will be the first internet-based intervention aimed at reducing 
postpartum depression symptoms developed and studied in Chile. If the 
intervention and procedures prove feasible and acceptable, we plan to study its 
efficacy in a definitive controlled trial. If the intervention demonstrates to 
be effective, the aim is to implement it within the Chilean healthcare setting.

BACKGROUND: Digital technology has influenced many aspects of modern living, 
including health care. In the context of elective surgeries, there is a strong 
association between preoperative physical and psychological preparedness, and 
improved postoperative outcomes. Health behavior changes made in the pre- and 
postoperative periods can be fundamental in determining the outcomes and success 
of elective surgeries. Understanding the potential unmet needs of patients 
undergoing elective surgery is central to motivating health behavior change. 
Integrating digital and mobile health technologies within the elective surgical 
pathway could be a strategy to remotely deliver this support to patients.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-ethnographic systematic review explores digital 
interventions supporting patients undergoing elective surgery with health 
behavior changes, specifically physical activity, weight loss, dietary intake, 
and psychological support.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in October 2019 across 6 electronic 
databases (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO]: 
CRD42020157813). Qualitative studies were included if they evaluated the use of 
digital technologies supporting behavior change in adult patients undergoing 
elective surgery during the pre- or postoperative period. Study quality was 
assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. A meta-ethnographic 
approach was used to synthesize existing qualitative data, using the 7 phases of 
meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare. Using this approach, along with reciprocal 
translation, enabled the development of 4 themes from the data.
RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included covering bariatric (n=2, 11%), 
cancer (n=13, 72%), and orthopedic (n=3, 17%) surgeries. The 4 overarching 
themes appear to be key in understanding and determining the effectiveness of 
digital and mobile interventions to support surgical patients. To successfully 
motivate health behavior change, technologies should provide motivation and 
support, enable patient engagement, facilitate peer networking, and meet 
individualized patient needs. Self-regulatory features such as goal setting 
heightened patient motivation. The personalization of difficulty levels in 
virtual reality-based rehabilitation was positively received. Internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy reduced depression and distress in patients 
undergoing cancer surgery. Peer networking provided emotional support beyond 
that of patient-provider relationships, improving quality of life and care 
satisfaction. Patients expressed the desire for digital interventions to be 
individually tailored according to their physical and psychological needs, 
before and after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have the potential to influence the future design of 
patient-centered digital and mobile health technologies and demonstrate a 
multipurpose role for digital technologies in the elective surgical pathway by 
motivating health behavior change and offering psychological support. Through 
the synthesis of patient suggestions, we highlight areas for digital technology 
optimization and emphasize the importance of content tailored to suit individual 
patients and surgical procedures. There is a significant rationale for involving 
patients in the cocreation of digital health technologies to enhance engagement, 
better support behavior change, and improve surgical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Although transdiagnostic forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
have been evaluated in individuals with depressive and anxiety disorders, few 
studies have examined their suitability for more severe disorders, such as 
recurrent or persistent major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or 
psychotic spectrum disorders. This study examined the acceptability and initial 
efficacy of an app-enhanced Unified Protocol for Adolescents [UP-A] when 
including youth with more severe mood disorders or psychotic spectrum disorders.
METHODS: We first adapted a mobile application (app), based on user-centered 
feedback from adolescents and their parents, to assist participants in reviewing 
session content, practicing skills learned in previous treatment sessions, and 
monitoring symptomatic progress. A total of 24 adolescents (M age = 15.2 years, 
SD = 1.6) with mood or psychotic spectrum disorders and their parents then 
participated in an open trial of the app-enhanced group treatment given over 9 
weekly sessions.
RESULTS: Adolescent participants and their parents rated the group treatment and 
mobile app as acceptable and useful. We observed significant improvements over 
the 9-week treatment in adolescents' depressive symptoms, attenuated psychotic 
symptoms, and global functioning. The frequency with which adolescents used the 
mobile app between sessions was positively related to symptomatic and functional 
gains.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial findings suggest the acceptability and feasibility of a 
mobile app that enabled adolescent participants and their parents to review 
session content and practice treatment skills. Findings also indicated 
improvements in psychiatric and functional outcomes among the adolescent 
participants over the course of the app-enhanced treatment. Randomized clinical 
trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of app-enhanced CBT in improving 
symptoms and functioning in adolescents with mood or psychotic spectrum 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: The number of mental health apps (MHapps) developed and now 
available to smartphone users has increased in recent years. MHapps and other 
technology-based solutions have the potential to play an important part in the 
future of mental health care; however, there is no single guide for the 
development of evidence-based MHapps. Many currently available MHapps lack 
features that would greatly improve their functionality, or include features 
that are not optimized. Furthermore, MHapp developers rarely conduct or publish 
trial-based experimental validation of their apps. Indeed, a previous systematic 
review revealed a complete lack of trial-based evidence for many of the hundreds 
of MHapps available.
OBJECTIVE: To guide future MHapp development, a set of clear, practical, 
evidence-based recommendations is presented for MHapp developers to create 
better, more rigorous apps.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted, scrutinizing research across diverse 
fields, including mental health interventions, preventative health, mobile 
health, and mobile app design.
RESULTS: Sixteen recommendations were formulated. Evidence for each 
recommendation is discussed, and guidance on how these recommendations might be 
integrated into the overall design of an MHapp is offered. Each recommendation 
is rated on the basis of the strength of associated evidence. It is important to 
design an MHapp using a behavioral plan and interactive framework that 
encourages the user to engage with the app; thus, it may not be possible to 
incorporate all 16 recommendations into a single MHapp.
CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials are required to validate future MHapps 
and the principles upon which they are designed, and to further investigate the 
recommendations presented in this review. Effective MHapps are required to help 
prevent mental health problems and to ease the burden on health systems.

Subthreshold depression, defined as a depressive status falling short of the 
diagnostic threshold for major depression, is common, disabling and constitutes 
a risk factor for future depressive episodes. Cognitive behavioral therapies 
(CBT) have been shown to be effective but are usually provided as packages of 
various skills. Little research has been done to investigate whether all their 
components are beneficial and contributory to mental health promotion. We 
addressed this issue by developing a smartphone CBT app that implements five 
representative CBT skills (behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, 
problem solving, assertion training and behavior therapy for insomnia), and 
conducting a master randomized study that included four 2 × 2 factorial trials 
to enable precise estimation of skill-specific efficacies. Between September 
2022 and February 2024, we recruited 3,936 adult participants with subthreshold 
depression. Among those randomized, the follow-up rate was 97% at week 6 and 
adherence to the app was 84%. The study showed that all included CBT skills and 
their combinations differentially beat all three control conditions of delayed 
treatment, health information or self-check, with effect sizes ranging between 
-0.67 (95% confidence interval: -0.81 to -0.53) and -0.16 (-0.30 to -0.02) for 
changes in depressive symptom severity from baseline to week 6, as measured with 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Knowledge of the active ingredients 
of CBT can better inform the design of more effective and scalable 
psychotherapies in the future. (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000047124 ).

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of COMPASS, a therapist-supported 
digital therapeutic for reducing psychological distress (anxiety/depression) in 
people living with long-term physical health conditions (LTCs).
METHODS: A two-armed randomized-controlled trial recruiting from LTC charities. 
Participants with anxiety and/or depression symptoms related to their LTC(s) 
were randomized (concealed allocation via independent administrator) to COMPASS 
(access to 11 tailored modules plus five thirty-minute therapist support 
sessions) or standard charity support (SCS). Assessments were completed online 
pre-randomization, at 6- and 12-weeks post-randomization. Primary outcome was 
Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale; PHQ-ADS measured at 
12-weeks. Analysis used intention-to-treat principles with adjusted mean 
differences estimated using linear mixed-effects models. Data-analyst was 
blinded to group allocation.
RESULTS: 194 participants were randomized to COMPASS (N = 94) or SCS (N = 100). 
At 12-weeks, mean level of psychological distress was 6.82 (95% confidence 
interval; CI 4.55-9.10) points lower (p < 0.001) in the COMPASS arm compared 
with SCS (standardized mean difference of 0.71 (95% CI 0.48-0.95)). The COMPASS 
arm also showed moderate significant treatment effects on secondary outcomes 
including depression, anxiety and illness-related distress and small significant 
effects on functioning and quality-of-life. Rates of adverse events were 
comparable across the arms. Deterioration in distress at 12-weeks was observed 
in 2.2% of the SCS arm, and no participants in the COMPASS arm.
CONCLUSION: Compared with SCS, COMPASS digital therapeutic with minimal 
therapist input reduces psychological distress at post-treatment (12-weeks). 
COMPASS offers a potentially scalable implementation model for health services 
but its translation to these contexts needs further evaluating.

BACKGROUND: An increase in depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms worldwide, 
attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been reported. If not treated, it may 
negatively affect a person's everyday life by altering physical and social 
well-being and productivity and increasing expenditure on health care. Cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions are gaining popularity as a means 
to reduce stress and alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms. Moreover, CBT 
delivered through a mobile app has the same elements as traditional CBT training 
(eg, guided discovery). However, unlike conventional training, users of mobile 
apps are allowed to tailor their own experience at their own speed and schedule.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze Sensa users' retrospective data and 
explore the dose-duration effect to find the optimal usage time when the user 
showed results.
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 381 consecutive community-based nonclinical 
users who started using Sensa between October 2021 and March 2022. All users 
included in the study took the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) 
assessment at least 2 times. Other parameters from the database containing all 
self-reported data were gender, number of active days, total time of use, and 
age. The primary outcome of the study was a change in the DASS-21 score. 
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 9, GraphPad 
Software). In addition, a logistic regression model was created to predict how 
the obtained independent parameters influenced the DASS-21 score.
RESULTS: The main finding of our study was that the majority of participants who 
started using Sensa were experiencing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms 
(92.13%, 80.05%, and 87.93%, respectively). There was a statistically 
significant decrease of the DASS-21 subdomain scores after the use of the 
application (anxiety: mean 7.25, SD 4.03 vs mean 6.12, SD 4.00; P=.001; 
depression: mean 11.05, SD 4.26 vs mean 9.01, SD 4.77; P=.001; stress: mean 
11.42, SD 3.44 vs mean 9.96, SD 3.65; P<.001). Finally, the logistic regression 
model showed that users who were using the app for more than 24 days and had at 
least 12 active days during that time had 3.463 (95% CI 1.142-11.93) and 2.644 
(95% CI 1.024-7.127) times higher chances to reduce their DASS-21 subdomain 
scores of depression and anxiety, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the Sensa mobile app was related to decreased depression, 
anxiety, and stress symptoms.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of using a mobile diary app as an adjunct in 
dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in patients with borderline personality 
disorder is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform an economic evaluation of a mobile diary 
app compared with paper-based diary cards in DBT treatment for patients with 
borderline personality disorder in a psychiatric outpatient facility.
METHODS: This study was conducted alongside a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized 
controlled trial. The participants were recruited at 5 Danish psychiatric 
outpatient facilities and were randomized to register the emotions, urges, and 
skills used in a mobile diary app or on paper-based diary cards. The 
participants in both groups received DBT delivered by the therapists. A 
cost-consequence analysis with a time horizon of 12 months was performed. 
Consequences included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), depression severity, 
borderline severity, suicidal behavior, health care use, treatment compliance, 
and system usability. All relevant costs were included. Focus group interviews 
were conducted with patients, therapists, researchers, and industry 
representatives to discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a 
mobile diary app.
RESULTS: A total of 78 participants were included in the analysis. An 
insignificantly higher number of participants in the paper group dropped out 
before the start of treatment (P=.07). Of those starting treatment, participants 
in the app group had an average of 37.1 (SE 27.55) more days of treatment and 
recorded an average of 3.16 (SE 5.10) more skills per week than participants in 
the paper group. Participants in both groups had a QALY gain and a decrease in 
depression severity, borderline severity, and suicidal behavior. Significant 
differences were found in favor of the paper group for both QALY gain (adjusted 
difference -0.054; SE 0.03) and reduction in depression severity (adjusted 
difference -1.11; SE 1.57). The between-group difference in total costs ranged 
from US $107.37 to US $322.10 per participant during the 12 months. The use of 
services in the health care sector was similar across both time points and 
groups (difference: psychiatric hospitalization <5 and <5; general practice 
-1.32; SE 3.68 and 2.02; SE 3.19). Overall, the patients showed high 
acceptability and considered the app as being easy to use. Therapists worried 
about potential negative influences on the therapist-patient interaction from 
new work tasks accompanying the introduction of the new technology but pointed 
at innovation potential from digital database registrations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests both positive and negative consequences of 
mobile diary apps as adjuncts to DBT compared with paper diary cards. More 
research is needed to draw conclusions regarding its cost-effectiveness.

Background There has been growing support for digital Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy (dCBT-I) as a scalable intervention that both reduces insomnia and 
prevents depression. However, the mechanisms by which dCBT-I reduces and 
prevents depression is less clear. Methods This was a randomized controlled 
trial with two parallel arms: dCBT-I (N=358), or online sleep education as the 
control condition (N=300). Outcome variables were measured at pre-treatment, 
post-treatment, and one-year follow-up, and included the Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), and the 
Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ). The analyses tested change in PTQ 
scores as a mediator for post-treatment insomnia, post-treatment depression, and 
incident depression at one-year follow-up. Results Reductions in rumination 
(PTQ) were significantly larger in the dCBT-I condition compared to control. 
Results also showed that reductions in rumination significantly mediated the 
improvement in post-treatment insomnia severity (proportional effect = 11%) and 
post-treatment depression severity (proportional effect = 19%) associated with 
the dCBT-I condition. Finally, reductions in rumination also significantly 
mediated the prevention of clinically significant depression via dCBT-I 
(proportional effect = 42%). Limitations Depression was measured with a 
validated self-report instrument instead of clinical interviews. Durability of 
results beyond one-year follow-up should also be tested in future research. 
Conclusions Results provide evidence that rumination is an important mechanism 
in how dCBT-I reduces and prevents depression.

BACKGROUND: Across a range of age, educational and clinical characteristics, 
adults experiencing depression and anxiety already use digital technology to 
manage their symptoms. Although several reviews and meta-analyses indicated 
feasibility and efficacy for adults with depression and anxiety, digital 
treatments are poorly accessed and disseminated. This review illustrates 
potentials and limitations of interventions that specifically leveraged unique 
features of digital technology and were grounded in the principles of Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic 
database search was conducted in October 2021. Peer-reviewed, English-language 
studies were included if i) they reported data from RCTs for adults aged 18+ who 
engaged with CBT-informed digital interventions targeting primarily depression 
and anxiety; ii) they used at least PHQ-9 or GAD-7 as standardized and validated 
assessment self-report measures for depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: Findings from 35 RCTs examining 33 interventions (25 internet-based, 6 
mobile-based, a2 mobile/web) are discussed. The quality of the evidence differed 
widely as many small-scale RCTs reported only short-term feasibility and 
preliminary efficacy. Effects of CBT-informed digital interventions were 
substantially larger when compared to waitlist than active control conditions. 
Greater therapeutic benefits were observed for interventions that offered 
clinical assistance or were used in combination with other treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: CBT-informed digital interventions have accumulated enough 
scientific evidence to be positioned today as: i) a low-intensity tool for those 
with subclinical levels of symptoms; ii) a first step in a stepped-care approach 
to service delivery iii) a low-cost, easily accessible option for targeted 
preventive programs.

Several reviews focused on the use of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
across different populations. This review synthesized randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital CBT on psychological 
symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). An extensive search was 
conducted in 10 databases from inception until August 29, 2021. A meta-analysis 
using a random-effects model was performed using Hedges' g. The potential 
sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses and 
meta-regression analysis. A total of 18 RCTs in 2514 perinatal women were 
identified from over 23 countries. The sample size ranged from 25 to 910. 
Meta-analyses showed that digital CBT significantly reduced depression 
(g = -0.56, 95% CI: -0.85, -0.27, I2 = 84.81%, p < 0.001), anxiety (g = -0.30, 
95% CI: -0.44, -0.17, I2 = 0%, p < 0.001), and stress (g = -0.75, 95% CI: -0.95, 
-0.56, I2 = 0%, p < 0.001) symptoms at post-intervention and stress symptoms at 
follow-up (g = -0.52, 95% CI: -0.93, -0.11, I2 = 0%, p = 0.01) compared with 
those in the control group. Subgroup analyses highlighted that the intervention 
was effective when CBT was combined with other therapeutic components which 
delivered via a mobile application. Preferable features of intervention should 
be more than eight sessions and conducted for than 6 weeks among postnatal 
women. Multivariable meta-regression showed that age was a significant covariate 
on depression symptoms. The sample size in the selected RCTs was small, and the 
overall quality of the evidence was very low. Digital CBT is a potential 
intervention for alleviating psychological outcomes in perinatal women. This 
review suggests the essential features to optimize the intervention effect. 
Further well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Despite the growing number of mental health apps available for 
smartphones, the perceived usability of these apps from the perspectives of end 
users or health care experts has rarely been reported. This information is 
vital, particularly for self-guided mHealth interventions, as perceptions of 
navigability and quality of content are likely to impact participant engagement 
and treatment compliance.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a usability evaluation of a 
personalized, self-guided, app-based intervention for depression.
METHODS: Participants were administered the System Usability Scale and 
open-ended questions as part of a semistructured interview. There were 15 
participants equally divided into 3 groups: (1) individuals with clinical 
depression who were the target audience for the app, (2) mental health 
professionals, and (3) researchers who specialize in the area of eHealth 
interventions and/or depression research.
RESULTS: The end-user group rated the app highly, both in quantitative and 
qualitative assessments. The 2 expert groups highlighted the self-monitoring 
features and range of established psychological treatment options (such as 
behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring) but had concerns that the 
amount and layout of content may be difficult for end users to navigate in a 
self-directed fashion. The end-user data did not confirm these concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging participant engagement via self-monitoring and 
feedback, as well as personalized messaging, may be a viable way to maintain 
participation in self-guided interventions. Further evaluation is necessary to 
determine whether levels of engagement with these features enhance treatment 
effects.

Leading causes in global health-related burden include stress, depression, 
anger, fatigue, insomnia, substance abuse, and increased suicidality. While all 
individuals are at risk, certain career fields such as military service are at 
an elevated risk. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is highly effective at 
treating mental health disorders but suffers from low compliance and high 
dropout rates in military environments. The current study conducted a randomized 
controlled trial with military personnel to assess outcomes for an asymptomatic 
group (n = 10) not receiving mental health treatment, a symptomatic group 
(n = 10) using a mHealth application capable of monitoring physiological stress 
via a commercial wearable alerting users to the presence of stress, guiding them 
through stress reduction techniques, and communicating information to providers, 
and a symptomatic control group (n = 10) of military personnel undergoing CBT. 
Fifty percent of symptomatic controls dropped out of CBT early and the group 
maintained baseline symptoms. In contrast, those who used the mHealth 
application completed therapy and showed a significant reduction in symptoms of 
depression, anxiety, stress, and anger. The results from this study demonstrate 
the feasibility of pairing data-driven mobile applications with CBT in 
vulnerable populations, leading to an improvement in therapy compliance and a 
reduction in symptoms compared to CBT treatment alone. Future work is focused on 
the inclusion of passive sensing modalities and the integration of additional 
data sources to provide better insights and inform clinical decisions to improve 
personalized support.

BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent and have broad-ranging 
negative implications. Digital interventions are increasingly available in the 
workplace context, but supporting evidence is limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of 3 digital interventions for depressive symptoms in a 
sample of UK-based working adults experiencing mild to moderate symptoms.
METHODS: This was a parallel, multiarm, pilot randomized controlled trial. 
Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 digital interventions or a waitlist 
control group and had 3 weeks to complete 6 to 8 short self-guided sessions. The 
3 interventions are available on the Unmind mental health app for working adults 
and draw on behavioral activation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance 
and commitment therapy. Web-based assessments were conducted at baseline, 
postintervention (week 3), and at 1-month follow-up (week 7). Participants were 
recruited via Prolific, a web-based recruitment platform, and the study was 
conducted entirely on the web. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed using 
objective engagement data and self-reported feedback. Efficacy outcomes were 
assessed using validated self-report measures of mental health and functioning 
and linear mixed models with intention-to-treat principles.
RESULTS: In total, 2003 individuals were screened for participation, of which 
20.22% (405/2003) were randomized. A total of 92% (373/405) of the participants 
were retained in the study, 97.4% (295/303) initiated their allocated 
intervention, and 66.3% (201/303) completed all sessions. Moreover, 80.6% 
(229/284) of the participants rated the quality of their allocated intervention 
as excellent or good, and 79.6% (226/284) of the participants were satisfied or 
very satisfied with their intervention. All active groups showed improvements in 
well-being, functioning, and depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with the 
control group, which were maintained at 4 weeks. Hedges g effect sizes for 
depressive symptoms ranged from -0.53 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.81) to -0.74 (95% CI 
-0.45 to -1.03).
CONCLUSIONS: All interventions were feasible and acceptable, and the preliminary 
efficacy findings indicated that their use may improve depressive symptoms, 
well-being, and functioning. The predefined criteria for a definitive trial were 
met.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions offer a scalable solution that 
reduces barriers to seeking care for clinical depression and anxiety.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week therapist 
supported, app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program in improving symptoms 
of depression and anxiety within 9 months.
METHODS: A total of 323 participants with mild to moderately severe depression 
or anxiety were enrolled in a 12-week digital cognitive behavior therapy 
program. The analysis was restricted to participants who provided at least one 
follow-up assessment after baseline. As a result, 146 participants (45.2%) were 
included in the analysis-74 (50.7%) participants completed assessments at 3 
months, 31 participants (21.2%) completed assessments at 6 months, and 21 
participants (14.4%) completed assessments at 9 months. The program included 
structured lessons and tools (ie, exercises and practices) as well as one-on-one 
weekly video counseling sessions with a licensed therapist for 12 weeks and 
monthly check-in sessions for 1 year. The clinically validated Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used 
to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Linear mixed-effects modeling 
was employed to examine changes in depression and anxiety over time.
RESULTS: We observed a significant positive effect of program time on 
improvement in depression (β=-0.12, P<.001) and anxiety scores (β=-0.10, 
P<.001). At the end of the 12-week intervention, we observed an average 
reduction of 3.76 points (95% CI -4.76 to -2.76) in PHQ-8 scores. Further 
reductions in depression were seen at program month 6 (4.75-point reduction, 95% 
CI -6.61 to -2.88) and program month 9 (6.42-point reduction, 95% CI -8.66 to 
-6.55, P<.001). A similar pattern of improvement emerged for anxiety, with a 
3.17-point reduction at the end of the 12-week intervention (95% CI -4.21 to 
-2.13). These improvements were maintained at program month 6 (4.87-point 
reduction, 95% CI -6.85 to -2.87) and program month 9 (5.19-point, 95% -6.85 to 
4.81). In addition, greater program engagement during the first 12 weeks 
predicted a greater reduction in depression (β=-0.29, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that digital interventions can support 
sustained and clinically meaningful improvements in depression and anxiety. 
Furthermore, it appears that strong initial digital mental health intervention 
engagement may facilitate this effect. However, the study was limited by 
postintervention participant attrition as well as the retrospective 
observational study design.

BACKGROUND: Technology-enabled services (TES; clinical services that include 
both technology-driven [e.g., personal sensing technologies] and person-powered 
support elements) may address gaps in depression and anxiety treatments in 
healthcare settings. The current study: (1) developed a TES tailored for Primary 
Care patients with depression and/or anxiety, and (2) conducted a pilot 
randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of the TES compared to a 
digital psychoeducation control app.
METHODS: Participants were randomized to either: (1) TES: the "Vira" smartphone 
app (Ksana Health Inc.), informed by behavioral activation and using passive 
sensing technology to provide behavioral "insights" and target behaviors 
associated with mental health symptoms, alongside lay-provider coaching, or (2) 
Control: the Mood Education mobile app (ME), containing static psychoeducational 
resources designed to target mental health symptoms. Both apps collected usage 
data. Participants completed assessments on depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), 
health-related quality of life (PedsQL), and engagement (TWEETs) at baseline, 
mid-treatment (week 4), end-of-treatment (week 8), and post-treatment (week 12).
RESULTS: Participants (N = 130) were randomized to receive either the TES (Vira; 
Mage= 30) or ME (Mage= 33). Linear mixed-effects models determined significant 
improvements in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores for participants across both conditions 
(ps < 0.001). There was no interactive effect of intervention and time for the 
PHQ-9 (p = .90) nor the GAD-7 (p = .49). Adjusting for baseline differences and 
randomization strata, TES participants reported a greater change in a quality of 
life rating of Physical Functioning (PedsQL) across time (p = .018). TES 
participants also reported higher levels of engagement and demonstrated higher 
app usage. However, adjusting for baseline symptom severity, neither app usage 
nor coach interaction frequency moderated outcomes (ps ≥ 0.2).
CONCLUSIONS: While the TES demonstrated superior engagement, improvements in 
depressive and anxious symptoms for both conditions speak to the potential 
benefit of both TES and low-intensity psychoeducation treatments in care 
settings. Future research is needed to better understand which patients might 
differentially benefit from TESs and broader personal sensing technologies over 
low-intensity treatments.

BACKGROUND: Chatbots are a relatively new technology that has shown promising 
outcomes for mental health symptoms in adults; however, few studies have been 
done with adolescents or reported adolescent user experiences and 
recommendations for chatbot development.
METHODS: Twenty three participants ages 13-18 (Mage  = 14.96) engaged in user 
testing of a chatbot developed to psychoeducate adolescents on depression, teach 
behavioral activation, and change negative thoughts. Thematic analysis was 
conducted of participants' responses to user experience questions, impressions, 
and recommendations.
RESULTS: Over half (56.5%) of the sample completed the full intervention and 
provided user experience feedback online. The average NPS score was 6.04 
(SD = 2.18), and 64.3% (n = 9) said they would use the chatbot in the future. Of 
all user experience responses, 54.5% were positive. The most common impressions 
were related to symptom improvement (61.1%) and availability (52.8%) The most 
frequent recommendations were related to solving technical problems (66%).
CONCLUSIONS: Chatbots for mental health are acceptable to some adolescents, a 
population that tends to be reluctant to engage with traditional mental health 
services. Most participants reported positive experiences with the chatbot, 
believing that it could help with symptom improvement and is highly available. 
Adolescents highlighted some technical and stylistic problems that developers 
should consider. More pilot and user testing is needed to develop mental health 
chatbots that are appealing and relevant to adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Stress management in the workplace is essential for a healthy mental 
and physical state. Due to technological advancements, individually tailored 
therapy and online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are on the rise.
OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the efficacy of a smartphone app based on 
third-wave CBT tailored to an individual.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 126 participants who 
were divided into 2 groups. The intervention group used the smartphone app 
BetterLife for 10 weeks, while the control group was placed on a waiting list 
for the same duration. The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS), Korean Utrecht Work 
Engagement Scale-9 (UWES), World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment 
(WHOQOL), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) 
were administered at baseline and after 10 weeks to both groups.
RESULTS: Of the 126 participants, 11 dropped out during the trial. A 2-way 
repeated measure analysis of covariance was conducted, controlling for baseline 
BDI. There were greater improvements in PSS (F=24.33, P<.001, η2=0.17) and UWESK 
scores (F=8.32, P=.0046, η2=0.06) in the intervention group than in the control 
group. WHOQOL scores exhibited statistically significant improvement in the 
intervention group in the overall quality of life (F=8.19, P=.0049, η2=0.06), 
physical health (F=8.87, P=.003, η2=0.07), psychological health (F=13.32, 
P<.001, η2=0.10), social relationships (F=19.43, P<.001, η2=0.14), and 
environmental domains (F=10.14, P=.002, η2=0.08) but not overall health (F=1.68, 
P=.20). BDI (F=7.17, P=.008, η2=0.06) and BAI (F=6.00, P=.02, η2=0.05) showed a 
statistically significant improvement in the intervention group, but this 
significance did not survive the Bonferroni correction (P<.005).
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that smartphone-based CBT is a 
viable option for reducing stress in the workplace.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and mood problems in adolescents often go unnoticed and may 
therefore remain untreated. Identifying and preventing the development of 
emotional problems requires monitoring and effective tools to strengthen 
adolescents' resilience, for example, by enhancing coping skills.
OBJECTIVE: This study describes the developmental process, feasibility, and 
acceptance of Grow It!, a multiplayer serious game app for adolescents aged 
12-25 years. The app consists of the experience sampling method (ESM) to monitor 
thoughts, behaviors, and emotions in daily life to enhance self-insight and 
daily cognitive behavioral therapy-based challenges to promote adaptive coping.
METHODS: Our approach entails an iterative game design process combined with an 
agile method to develop the smartphone app. The incorporated game features (ie, 
challenges, chat functionality, and visual representation) in the Grow It! app 
were co-designed with adolescent end users to increase participant engagement 
and adherence.
RESULTS: The Grow It! app was delivered for Android and iOS in May 2020. Grow 
It! was offered to adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis between May and 
December 2020. Participants of the Grow It! COVID-19 study (sample 1: N=685; 
mean age 16.19, SD 3.11 years; 193/685, 28.2% boys; sample 2: N=1035; mean age 
18.78, SD 3.51 years; 193/1035, 18.64% boys) completed 31.5% (13.2/42) to 49.5% 
(10.4/21) of challenges. Compliance of ESM was suboptimal (35.1/210, 16.7% to 
32.5/105, 30.9%). Follow-up questionnaires indicated an overall score of the app 
of 7.1 out of 10. Moreover, 72.6% (278/383) to 75.6% (487/644) would recommend 
the app to friends.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, Grow It! is the first gamified ESM app that both 
measures individual differences in emotional dynamics and offers an integrated 
cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention. Our findings support the 
feasibility and acceptance, and therefore applicability, of the Grow It! app in 
adolescents. Further iterations of this serious game app will focus on the 
increase of compliance and on providing participants feedback through their 
personal mood profiles.

OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of smartphone-assisted online brief cognitive 
behavioral therapy (b-CBT) to treat maternal depression compared to online brief 
CBT plus an active control app.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Assessments were performed 
at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), post-treatment (T2, week 8), and 
follow-up (T3, 2-month postnatal follow-up) by blinded interviewers. The primary 
outcome was depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
(EPDS) at T2. We also assessed anxiety, stress, sleep quality, well-being, 
physical activity, treatment response, and offspring child behavior problems.
RESULTS: Eighty-one participants were randomized to the intervention (n=37) or 
active control (n=44) groups. Seventy-one participants completed the 
post-treatment assessment or reported primary outcome data. No differences were 
found between the intervention and active control groups regarding maternal 
depression or other mental health outcomes. Overall, we found large within-group 
effect sizes, with 80% of the total sample responding to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference between the groups, suggesting that 
adding apps to psychotherapy treatment may not enhance treatment effects on 
prenatal depression. A within-groups analysis showed that most participants with 
depression responded to treatment; however, future studies are needed to confirm 
whether this effect is related to factors other than the intervention.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) is an evidence-based treatment for 
depression that fosters engagement in values-based activities to increase access 
to positive reinforcement. Depressed mood has been shown to hinder smoking 
cessation.
OBJECTIVE: This study determined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 
mobile app to motivate smokers to quit by using BA and integrating motivational 
messages to quit smoking.
METHODS: Adult smokers (N=56; mean age 34.5, SD 9.52 years) who were not ready 
to quit smoking within 30 days were recruited from advertisements and randomized 
to either 8 weeks of the BA app (set 2 values-based activities per 
week+motivational messages+feedback on changes in smoking, mood, and 
values-based activities) or the control group (no app; received resources for 
quitting smoking). All participants completed the baseline and end-of-treatment 
web-based questionnaires. Controls also completed weekly web-based assessments, 
and BA app participants completed assessments through the app.
RESULTS: There were no dropouts and only 2 participants in each condition did 
not complete the end-of-treatment questionnaire. The results demonstrated that 
it is feasible to recruit smokers who are unmotivated to quit into a smoking 
cessation induction trial: 86% (57/66) of eligible participants were randomized 
(BA app: n=27; control: n=29). Participants reported high levels of 
satisfaction: 80% (20/25) of participants said they would recommend the BA app, 
there were moderate-to-high scores on the Mobile App Rating Scale, and 88% 
(22/25) of participants rated the app 3 stars or higher (out of 5). There were 
high levels of BA app engagement: 96% (26/27) of participants planned 
activities, and 67% (18/27) of participants planned 7 or more activities. High 
engagement was found even among those who were at the highest risk for continued 
smoking (low motivation to quit, low confidence to quit, and high negative 
affect). The results provided support for the hypothesized relationships between 
BA constructs: greater pleasant activity completion was associated with greater 
positive affect (b=0.37, SE 0.21; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.79; P=.08), and greater 
positive affect tended to predict fewer cigarettes smoked the next day (b=-0.19, 
SE 0.10; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.01; P=.06). Additionally, a greater number of 
activities planned was associated with lower negative affect (b=-0.26, SE 0.15; 
95% CI -0.55 to 0.04; P=.09). Overall, 16% (4/25) of BA app participants set a 
quit date versus 4% (1/27) among controls, and there were promising (but not 
significant) trends for motivation and confidence to quit.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a mobile app intervention can be made 
appealing to smokers who are unmotivated to quit by focusing on aspects most 
important to them, such as mood management. This theory-based intervention has 
shown some initial support for the underlying theoretical constructs, and 
further efficacy testing is warranted in a fully powered trial.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a serious, disabling mental disorder that severely 
affects quality of life. Patients with depression often do not receive adequate 
treatment. App-based psychotherapy is considered to have great potential to 
treat depression owing to its reach and easy accessibility.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the impact of app-based psychological interventions 
for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. We 
searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 23, 2020. We selected 
randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of app-based psychological 
interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. Study 
selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal (using the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias tool for randomized studies and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized 
studies) were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Where possible, we pooled 
data using random effects meta-analyses to obtain estimates of the effect size 
of the intervention. We conducted post hoc meta-regression analyses to explore 
the factors associated with intervention success.
RESULTS: After screening 3468 unique references retrieved from bibliographic 
searches and assessing the eligibility of 79 full texts, we identified 12 trials 
(2859 participants) evaluating 14 different interventions. Of 14 trials, 7 (58%) 
were conducted in the United States; 3 (25%) trials, in Asia (Japan, South 
Korea, and China); 1 (8%) trial, in Australia; and 1 (8%) trial, in Germany. Of 
the 12 trials, 5 (42%) trials presented a low risk of bias. The mean duration of 
the interventions was 6.6 (SD 2.8) weeks. Two-thirds of the interventions were 
based on cognitive behavioral therapy alone or included it in combination with 
cognitive control therapy, positive psychology, brief behavioral activation, or 
mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapy. With no evidence of publication bias, 
a pooled analysis of 83% (10/12) of the trials and 86% (12/14) of the 
interventions showed that app-based interventions, compared with a control group 
receiving usual care or minimal intervention, produced a moderate reduction in 
depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.51, 95% CI -0.69 to 
-0.33; 2018/2859, 70.58% of the participants; I2=70%). Our meta-regression 
analyses indicated that there was a greater reduction in symptoms of depression 
(P=.04) in trials that included participants with moderate to severe depression 
(SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.55), compared with trials with participants 
exhibiting mild to moderate depression (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: App-based interventions targeted at people with depression produce 
moderate reductions in the symptoms of depression. More methodologically robust 
trials are needed to confirm our findings, determine which intervention features 
are associated with greater improvements, and identify those populations most 
likely to benefit from this type of intervention.

Mobile Sensing and Support for People With Depression: A Pilot Trial in the 
Wild.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with 
high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several 
months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental 
health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a 
large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring 
behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and 
providing context-sensitive intervention support.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection 
of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a 
clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of 
context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people 
with depressive symptoms.
METHODS: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone 
app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor 
information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive 
behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each 
subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, 
location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete 
a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon 
tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. 
Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and 
change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on 
smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global 
positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer 
behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention 
delivery.
RESULTS: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for ≥2 weeks. For subjects with 
clinical depression (PHQ-9≥11) at baseline and adherence ≥8 weeks (n=12), a 
significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative 
trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary 
classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of 
PHQ-9≥11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross 
validation resulted in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone 
sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and 
personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used 
the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in 
self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on 
features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, 
GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of 
depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness 
must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new 
generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to 
provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive 
monitoring of critical mental health states.

AIM: Diabetes-related distress is common in diabetes and has implications for 
well-being. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and third-wave CBT hold promise 
as treatments for diabetes-related distress, although previous findings are 
inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to 
understand the efficacy of these interventions in treating diabetes-related 
distress, while also assessing the associative benefits of these interventions 
on depression, anxiety and glycaemic control. We also aimed to conduct a 
narrative synthesis, and subgroup analyses to identify intervention components 
most useful in treating diabetes-related distress.
METHOD: We searched seven electronic databases from inception to April 2021. 
Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers. Methodological 
quality was assessed. The protocol was registered with the Prospective Register 
Of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42021240628.
RESULTS: We included 22 randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy 
of CBT and third-wave CBT interventions on diabetes-related distress. CBT for 
diabetes-related distress significantly reduced distress (SMD = -0.278, 
p = 0.010) and depression (SMD = -0.604, p = 0.016). Third-wave CBT for 
diabetes-related distress significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.451, 
p = 0.034). No significant effect of either intervention on glycated haemoglobin 
was observed. CBT interventions that included a digital component, were 
delivered by a psychological practitioner, and included behavioural activation 
bolstered the effects on diabetes-related distress.
CONCLUSIONS: CBT aiming to target diabetes-related distress is beneficial for 
distress and depression. Third-wave CBT for diabetes-related distress is 
beneficial for anxiety. More work is needed to optimise interventions to improve 
both mental and physical health outcomes in people with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders affect 1 in 10 people globally, of whom 
approximately 300 million are affected by depression. At least half of the 
people affected by depression remain untreated. Although cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, access to mental health specialists, 
habitually challenging, has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Internet-based CBT is an effective and feasible strategy to increase access to 
treatment for people with depression. Mental health apps may further assist in 
facilitating self-management for people affected by depression; however, 
accessing the correct app may be cumbersome given the large number and wide 
variety of apps offered by public app marketplaces.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically assess the features, functionality, 
data security, and congruence with evidence of self-guided CBT-based apps 
targeting users affected by depression that are available in major app stores.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic assessment of self-guided CBT-based apps 
available in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Apps launched or updated since 
August 2018 were identified through a systematic search in the 42matters 
database using CBT-related terms. Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were 
downloaded and assessed using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (Android 9) and iPhone 7 
(iOS 13.3.1). Apps were appraised using a 182-question checklist developed by 
the research team, assessing their general characteristics, technical aspects 
and quality assurance, and CBT-related features, including 6 evidence-based CBT 
techniques (ie, psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, 
problem solving, relaxation, and exposure for comorbid anxiety) as informed by a 
CBT manual, CBT competence framework, and a literature review of internet-based 
CBT clinical trial protocols. The results were reported as a narrative review 
using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 3006 apps, of which 98 met the inclusion 
criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 well-being apps; 65 
mental health apps, targeting two or more common mental health disorders, 
including depression; and 13 depression apps. A total of 28 apps offered at 
least four evidence-based CBT techniques, particularly depression apps. 
Cognitive restructuring was the most common technique, offered by 79% (77/98) of 
the apps. Only one-third of the apps offered suicide risk management resources, 
whereas 17% (17/98) of the apps offered COVID-19-related information. Although 
most apps included a privacy policy, only a third of the apps presented it 
before account creation. In total, 82% (74/90) of privacy policies stated 
sharing data with third-party service providers. Half of the app development 
teams included academic institutions or health care providers.
CONCLUSIONS: Only a few self-guided CBT-based apps offer comprehensive CBT 
programs or suicide risk management resources. Sharing of users' data is 
widespread, highlighting shortcomings in health app market governance. To 
fulfill their potential, self-guided CBT-based apps should follow evidence-based 
clinical guidelines, be patient centered, and enhance users' data security.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health (DMH) tools use technology (eg, websites and 
mobile apps) to conveniently deliver mental health resources to users in real 
time, reducing access barriers. Underserved communities facing health care 
provider shortages and limited mental health resources may benefit from DMH 
tools, as these tools can help improve access to resources.
OBJECTIVE: This study described the development and feasibility evaluation of 
the Emotional Needs Evaluation and Resource Guide for You (ENERGY) System, a DMH 
tool to meet the mental health and resource needs of youth and their families 
developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ENERGY System offers a 
brief assessment of resource needs; problem-solving capabilities; and symptoms 
of depression, anxiety, trauma, and alcohol and substance use followed by 
automated, personalized feedback based on the participant's responses.
METHODS: Individuals aged ≥15 years were recruited through community partners, 
community events, targeted electronic health record messages, and social media. 
Participants completed screening questions to establish eligibility, entered 
demographic information, and completed the ENERGY System assessment. Based on 
the participant's responses, the ENERGY System immediately delivered digital 
resources tailored to their identified areas of need (eg, relaxation). A subset 
of participants also voluntarily completed the following: COVID-19 Exposure and 
Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) or COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey 
Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA); resource needs assessment; and 
feedback on their experience using the ENERGY System. If resource needs (eg, 
housing and food insecurity) were endorsed, lists of local resources were 
provided.
RESULTS: A total of 212 individuals accessed the ENERGY System link, of which 96 
(45.3%) completed the screening tool and 86 (40.6%) received resources. 
Participant responses on the mental health screening questions triggered on 
average 2.04 (SD 1.94) intervention domains. Behavioral Activation/Increasing 
Activities was the most frequently launched intervention domain (56%, 54/96), 
and domains related to alcohol or substance use were the least frequent (4%, 
4/96). The most frequently requested support areas were finances (33%, 32/96), 
transportation (26%, 25/96), and food (24%, 23/96). The CEFIS and CEFIS-AYA 
indicated higher than average impacts from the pandemic (ie, average scores 
>2.5). Participants were satisfied with the ENERGY System overall (65%, 39/60) 
as well as the length of time it took to answer the questions (90%, 54/60), 
which they found easy to answer (87%, 52/60).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided initial support for the feasibility of the 
ENERGY System, a DMH tool capable of screening for resource and mental health 
needs and providing automated, personalized, and free resources and techniques 
to meet the identified needs. Future studies should seek direct feedback from 
community members to further improve the ENERGY System and its dissemination to 
encourage use.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) is receiving renewed interest as a 
stand-alone or as a component of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for 
depression. However, few studies have examined which aspects of BA are most 
contributory to its efficacy.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a 9-week randomized controlled trial of 
smartphone CBT for patients with major depression. Depression severity was 
measured at baseline and at end of treatment by the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9. All aspects of behavioral activation tasks that the 
participants had engaged in, including their expected mastery and pleasure and 
obtained mastery and pleasure, were recorded in the web server. We examined 
their contribution to improvement in depression as simple correlations and in 
stepwise multivariable linear regression.
RESULTS: Among the 78 patients who completed at least one behavioral experiment, 
all aspects of expected or achieved mastery or pleasure correlated with change 
in depression severity. Discrepancy between the expectation and achievement, 
representing unexpected gain in mastery or pleasure, was not correlated. In 
stepwise regression, expected mastery and pleasure, especially the maximum level 
of the latter, emerged as the strongest contributing factors.
LIMITATIONS: The study is observational and cannot deduce cause-effect 
relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: It may be the expected and continued sense of pleasure in planning 
activities that are most meaningful and rewarding to individuals, and not the 
simple level or amount of obtained pleasure, that contributes to the efficacy of 
BA.

Orthostatic dysregulation (OD), a common psychosomatic disorder in children, is 
caused by circulation disturbance resulting from autonomic imbalance. OD is a 
significant public health threat due to its association with school refusal and 
depression in children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children suffered 
from school closures, lack of exercise, smartphone addiction, and school 
refusal. The COVID-19 pandemic made it much more difficult to deliver existing 
approaches to patients and families with OD and increased the risk of prolonged 
and severe OD. In response, web-based digital health solutions are expected to 
support patients and families. Digital therapeutics for OD can not only deliver 
established treatments online, such as pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy 
but also provide new interventions, such as regular mental health programs led 
by clinical psychologists. It is necessary to keep in mind that digital 
therapeutics are not intended to replace established treatments, but rather to 
supplement them and provide additional support. However, most research on OD has 
been conducted in Japan. Therefore, to provide unique findings from Japan, it is 
important to conduct further epidemiological research using large-scale 
databases in the real world and reveal the clinical characteristics and detailed 
epidemiology of OD, leading to the development of novel treatments.

BACKGROUND: Integrated digital interventions for the treatment of comorbid 
depression and substance use disorder have been developed, and evidence of their 
effectiveness is mixed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore potential reasons for mixed findings in 
the literature on integrated digital treatments. We described the methodologies 
and core characteristics of these interventions, identified the presence of 
evidence-based treatment strategies, examined patterns across digital 
modalities, and highlighted areas of overlap as well as critical gaps in the 
existing evidence base.
METHODS: In June 2024, a literature search was conducted in Google Scholar to 
identify digital integrated interventions for comorbid major depressive disorder 
and substance use disorder. Articles were included if they described 
interventions targeting both conditions simultaneously; were grounded in 
cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, or motivational 
enhancement therapy; and were delivered at least in part via digital modalities. 
In total, 14 studies meeting these criteria were coded using an open-coding 
approach to identify intervention characteristics and treatment strategies 
(n=25). Statistical analyses summarized descriptive statistics to capture the 
frequency and overlap of these strategies.
RESULTS: Studies included a range of digital modalities: internet (n=6, 43%), 
computer (n=3, 21%), smartphone (n=2, 14%), and supportive text messaging 
interventions (n=3, 21%). Half (n=7, 50%) of the studies included participants 
with mild to moderate depression symptom severity and hazardous substance use. 
Only 36% (n=5) of the studies required participants to meet full diagnostic 
criteria for major depressive disorder for inclusion and 21% (n=3) required a 
substance use disorder diagnosis. Most interventions targeted adults (n=11, 
79%), with few targeting young or emerging adults (n=4, 29%), and only 36% (n=5) 
reported detailed demographic data. Treatment duration averaged 10.3 (SD 6.8) 
weeks. Internet-based interventions offered the widest range of treatment 
strategies (mean 11.7), while supportive text messaging used the fewest (mean 
4.6). Common treatment strategies included self-monitoring (n=11, 79%), 
psychoeducation (n=10, 71%), and coping skills (n=9, 64%). Interventions often 
combined therapeutic strategies, with psychoeducation frequently paired with 
self-monitoring (n=9, 64%), assessment (n=7, 50%), coping skills (n=7, 50%), 
decisional balance (n=7, 50%), feedback (n=7, 50%), and goal setting (n=7, 50%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among integrated digital interventions for comorbid depression and 
substance use, there was noteworthy variability in methodology, inclusion 
criteria, digital modalities, and embedded treatment strategies. Without 
standardized methods, comparison of the clinical outcomes across studies is 
challenging. These results emphasize the critical need for future research to 
adopt standardized approaches to facilitate more accurate comparisons and a 
clearer understanding of intervention efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Most patients with cancer experience psychological or physical 
distress, which can adversely affect their quality of life (QOL). Smartphone app 
interventions are increasingly being used to improve QOL and psychological 
outcomes in patients with cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence 
regarding the effect of this type of intervention, with conflicting results in 
the literature.
OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the 
effectiveness of mobile phone app interventions on QOL and psychological 
outcomes in adult patients with cancer, with a special focus on intervention 
duration, type of cancer, intervention theory, treatment strategy, and 
intervention delivery format.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, the 
Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and 
WanFang to identify studies involving apps that focused on cancer survivors and 
QOL or psychological symptoms published from inception to October 30, 2022. We 
selected only randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria and 
performed systematic review and meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference 
(SMD) with a 95% CI was pooled when needed. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses 
were also conducted.
RESULTS: In total, 30 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5353 
participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with routine care, 
app interventions might improve QOL (SMD=0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.51; P<.001); 
enhance self-efficacy (SMD=0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.29; P=.03); and alleviate anxiety 
(SMD=-0.64, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.56; P<.001), depression (SMD=-0.33, 95% CI -0.58 
to -0.08; P=.009), and distress (SMD=-0.34, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.08; P=.01). 
Short-term (duration of ≤3 months), physician-patient interaction (2-way 
communication using a smartphone app), and cognitive behavioral therapy 
interventions might be the most effective for improving QOL and alleviating 
adverse psychological effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that interventions using mobile health apps might 
improve QOL and self-efficacy as well as alleviate anxiety, depression, and 
distress in adult cancer survivors. However, these results should be interpreted 
with caution because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and the study 
design. More rigorous trials are warranted to confirm the suitable duration and 
validate the different intervention theories as well as address methodological 
flaws in previous studies.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) platforms show promise in the management of 
mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. This has resulted in an 
abundance of mHealth platforms available for research or commercial use.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to characterize the current state of 
mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression that are available for 
research, commercial use, or both.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using a two-pronged approach: 
searching relevant literature with prespecified search terms to identify 
platforms in published research and simultaneously searching 2 major app 
stores-Google Play Store and Apple App Store-to identify commercially available 
platforms. Key characteristics of the mHealth platforms were synthesized, such 
as platform name, targeted condition, targeted group, purpose, technology type, 
intervention type, commercial availability, and regulatory information.
RESULTS: The literature and app store searches yielded 169 and 179 mHealth 
platforms, respectively. Most platforms developed for research purposes were 
designed for depression (116/169, 68.6%), whereas the app store search reported 
a higher number of platforms developed for anxiety (Android: 58/179, 32.4%; iOS: 
27/179, 15.1%). The most common purpose of platforms in both searches was 
treatment (literature search: 122/169, 72.2%; app store search: 129/179, 72.1%). 
With regard to the types of intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy and 
referral to care or counseling emerged as the most popular options offered by 
the platforms identified in the literature and app store searches, respectively. 
Most platforms from both searches did not have a specific target age group. In 
addition, most platforms found in app stores lacked clinical and real-world 
evidence, and a small number of platforms found in the published research were 
available commercially.
CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or 
depression are available for research, commercial use, or both. The 
characteristics of these mHealth platforms greatly vary. Future efforts should 
focus on assessing the quality-utility, safety, and effectiveness-of the 
existing platforms and providing developers, from both commercial and research 
sectors, a reporting guideline for their platform description and a regulatory 
framework to facilitate the development, validation, and deployment of effective 
mHealth platforms.

BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress in our understanding of depression, 
prevalence rates have substantially increased in recent years. Thus, there is an 
imperative need for more cost-effective and scalable mental health treatment 
options, including digital interventions that minimize therapist burden.
OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on a fully automated digital implementation of 
behavioral activation (BA)-a core behavioral component of cognitive behavioral 
therapy for depression. We examine the efficacy of a 1-month fully automated SMS 
text message-based BA intervention for reducing depressive symptoms and 
anhedonia.
METHODS: To this end, adults reporting at least moderate current depressive 
symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10) were recruited online 
across the United States and randomized to one of three conditions: enjoyable 
activities (ie, BA), healthy activities (ie, an active control condition), and 
passive control (ie, no contact). Participants randomized to enjoyable and 
healthy activities received daily SMS text messages prompting them to complete 2 
activities per day; participants also provided a daily report on the number and 
enjoyment of activities completed the prior day.
RESULTS: A total of 126 adults (mean age 32.46, SD 7.41 years) with current 
moderate depressive symptoms (mean score 16.53, SD 3.90) were recruited. 
Participants in the enjoyable activities condition (BA; n=39) experienced 
significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared to participants 
in the passive condition (n=46). Participants in both active 
conditions-enjoyable activities and healthy activities (n=41)-reported reduced 
symptoms of anxiety compared to those in the control condition.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence regarding the efficacy 
of a fully automated digital BA intervention for depression and anxiety 
symptoms. Moreover, reminders to complete healthy activities may be a promising 
intervention for reducing anxiety symptoms.

Behavioural Activation (BA)-a brief therapy based on the scheduling of 
enjoyable, purposeful and rewarding activities-is an effective and 
cost-effective treatment for depression in adults that shows promise for 
children and adolescents. We provide an update on a previous systematic review 
of evidence on BA-delivered in-person, telephone, or online-for depression and 
comorbid anxiety in children and adolescents. We conducted systematic literature 
searches in 6 databases up to February 2024. We included all study designs 
evaluating BA with participants up to 18 years old with diagnosable depression, 
as established by a validated screening tool or diagnostic manual. We used the 
Moncrieff Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess study quality. We 
summarised the findings of all study types with a narrative synthesis and of 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a meta-analysis. Overall, 24 studies (6 
RCTs, 18 pre-post evaluations, n = 2,758) met our inclusion criteria. A 
meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (n = 156) showed that BA has a small effect of 0.24 
(Hedge's adjusted g) in reducing depression symptoms compared to a waiting-list 
control, usual care and other therapies. Online and telephone-facilitated BA was 
shown to be feasible in 3 studies and effective in 1. Outcomes on comorbid 
anxiety were mixed. No economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. BA shows 
sufficient promise as an intervention for reducing depression symptoms in 
children and adolescents to justify the need for further RCTs, providing that 
five conditions are met: studies are powered to detect a minimal clinically 
important difference; BA materials are fit-for-purpose to produce clinically 
meaningful change; follow-ups are longer than 6 months; primary outcomes are 
child-reported; and intervention costs, resource use and adverse events are 
reported.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mental health condition with a significant 
global burden, yet treatment coverage remains limited. Digital interventions 
offer a promising avenue for expanding access to evidence-based interventions.
METHODS: In a three-arm randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of an app-based intervention and an online group cognitive behavioral 
therapy (GCBT) to reduce depressive symptoms compared to a waiting list control 
(WLC). Participants (N=109) with PHQ-9 scores ≥9 were randomized into three 
groups. Informed consent was obtained. The primary outcome, depressive symptoms, 
was assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes 
included anxiety symptoms, loneliness perception, and treatment-related adverse 
effects. We used one-tailed Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, 
adjusting p-values for false discovery rate. Statistical significance was set at 
5%. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05450614.
RESULTS: After excluding dropouts, 58 participants remained (28 app; 19 GCBT; 11 
WLC). Most were women (app: 86%; GCBT: 89%; WLC: 100%) and identified as white 
(app: 61%; GCBT: 63%; WLC: 82%), aged 36 to 39, with high income and education. 
Only GCBT showed a significant reduction in anxiety (t(23.92) = 2.20, p = 0.019; 
padj = 0.038; Cohen's d = 0.81, 95% CI [0.17, ∞). The remaining comparisons were 
not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: While only GCBT showed significant improvement in anxiety symptoms, 
both treatments showed trends toward depressive symptom reduction. High dropout 
rates and a small sample may have impacted results. Further research should 
assess the long-term impact and scalability of digital interventions in mental 
health.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the 
only Food and Drug Administration-authorized prescription digital therapeutic 
(PDT) Somryst versus face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I), or FDA-approved prescription medications for insomnia.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify relevant 
studies. A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to examine (1) 
mean change in insomnia severity index (ISI); (2) proportional change in ISI 
remitters; (3) mean change in wake after sleep onset (WASO); and (4) mean change 
in sleep onset latency (SOL).
RESULTS: Twenty studies provided data on the PDT, CBT-I, CBT-I in combination 
with self-help (SH), or two prescription medications (eszopiclone and zolpidem). 
The PDT was associated with significant mean change in ISI (-5.77, 95% Credible 
Interval [CrI] - 8.53, -3.07) and ISI remitters (OR 12.33; 95% CrI 2.28, 155.91) 
compared to placebo, and had the highest probability of being the most effective 
treatment overall for ISI mean change (56%), and ISI remitters (64%). All 
evaluated interventions significantly outperformed placebo for WASO but no 
significant differences were observed for SOL (five interventions). Sensitivity 
analyses excluding medications and meta-regression (assessing type, duration, 
delivery method for CBT-I) did not affect NMA results.
CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis demonstrated that a PDT delivering CBT-I 
had the highest probability of being most effective compared to face-to-face 
CBT-I, prescription sleep medications, or placebo, as measured by reductions in 
mean ISI score from baseline and ISI-determined remittance.

Plain Language Summary: Chronic insomnia is the long-term inability to fall 
asleep easily or to stay asleep. This condition is much more serious than most 
people realize, raising the risk of many health problems including depression, 
heart disease, and injuries.Although sleep medications are commonly used to 
treat insomnia, these drugs may not be effective and can lead to harms such as 
accidents or clouded thinking. Clinical guidelines recommend a treatment called 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) that is safe and effective. 
Unfortunately, there is a shortage of clinicians trained to provide 
CBT-I.Prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) are FDA-approved software 
programs available on mobile devices such as smartphones. A PDT for insomnia 
(Somryst) delivers CBT-I and can overcome barriers to access for this important 
type of therapy. To compare the effectiveness of this PDT with FDA-approved 
sleep medications and face-to-face CBT-I a special kind of study was conducted 
called a network meta-analysis. This is a statistical method of combining data 
from numerous studies in a way that allows the results to be fairly 
compared.This network meta-analysis of 20 studies found that the PDT was more 
effective at reducing insomnia symptoms than any of the sleep medications 
studied and was even more effective than face-to-face CBT-I as measured by 
scores on a clinically valid scale of insomnia symptoms. These results are 
encouraging because they suggest that digital delivery of CBT-I could help the 
millions of people who currently do not have access to this effective treatment.

BACKGROUND: Family members of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at risk for 
post-intensive care syndrome- family (PICS-F), including symptoms of anxiety, 
depression, and posttraumatic stress. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the 
first-line nonpharmacologic treatment for many psychological symptoms and has 
been successfully delivered by use of mobile technology for symptom 
self-management.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of delivering cognitive behavioral 
therapy through a smartphone app to family members of critically ill patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study with a consecutive 
sample of patients admitted to 2 adult ICUs and their family members. The 
control group period was followed by the intervention group period. The 
intervention consisted of a mobile health app preloaded on a smartphone provided 
to family members. The study time points were enrollment (within 5 days of ICU 
admission), 30 days after admission, and 60 days after admission. Study measures 
included demographic data, app use, satisfaction with the app, mental health 
self-efficacy, and measures of PICS-F symptoms.
RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 49 predominantly White (92%) and female 
(82%) family members (24 intervention, 25 control). Smartphone ownership was 
88%. Completion rates for study measures were 92% in the control group and 79% 
in the intervention group. Family members logged in to the app a mean of 18.58 
times (range 2-89) and spent a mean of 81.29 minutes (range 4.93-426.63 minutes) 
using the app.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results confirm the feasibility of implementing app-based 
delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to family members of ICU patients.

BACKGROUND: Psychological internet-based interventions have shown promise in 
preventing and treating perinatal depression, but their effectiveness can be 
hindered by low user engagement. This challenge often arises from a misalignment 
between technology attributes, user needs, and context. A user-centered, 
iterative approach involving all stakeholders is recommended.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aimed to develop a user-friendly psychological 
internet-based intervention aimed at addressing the symptoms of perinatal 
depression through an iterative, user-centered approach.
METHODS: The development process followed the Center for eHealth Research and 
Disease Management Roadmap phases of contextual inquiry, value specification, 
and design. It involved a comprehensive literature review, 2 surveys, 10 focus 
groups, 5 usability interviews, and 1 technical pilot.
RESULTS: The contextual inquiry revealed a demand for accessible interventions 
for perinatal mental health, with internet-based solutions seen as viable 
options. Insights from the literature influenced intervention content and 
features. Stakeholders' openness to the intervention became evident during this 
phase, along with the integration of the first set of values. Initially, we 
assessed the broader perinatal context to identify the optimal period for the 
intervention. On the basis of the findings and practical considerations, we 
decided to specifically target postpartum depression symptoms. The value 
specification phase further defined the central values and translated them into 
requirements. In the design phase, feedback was obtained on the user experience 
of an early digital prototype and on the prototype's final version. The 
resulting intervention, named Mamá, te entiendo ("Mom, I get you"), is a guided 
web app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles, integrating elements 
from attachment and mentalization theories. It aims to reduce depressive 
symptoms in women during the first months postpartum and consists of 6 core 
sequential modules, along with 3 additional modules, including 5 case examples 
illustrating depressive symptoms and therapeutic techniques. The intervention 
provides homework exercises and offers users the opportunity to receive feedback 
from an e-coach through the web app.
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of a user-centered and 
iterative development process for psychological internet-based interventions. 
This process helps clarify user needs and provides valuable feedback on service 
design and quality, ultimately having the potential to enhance the utility and, 
presumably, the effectiveness of the intervention. The Discussion section shares 
valuable insights from the project, such as the value of the requirement 
sessions.

Serious mental health disorders are increasing among college students and 
university counseling services are often overburdened. Mobile applications for 
mental health have been growing exponentially in the last decade and they are 
emerging in university settings as a promising tool to promote and intervene in 
college students' mental health. Additionally, considering the recent covid-19 
pandemic, mHealth interventions, due to its nature and possibilities, may play 
an important role in these institutions. Our main objectives are to explore 
mhealth interventions in universities, regarding its conceptual framework, 
acceptability and efficacy outcomes and understand its impact and contributions 
to address treatment delivery and psychological difficulties resulting from 
covid-19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in scientific databases, 
namely, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus. A search in app stores was not 
conducted, thus regarding commercially available apps, only those found in our 
database search were included in our review. We selected studies with mobile 
applications addressing psychological interventions for college students. A 
total of 2,158 participants were included in the 8 selected studies and most 
interventions were delivered through mobile apps only and based in cognitive 
behavioral therapy. Results suggested that college students accept and adhere to 
these interventions and preliminary evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in 
different disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression and risky behaviors 
such as alcohol and tobacco abuse and sexual knowledge. We conclude that 
universities, particularly college counseling services, may benefit from mhealth 
interventions, not only to address college students' mental health but to 
decrease some of its difficulties related to lack of human resources. 
Specifically in covid-19 pandemic context, these interventions may contribute 
significantly by promoting and delivering psychological interventions at a safe 
distance.

BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are one of the most common and ever-increasing 
mental health problems among students worldwide. Conventional treatment options, 
particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet- 
and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the 
treatment gap.
OBJECTIVE: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to 
investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help 
smartphone app (MCT & More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, 
acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of 
students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested 
in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward 
internet- and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and 
effectiveness.
METHODS: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and 
randomized to either the intervention group (n=200), who received access to the 
self-help smartphone app MCT & More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list 
control group (n=200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as 
the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) 
and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated 
version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The 
Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure 
attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations 
were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and 
Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing 
Negative Effects of Psychotherapy.
RESULTS: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses 
showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F1,222=3.98; 
P=.047; d=0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: 
F1,220=8.79; P=.003; d=0.40) in the intervention group than in the wait-list 
control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app 
(91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward 
internet- and mobile-based interventions (r=0.260; P=.004) and the more positive 
the outcome expectation (r=0.236; P=.009), the more frequently the self-help 
smartphone app was used.
CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT & More was 
demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list 
control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low-threshold 
intervention to enhance students' health.

University students are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues, with 
anxiety and depression identified as the most common conditions. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-isolation, and difficulties linked to 
online teaching and learning have increased their burden of anxiety and 
depressive symptoms. Thus, the urgent need to intervene in favour of these 
vulnerable subjects, together with the difficulties in delivering in-person 
interventions because of lockdowns and restrictions, has led to prioritize 
digital mental health strategies. This study aimed at systematically reviewing 
the existing literature on digital mental health interventions targeting anxiety 
and depressive symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 emergency. 
Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases identified eight 
randomized controlled trials. Regarding anxiety symptoms, digitally delivered 
cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and mind-body 
practice techniques emerged as valid strategies, while digital positive 
psychology and mindfulness-based interventions showed mixed results. On the 
other hand, digitally delivered dialectical behaviour therapy and positive 
psychology interventions have shown some efficacy in reducing depressive 
symptoms. Overall, the available literature, albeit of low quality, seems to 
support the role of digital interventions in promoting the mental health of 
university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Publisher: Los estudiantes universitarios son particularmente vulnerables a los 
problemas de salud mental, siendo la ansiedad y la depresión las condiciones más 
comunes. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, el distanciamiento social, el 
autoaislamiento y las dificultades relacionadas con la enseñanza y el 
aprendizaje en línea han aumentado su carga de ansiedad y síntomas depresivos. 
Así, la urgente necesidad de intervenir a favor de estos sujetos vulnerables, 
junto con las dificultades para realizar intervenciones presenciales a causa de 
los confinamientos y restricciones, ha llevado a priorizar estrategias de salud 
mental digital. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo revisar sistemáticamente la 
literatura existente sobre intervenciones digitales de salud mental dirigidas a 
la ansiedad y los síntomas depresivos en estudiantes universitarios durante la 
emergencia de COVID-19. Las búsquedas sistemáticas en las bases de datos 
Medline, Embase y PsycInfo identificaron ocho ensayos controlados aleatorios. 
Con respecto a los síntomas de ansiedad, la terapia cognitiva conductual, la 
terapia conductual dialéctica y las técnicas de práctica mente-cuerpo entregadas 
digitalmente surgieron como estrategias válidas, mientras que la psicología 
positiva digital y las intervenciones basadas en el mindfulness mostraron 
resultados mixtos. Por otro lado, la terapia conductual dialéctica y las 
intervenciones de psicología positiva proporcionadas digitalmente han demostrado 
cierta eficacia en la reducción de los síntomas depresivos. En general, la 
literatura disponible, aunque de baja calidad, parece respaldar el papel de las 
intervenciones digitales en la promoción de la salud mental de los estudiantes 
universitarios durante la pandemia de COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Nursing well-being has become a heightened focus since the COVID-19 
pandemic. Nurses are leaving the profession early in their careers or retiring 
sooner than expected. Those who remain in the workforce report higher levels of 
burnout, anxiety, depression, and exhaustion. There is concern that there may be 
a shortage of at least half a million nurses by 2030.
AIMS: This systematic review aimed to investigate the evidence of using a mental 
health promotion mHealth app to improve the mental health of hospital nurses.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, 
MEDLINE with Full Text, Professional Development Collection, Psychology and 
Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sociological Collection, PsycInfo, Embase, and 
PubMed with search dates of January 2012-November 15, 2022. The mHealth 
intervention needed to be asynchronously delivered through a smartphone with 
hospital nurse participants to be included in this review.
RESULTS: Of the 157 articles screened for this review, six were included. 
Primary outcome variables were anxiety, burnout, coping, depression, 
self-efficacy, stress, well-being, and work engagement. Intervention types 
included mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT), stress inoculation therapy (SIT), psychoeducation, and stress management. 
Anxiety, depression, well-being, and burnout improved with MBIs; depression 
improved with CBT; and anxiety and active coping improved with SIT.
LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This review demonstrated promising findings in using 
mHealth apps to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. However, more 
randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes may reveal which type of 
mHealth app and how much exposure to the intervention is more effective in 
improving specific mental health symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up is also 
recommended to study sustainability of the mental health improvements.

BACKGROUND: Available smartphone-based interventions for depression 
predominantly use evidence-based strategies from cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT), but patient engagement and reported effect sizes are small. Recently, 
studies have demonstrated that smartphone-based interventions combining CBT with 
gamified approach-avoidance bias modification training (AAMT) can foster patient 
engagement and reduce symptoms of several mental health problems.
OBJECTIVE: Based on these findings, we developed a gamified smartphone-based 
intervention, mentalis Phoenix (MT-Phoenix), and hypothesized the program would 
both engage patients and produce preliminary evidence for the reduction of 
depressive symptoms.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we evaluated MT-Phoenix in a randomized 
controlled pilot trial including 77 individuals with elevated depression scores 
(Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores ≥5). Participants were either instructed 
to train for 14 days with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist control 
condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured by assessing usage 
data. The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at 
postassessment.
RESULTS: Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention 
group used the smartphone-based intervention for 46% of all days (6.4/14) and 
reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did 
participants in the control condition (F1,74=19.34; P=.001), with a large effect 
size (d=1.02). Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT with AAMT 
may foster patient engagement and effectively target depressive symptoms. Future 
studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 
trial using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to 
active control conditions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line 
treatment for anxiety, but it is not widely available as clinical guidelines 
recommend. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of a novel smartphone-based 
fully automated digital CBT intervention, 'Daylight™', to improve symptoms of 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
METHODS: In this multiple-baseline design, 21 adults (20 F; mean age 43yrs. 
range 19-65yrs.) with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD were randomized to one 
of three baseline durations (2-, 4-, or 6-weeks) and then received access to 
digital CBT. Participants completed daily ratings of anxiety and worry, weekly 
measures of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep, and measures of anxiety, 
worry, wellbeing, quality of life, CBT skill acquisition, and work performance 
at initial assessment prior to baseline randomization, post-intervention, and 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Digital CBT was found to be feasible in terms of engagement, 
satisfaction, and safety. For preliminary efficacy, improvements were detected 
in daily and weekly outcomes of anxiety for most participants. Despite 
individual differences, significant improvements occurred with the introduction 
of digital CBT and not during baseline. Overall, 70% of participants no longer 
had clinically significant symptoms of GAD, 61% no longer had significant 
depressive symptoms, and 40% no longer had significant sleep difficulty at 
post-intervention.
LIMITATIONS: The study sample was recruited using the internet and was mostly 
female, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the feasibility and efficacy of Daylight. Further 
examination in randomized controlled trials is now warranted.

Incorporating Natural Products, Pharmaceutical Drugs, Self-Care and 
Digital/Mobile Health Technologies into Molecular-Behavioral Combination 
Therapies for Chronic Diseases.

Merging pharmaceutical and digital (mobile health, mHealth) ingredients to 
create new therapies for chronic diseases offers unique opportunities for 
natural products such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), 
curcumin, resveratrol, theanine, or α-lipoic acid. These compounds, when 
combined with pharmaceutical drugs, show improved efficacy and safety in 
preclinical and clinical studies of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, 
depression, schizophrenia, diabetes and cancer. Their additional clinical 
benefits include reducing levels of TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines. We 
describe how pleiotropic natural products can be developed as bioactive 
incentives within the network pharmacology together with pharmaceutical drugs 
and self-care interventions. Since approximately 50% of chronically-ill patients 
do not take pharmaceutical drugs as prescribed, psychobehavioral incentives may 
appeal to patients at risk for medication non-adherence. For epilepsy, the 
incentive-based network therapy comprises anticonvulsant drugs, antiseizure 
natural products (n-3 PUFA, curcumin or/and resveratrol) coupled with 
disease-specific behavioral interventions delivered by mobile medical apps. The 
add-on combination of antiseizure natural products and mHealth supports patient 
empowerment and intrinsic motivation by having a choice in self-care behaviors. 
The incentivized therapies offer opportunities: (1) to improve clinical efficacy 
and safety of existing drugs, (2) to catalyze patient-centered, disease 
self-management and behavior-changing habits, also improving health-related 
quality-of-life after reaching remission, and (3) merging copyrighted mHealth 
software with natural products, thus establishing an intellectual property 
protection of medical treatments comprising the natural products existing in 
public domain and currently promoted as dietary supplements. Taken together, 
clinical research on synergies between existing drugs and pleiotropic natural 
products, and their integration with self-care, music and mHealth, expands 
precision/personalized medicine strategies for chronic diseases via 
pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies.

    Digital solutions to promote adolescent mental health: Opportunities and 
challenges for research and practice .

BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation is a major risk for a suicide attempt in younger 
people, such that reducing severity of ideation is an important target for 
suicide prevention. Smartphone applications present a new opportunity for 
managing ideation in young adults; however, confirmatory evidence for efficacy 
from randomized trials is lacking. The objective of this study was to assess 
whether a therapeutic smartphone application ("LifeBuoy") was superior to an 
attention-matched control application at reducing the severity of suicidal 
ideation.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this 2-arm parallel, double-blind, randomized 
controlled trial, 455 young adults from Australia experiencing recent suicidal 
ideation and aged 18 to 25 years were randomly assigned in a 2:2 ratio to use a 
smartphone application for 6 weeks in May 2020, with the final follow-up in 
October 2020. The primary outcome was change in suicidal ideation symptom 
severity scores from baseline (T0) to postintervention (T1) and 3-month 
postintervention follow-up (T2), measured using the Suicidal Ideation Attributes 
Scale (SIDAS). Secondary outcomes were symptom changes in depression (Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder-7, GAD-7), distress (Distress Questionnaire-5, DQ5), and well-being 
(Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, SWEMWBS). This trial was 
conducted online, using a targeted social media recruitment strategy. The 
intervention groups were provided with a self-guided smartphone application 
based on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; "LifeBuoy") to improve emotion 
regulation and distress tolerance. The control group were provided a smartphone 
application that looked like LifeBuoy ("LifeBuoy-C"), but delivered general 
(nontherapeutic) information on a range of health and lifestyle topics. Among 
228 participants randomized to LifeBuoy, 110 did not complete the final survey; 
among 227 participants randomized to the control condition, 91 did not complete 
the final survey. All randomized participants were included in the 
intent-to-treat analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes. There was a 
significant time × condition effect for suicidal ideation scores in favor of 
LifeBuoy at T1 (p < 0.001, d = 0.45) and T2 (p = 0.007, d = 0.34). There were no 
superior intervention effects for LifeBuoy on any secondary mental health 
outcomes from baseline to T1 or T2 [p-values: 0.069 to 0.896]. No serious 
adverse events (suicide attempts requiring medical care) were reported. The main 
limitations of the study are the lack of sample size calculations supporting the 
study to be powered to detect changes in secondary outcomes and a high attrition 
rate at T2, which may lead efficacy to be overestimated.
CONCLUSIONS: LifeBuoy was associated with superior improvements in suicidal 
ideation severity, but not secondary mental health outcomes, compared to the 
control application, LifeBuoy-C. Digital therapeutics may need to be 
purposefully designed to target a specific health outcome to have efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Mental health apps have shown promise in improving mental health 
symptoms, including depressive symptoms. However, limited research has been 
aimed at understanding how specific app features and designs can optimize the 
therapeutic benefits and adherence to such mental health apps.
OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 
avatar customization on depressive symptoms and adherence to use a novel 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health app. The secondary aim is 
to examine whether specific app features, including journaling, mood tracking, 
and reminders, affect the usability of the mental health app.
METHODS: College students were recruited from a university study recruitment 
pool website and via flyer advertisements throughout campus. A total of 94 
participants completed a randomized controlled trial in which they were 
randomized to either customization or no customization version of the app. 
Customization involved personalizing a virtual avatar and a travel vehicle to 
one's own preferences and use of one's name throughout the app. Participants 
completed a 14-day trial using a novel CBT-based mental health app called 
AirHeart. Self-report scores for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress were 
measured at baseline and after the intervention. Postintervention survey 
measures also included usability and avatar identification questionnaires.
RESULTS: Of the 94 enrolled participants, 83 (88%) completed the intervention 
and postintervention assessments. AirHeart app use significantly reduced 
symptoms of depression (P=.006) from baseline to the end of the 2-week 
intervention period for all participants, regardless of the customization 
condition. However, no differences in depressive symptoms (P=.17) or adherence 
(P=.80) were observed between the customization (39/83, 47%) and no 
customization (44/83, 53%) conditions. The frequency of journaling, usefulness 
of mood tracking, and helpfulness of reminders were not associated with changes 
in depressive symptoms or adherence (P>.05). Exploratory analyses showed that 
there were 3 moderate positive correlations between avatar identification and 
depressive symptoms (identification: r=-0.312, P=.02; connection: r=-0.305, 
P=.02; and lack of relatability: r=0.338, P=.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CBT mental health apps, such as 
AirHeart, have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms over a short 
intervention period. The randomized controlled trial results demonstrated that 
customization of app features, such as avatars, does not further reduce 
depressive symptoms over and above the CBT modules and standard app features, 
including journal, reminders, and mood tracking. However, further research 
elucidating the relationship between virtual avatar identification and mental 
health systems is needed as society becomes increasingly more digitized. These 
findings have potential implications for improving the optimization of mental 
health app designs.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a serious, prevalent, recurrent, and undertreated 
disorder in adolescents. Low levels of treatment seeking and treatment adherence 
in this age group, combined with a growing national crisis in access to mental 
health care, have increased efforts to identify effective treatment alternatives 
for this demographic. Digital health interventions for mental illness can 
provide cost-effective, engaging, and accessible means of delivering 
psychotherapy to adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a virtual randomized controlled trial 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a self-guided, mobile app-based 
implementation of behavioral activation therapy, SparkRx, for the adjunct 
treatment of symptoms of depression in adolescents.
METHODS: Participants are recruited directly through web-based and print 
advertisements. Following eligibility screening and consenting, participants are 
randomly assigned to a treatment arm (SparkRx) or a control arm 
(assessment-enhanced usual care) for 5 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome, 
total score on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), is assessed at 
the end of the 5-week intervention period. Additional participant-reported 
outcomes are assessed at baseline, the postintervention time point, and 1-month 
follow-up. The safety of the intervention is assessed by participant report (and 
legal guardian report, if the participant is younger than 18 years) and by 
patterns of symptom deterioration on the PHQ-8, as part of a larger clinical 
safety monitoring protocol. The primary efficacy outcome, total PHQ-8 score at 
the postintervention time point, will be compared between SparkRx and enhanced 
usual care arms using mixed effect modeling, with baseline PHQ-8 and current 
antidepressant medication status included as covariates. Secondary efficacy 
outcomes, including the proportion of participants exhibiting treatment 
response, remission, and minimal clinically significant improvement (all derived 
from total PHQ-8 scores), will be compared between groups using chi-square 
tests. Symptom severity at 1-month follow-up will also be compared between arms. 
Planned subgroup analyses will examine the robustness of treatment effects to 
differences in baseline symptom severity (PHQ-8 score <15 or ≥ 15) and age 
(younger than 18 years and older than 18 years). The primary safety outcome, the 
number of psychiatric serious adverse events, will be compared between trial 
arms using the Fisher exact test. All other adverse events will be presented 
descriptively.
RESULTS: As of May 2023, enrollment into the study has concluded; 223 
participants were randomized. The analysis of the efficacy and safety data is 
expected to be completed by Fall 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the results of this trial will support the 
efficacy and safety of SparkRx in attenuating symptoms of depression in 
adolescents. Positive results would more broadly support the prospect of using 
accessible, scientifically validated, digital therapeutics in the adjunct 
treatment of mental health disorders in this age range.

INTRODUCTION: Scalable psychological treatments to address depression among 
adolescents are urgently needed. This is particularly relevant to low-income and 
middle-income countries where 90% of the world's adolescents live. While digital 
delivery of behavioural activation (BA) presents a promising solution, its 
feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness among adolescents in an African 
context remain to be shown.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a two-arm single-blind individual-level 
randomised controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and 
initial efficacy of digitally delivered BA therapy among adolescents with 
depression. The intervention has been coproduced with adolescents at the study 
site. The study is based in the rural northeast of South Africa in the 
Bushbuckridge subdistrict of Mpumalanga province. A total of 200 adolescents 
with symptoms of mild to moderately severe depression on the Patient Health 
Questionnaire Adolescent Version will be recruited (1:1 allocation ratio). The 
treatment group will receive BA therapy via a smartphone application (the 
Kuamsha app) supported by trained peer mentors. The control group will receive 
an enhanced standard of care. The feasibility and acceptability of the 
intervention will be evaluated using a mixed methods design, and signals of the 
initial efficacy of the intervention in reducing symptoms of depression will be 
determined on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary objectives are to pilot a 
range of cognitive, mental health, risky behaviour and socioeconomic measures; 
and to collect descriptive data on the feasibility of trial procedures to inform 
the development of a further larger trial.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the University of the 
Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee (MED20-05-011) and the Oxford 
Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC 34-20). Study findings will be 
published in scientific open access peer-reviewed journals, presented at 
scientific conferences and communicated to participants, their caregivers, 
public sector officials and other relevant stakeholders.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: This trial was registered on 19 November 2020 with 
the South African National Clinical Trials Registry (DOH-27-112020-5741) and the 
Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR202206574814636).

OBJECTIVE: Being a healthcare professional can be a uniquely rewarding calling. 
However, the demands of training and practice can lead to chronic distress and 
serious psychological, interpersonal, and personal health burdens. Although 
higher burnout, depression, and suicide rates have been reported in healthcare 
professionals, only a minority receive treatment. Concerns regarding 
confidentiality, stigma, potential career implications, and cost and time 
constraints are cited as key barriers. Web-based and mobile applications have 
been shown to mitigate stress, burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among 
several populations and may circumvent these barriers. Here, we reviewed 
published data on such resources and selected a small sample that readily can be 
used by healthcare providers.
METHODS: We searched PubMed for articles evaluating stress, burnout, depression, 
and suicide prevention or intervention for healthcare students or providers and 
identified five categories of programs with significant effectiveness: Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (online), meditation, mindfulness, breathing, and relaxation 
techniques. Using these categories, we searched for Web-based (through Google 
and beacon.anu.edu.au -a wellness resource website) and mobile applications 
(Apple and mobile. va.gov/appstore ) for stress, burnout, depression, and 
suicide prevention and identified 36 resources to further evaluate based on 
relevance, applicability to healthcare providers (confidentiality, convenience, 
and cost), and the strength of findings supporting their effectiveness.
RESULTS: We selected seven resources under five general categories designed to 
foster wellness and reduce burnout, depression, and suicide risk among 
healthcare workers: breathing (Breath2Relax), meditation (Headspace, guided 
meditation audios), Web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MoodGYM, Stress 
Gym), and suicide prevention apps (Stay Alive, Virtual Hope Box).
CONCLUSIONS: This list serves as a starting point to enhance coping with 
stressors as a healthcare student or professional in order to help mitigate 
burnout, depression, and suicidality. The next steps include adapting digital 
health strategies to specifically fit the needs of healthcare providers, with 
the ultimate goal of facilitating in-person care when warranted.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions have shown promise in reducing 
barriers to effective care for depression. Depression and related mental 
disorders are known to be highly comorbid with common chronic physical 
conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. While some research has 
explored the interaction dynamics of treating populations living with both 
mental and physical disorders, very little is known about such dynamics in 
digital care.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week, 
therapist-supported, app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program in improving 
symptoms of depression and anxiety. The studied population included adults with 
a heavy burden of chronic physical disease, including obesity and type 2 
diabetes.
METHODS: A total of 1512 participants with at least moderate depression were 
enrolled. The treatment cohort consisted of 831 (54.96%) participants who 
completed a follow-up assessment. The program included structured lessons and 
tools (ie, exercises and practices) and offered one-on-one weekly video 
counseling sessions with a licensed therapist for 12 weeks and monthly sessions 
thereafter. The clinically validated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) 
and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) were used to assess 
depression and anxiety, respectively. Linear mixed-effects modeling was employed 
to examine changes in depression and anxiety over time. Given correlation among 
various measures of program usage, a composite variable for depth of usage was 
used to analyze the correlation between usage and changes in depressive 
symptoms. Body weight changes from baseline were assessed primarily with 
digitally connected scales.
RESULTS: Out of 831 participants in the treatment cohort, 74.5% (n=619) showed a 
clinically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity after 12 weeks, 
where follow-up PHQ-8 scores had shifted downward by at least one diagnostic 
category. In total, 67.5% (n=561) of the participants showed a reliable 
improvement in PHQ-8 scores as measured by the reliable change index. There was 
an average reduction of 5.9 (SD 5.2) points (P<.001) between baseline and 
follow-up. Greater program usage was correlated with greater likelihood of 
reliable improvement in depressive symptoms (odds ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5; 
P=.002). An exploratory analysis of body weight changes with a multilevel, 
mixed-effect model suggested that reliable improvement in depressive symptoms at 
follow-up was associated with significantly greater weight loss at 9 months 
(β=-1.11, P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide further support that digital interventions can 
support clinically meaningful improvements in depression. Some form of synergy 
in treatment of comorbid depression and obesity or diabetes could be studied in 
future research. The study was limited by postintervention participant attrition 
as well as the retrospective observational study design.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (iCBT) is effective for 
subthreshold depression. However, which skills provided in iCBT packages are 
more effective than others is unclear. Such knowledge can inform construction of 
more effective and efficient iCBT programmes.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of five components of iCBT for subthreshold 
depression.
METHODS: We conducted an factorial trial using a smartphone app, randomly 
allocating presence or absence of five iCBT skills including self-monitoring, 
behavioural activation (BA), cognitive restructuring (CR), assertiveness 
training (AT) and problem-solving. Participants were university students with 
subthreshold depression. The primary outcome was the change on the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from baseline to week 8. Secondary outcomes 
included changes in CBT skills.
FINDINGS: We randomised a total of 1093 participants. In all groups, 
participants had a significant PHQ-9 reduction from baseline to week 8. 
Depression reduction was not significantly different between presence or absence 
of any component, with corresponding standardised mean differences (negative 
values indicate specific efficacy in favour of the component) ranging between 
-0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) for BA and 0.06 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.18) for AT. 
Specific CBT skill improvements were noted for CR and AT but not for the others.
CONCLUSIONS: There was significant reduction in depression for all participants 
regardless of the presence and absence of the examined iCBT components.
CLINICAL IMPLICATION: We cannot yet make evidence-based recommendations for 
specific iCBT components. We suggest that future iCBT optimisation research 
should scrutinise the amount and structure of components to examine.

A Digital Behavioral Activation Intervention (JuNEX) for Pregnant Women With 
Subclinical Depression Symptoms: Explorative Co-Design Study.

BACKGROUND: Digital interventions are gaining increasing interest due to their 
structured nature, ready availability, and self-administered capabilities. 
Perinatal women have expressed a desire for such interventions. In this regard, 
behavioral activation interventions may be particularly suitable for digital 
administration.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to exploratorily investigate and compare the 
feasibility of the internet-based self-help guided versus unguided version of 
the Brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression-Revised, an empirically 
supported in-person behavioral activation protocol, targeting pregnant women 
with subclinical depression symptoms. A user-centered design is used, whereby 
data are collected with the intent of evaluating how to adjust the intervention 
in line with pregnant women's needs. Usability and user engagement were 
evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 11 Italian pregnant women with subclinical depressive 
symptoms based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (scoring<15) participated 
in this study; of them, 6 (55%) women were randomly assigned to the guided group 
(age: mean 32.17, SD 4.36 years) and 5 (45%) to the unguided group (age: mean 
31, SD 4.95 years). The Moodle platform was used to deliver the interventions in 
an e-learning format. It consisted of 6 core modules and 3 optional modules; the 
latter aimed at revising the content of the former. In the guided group, each 
woman had weekly chats with their assigned human guide to support them in the 
homework revisions. The intervention content included text, pictures, and 
videos. Semistructured interviews were conducted, and descriptive statistics 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: Collectively, the data suggest that the guided intervention was better 
accepted than the unguided one. However, the high rates of dropout (at T6: 
guided group: 3/6, 50%; unguided: 4/5, 80%) suggest that a digital replica of 
Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression-Revised may not be feasible in an 
e-learning format. The reduced usability of the platform used was reported, and 
homework was perceived as too time-consuming and effort-intensive. Moreover, the 
6 core modules were deemed sufficient for the intervention's goals, suggesting 
that the 3 optional modules could be eliminated. Nevertheless, participants from 
both groups expressed satisfaction with the content and found it relevant to 
their pregnancy experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings have emphasized both the intervention's 
merits and shortcomings. Results highlight the unsuitability of replicating an 
in-person protocol digitally as well as of the use of nonprofessional tools for 
the implementation of self-help interventions, ultimately making the 
intervention not feasible. Pregnant women have nonetheless expressed a desire to 
receive psychological support and commented on the possibilities of digital 
psychosocial supports, particularly those that are app-based. The information 
collected and the issues identified here are important to guide the development 
and co-design of a more refined platform for the intervention deployment and to 
tailor the intervention's content to pregnant women's needs.

BACKGROUND: Military members (MMs) and public safety personnel (PSP) are 
vulnerable to occupational stress injuries because of their job demands. When 
MMs and PSP transition out of these professions, they may continue to experience 
mental health challenges. The development and implementation of 
resilience-building mobile health (mHealth) apps as an emergent mental health 
intervention platform has allowed for targeted, cost-effective, and easily 
accessible treatment when in-person therapy may be limited or unavailable. 
However, current mHealth app development is not regulated, and often lacks both 
clear evidence-based research and the input of health care professionals.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the evidence-based quality, efficacy, and 
effectiveness of resilience-building mobile apps targeted toward the MMs, PSP, 
and veteran populations via a scoping literature review of the current evidence 
base regarding resilience apps for these populations and an evaluation of free 
resilience apps designed for use among these populations.
METHODS: The studies were selected using a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, 
CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, Academic Search Complete, Embase, and Google 
and were guided by PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A narrative synthesis of the 
resulting papers was performed. The Alberta Rating Index for Apps was used to 
conduct a review of each of the identified apps. The inclusion criteria 
consisted of apps that were free to download in either the Google Play Store or 
the Apple App Store; updated within the last 3 years; available in English and 
in Canada; and intended for use by MMs, veterans, and PSP.
RESULTS: In total, 22 apps met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. The 
resilience strategies offered by most apps included psychoeducation, 
mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance and commitment 
therapy. Overall, 50% (11/22) of apps had been tested in randomized controlled 
trials, 7 (32%) apps had been evaluated using other research methods, and 5 
(23%) apps had not been studied. Using the Alberta Rating Index for Apps, the 
app scores ranged from 37 to 56 out of 72, with higher rated apps demonstrating 
increased usability and security features.
CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth apps reviewed are well-suited to providing resilience 
strategies for MMs, PSP, and veterans. They offer easy accessibility to 
evidence-based tools while working to encourage the use of emotional and 
professional support with safety in mind. Although not intended to function as a 
substitute for professional services, research has demonstrated that mHealth 
apps have the potential to foster a significant reduction in symptom severity 
for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and other mental health 
conditions. In clinical practice, apps can be used to supplement treatment and 
provide clients with population-specific confidential tools to increase 
engagement in the treatment process.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has a severe presentation and chronic course when 
untreated. Although effective BDD treatments exist, most individuals do not have 
access to them. We therefore developed and pilot tested the first 
smartphone-delivered individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for 
adults with BDD. The digital service was developed via user-centered design, 
integrating input from engineering, design, and psychology experts, plus BDD 
patient consultants. We conducted a 12-week open pilot trial (N = 10) to 
describe preliminary results for feasibility, acceptability, and treatment 
outcome. Attrition rates (0%) and feedback on usability and satisfaction 
indicated that smartphone-based CBT for BDD may be feasible, acceptable, and 
satisfactory. Initial results suggest that smartphone-based CBT for BDD may hold 
promise for improving BDD symptom severity, BDD-related insight, functional 
impairment, and quality of life, as scores from baseline to posttreatment 
improved with large-to-very large effects; depression improved with a medium 
effect. Ninety percent of participants were responders at posttreatment and 
3-month follow-up. Smartphone-based CBT for BDD may have strong potential as a 
standardized, low cost, and accessible treatment for this debilitating illness. 
A test of efficacy is merited as a next step, using a well-powered, randomized 
control trial design.

This study examined the effectiveness of the Happy Mother mobile app developed 
for self-management of postpartum depression, based on cognitive behavioural 
therapy. A randomized controlled trial, with a pre- and a post-test design, was 
conducted in South Korea. Effectiveness was analysed using repeated measures 
ANOVA and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. We confirmed that the experimental group 
performed significantly more health promoting behaviours than the control group 
(F = 5.15, p = 0.007). However, there was no significant difference in 
postpartum depression, knowledge of depression, maladaptive beliefs, social 
support, sleep quality, and stress-coping behaviours between the two groups. The 
experimental group's mood score increased by 1.79 ± 2.51 points, resulting in 
significant differences before and after the intervention (Z = -2.81, p = 
0.005). The quality of sleep score in the experimental group increased by 1.48 ± 
1.70 points and was also significantly different after the intervention (Z = 
-3.23, p = 0.001). The activity practice rate of the experimental group 
significantly increased by 30.27 ± 29.27% after using the app (Z = -2.81, p = 
0.005). We found the app to be effective in promoting mothers' health behaviour 
and improving their depressive mood.

BACKGROUND: Paternal perinatal mental health significantly impacts family 
outcomes, yet fathers are often overlooked and underserved in mental health 
services. This study evaluates the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive 
behaviour therapy intervention delivered via mobile app to address paternal 
perinatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.
METHOD: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with perinatal fathers 
experiencing moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms. Participants were 
assigned to either the Rover app mindfulness-based CBT intervention (n = 81) or 
an active control app, moodmonitor (n = 75). Primary outcomes were depression 
(EPDS), anxiety, and stress (DASS21); secondary outcomes included social 
support, parenting self-efficacy, and couple relationship quality. Post-test 
analysis occurred at four weeks, with an additional eight-week follow-up for the 
intervention group.
RESULTS: Contrary to hypotheses, no differences were found between groups for 
depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Both groups showed significant 
reductions in anxiety (intervention d = -1.7, control d = -1.94) and stress 
(intervention d = -2.9, control d = -2.8) and improved couple relationship 
quality. Rover users maintained improvements at 8-week follow-up. Fathers with 
severe baseline depression experienced greater reductions in depression using 
the Rover app (b = 5.36, p < 0.01).
LIMITATIONS: Low adherence to the intervention and moderate attrition over the 
study duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention was acceptable to fathers, treatment 
adherence was low, highlighting the need for more engaging content. App-based 
interventions show potential benefits for paternal mental health, but user 
engagement must be improved. This study contributes to the growing literature on 
digital interventions for fathers' mental health and emphasizes the importance 
of including fathers in perinatal mental health research.

The chapter provides an in-depth analysis of digital therapeutics (DTx) as a 
revolutionary approach to managing major depressive disorder (MDD). It discusses 
the evolution and definition of DTx, their application across various medical 
fields, regulatory considerations, and their benefits and limitations. This 
chapter extensively covers DTx for MDD, including smartphone applications, 
virtual reality interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) platforms, 
artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbot therapies, biofeedback, wearable 
technologies, and serious games. It evaluates the effectiveness of these digital 
interventions, comparing them with traditional treatments and examining patient 
perspectives, compliance, and engagement. The integration of DTx into clinical 
practice is also explored, along with the challenges and barriers to their 
adoption, such as technological limitations, data privacy concerns, ethical 
considerations, reimbursement issues, and the need for improved digital 
literacy. This chapter concludes by looking at the future direction of DTx in 
mental healthcare, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans, 
integration with emerging modalities, and the expansion of access to these 
innovative solutions globally.

BACKGROUND: Depression has become one of the leading contributors to the global 
disease burden. Evidence-based treatments for depression are available, but 
access to them is still limited in some instances. As technology has become more 
integrated into mental health care, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) protocols have become available and have been recently transposed to 
mobile environments (e.g., smartphones) in the form of "apps." Preliminary 
research on some depression apps has shown promising results in reducing 
subthreshold or mild to moderate depressive symptoms. However, this small number 
of studies reports a low statistical power and they have not yet been 
replicated. Moreover, none of them included an active placebo comparison group. 
This is problematic, as a "digital placebo effect" may explain some of the 
positive effects documented until now. The aim of this study is to test a newly 
developed mobile app firmly grounded in the CBT theory of depression to 
determine whether this app is clinically useful in decreasing moderate 
depressive symptoms when compared with an active placebo. Additionally, we are 
interested in the app's effect on emotional wellbeing and depressogenic 
cognitions.
METHODS/DESIGN: Romanian-speaking adults (18 years and older) with access to a 
computer and the Internet and owning a smartphone are included in the study. A 
randomized, three-arm clinical trial is being conducted (i.e., active 
intervention, placebo intervention and delayed intervention). Two hundred and 
twenty participants with moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., obtaining scores >9 
and ≤16 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be randomized to the 
three conditions. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting serious mental 
health problems, or legal or health issues that would prevent them from using 
the app, as well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. 
Participants randomized to the active and placebo interventions will use the 
smartphone app for 6 weeks. A short therapist check-in via phone will take place 
every week. Participants in the delayed-intervention condition will be given 
access to the app after 6 weeks from randomization. The primary outcome is the 
level of depressive symptomatology. The intervention delivered through the app 
to the active condition includes psychoeducational materials and exercises based 
on CBT for depression, while the placebo intervention uses a sham version of the 
app (i.e., similar structure of courses and exercises).
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this study protocol is the first to test the 
efficacy of a smartphone app for depressive symptomatology in the form of a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) that includes an active placebo condition. As 
such, this can substantially add to the body of evidence supporting the use of 
apps designed to decrease depression.

Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent and are associated with considerable 
functional impairment, significant public health costs, and heightened mortality 
risk. Individuals experiencing impairment due to depressive symptomatology are 
most likely to report their symptoms to a primary care provider. As such, 
national guidelines highlight the need to assess and effectively treat 
depression via primary care. Despite these guidelines, the dissemination of 
evidence-based psychotherapy via primary care is limited, likely due to both 
provider- and patient-level treatment barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) 
technologies are promising for addressing these barriers and for promoting 
uptake of evidence-based depression treatment. Among evidence-based 
psychotherapies for depression, brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for 
Depression (BATD) has shown great promise and is particularly amenable to 
mHealth delivery. Herein, we discuss the development of a BATD mobile 
application, Moodivate, that was developed in order to disseminate BATD via 
primary care. This paper focuses on description of (1) rationale for Moodivate 
treatment development, (2) Moodivate treatment components, (3) ongoing clinical 
trial evaluation of Moodivate, and (4) clinical considerations for incorporating 
Moodivate into clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions 
for individuals with a concomitant chronic disease.
DESIGN: We conducted a rapid review of systematic reviews. Two reviewers 
independently conducted study selection and risk of bias evaluation. A 
standardised extraction form was used. Data are reported narratively.
INTERVENTIONS: We included systematic reviews of digital health interventions 
aiming to prevent, detect or manage mental health problems in individuals with a 
pre-existing chronic disease, including chronic mental health illnesses, 
published in 2010 or after.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reports on mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety symptoms 
and depression symptoms).
RESULTS: We included 35 reviews, totalling 702 primary studies with a total 
sample of 50 692 participants. We structured the results in four population 
clusters: (1) chronic diseases, (2) cancer, (3) mental health and (4) children 
and youth. For populations presenting a chronic disease or cancer, health 
provider directed digital interventions (eg, web-based consultation, internet 
cognitive-behavioural therapy) are effective and safe. Further analyses are 
required in order to provide stronger recommendations regarding relevance for 
specific population (such as children and youth). Web-based interventions and 
email were the modes of administration that had the most reports of improvement. 
Virtual reality, smartphone applications and patient portal had limited reports 
of improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital technologies could be used to prevent and manage mental 
health problems in people living with chronic conditions, with consideration for 
the age group and type of technology used.

INTRODUCTION: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is severe, chronic, and 
undertreated. Apps could substantially improve treatment access.
OBJECTIVE: We provide an initial test of the usability and efficacy of 
coach-supported app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for BDD. The 
Perspectives app covers core treatment components: psychoeducation, cognitive 
restructuring, exposure with response prevention, mindfulness, attention 
retraining, and relapse prevention.
METHODS: A randomized waitlist-controlled trial was conducted. Adults (N = 80) 
with primary BDD were assigned to 12 weeks of Perspectives or waitlist. Coaches 
promoted engagement and answered questions via in-app messaging and phone calls. 
BDD severity was measured at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment by 
blinded independent evaluators (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified 
for BDD; BDD-YBOCS). Secondary outcomes included BDD-related insight, 
depression, quality of life, and functioning.
RESULTS: App uptake and satisfaction were high. In intent-to-treat analyses, 
Perspectives app-based CBT was associated with significantly lower BDD-YBOCS 
severity at end of treatment (M [SD]: 16.8 [7.5]) compared to the waitlist (26.7 
[6.2]; p < 0.001, d = 1.44). App-based CBT was associated with greater 
improvements across all secondary measures, with medium to large effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives, supported by a bachelor's-level coach, is an 
efficacious, scalable treatment for adults with BDD.

BACKGROUND: Depression is ranked by the World Health Organization as the single 
largest contributor to global disability. The shortage of health care resources, 
conditions of social distancing during the present pandemic, and the continuing 
need of patients with subclinical depression and in remission for supportive 
therapies, all together motivate a search for new approaches to deliver 
appropriate and timeous treatment for depression.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of 
meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the topic of mobile apps for the 
treatment of depression using the Medline (Pubmed) database during the period 
ending March 30th, 2022. This review was managed following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and 
entailed a search strategy using key-words related to depressive states and 
mobile phone apps for depression treatment and management.
RESULTS: A total of 15 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria for the 
current systematic review. 13 of the 15 studies reported on the effectiveness of 
mobile apps for treating depression, finding a significant reduction in 
depressive symptoms with small-to-medium positive effect size. Patients with 
severe depression experienced greater benefits from a behavioral activation app, 
whereas those with mild depression responded better to a mindfulness app. The 
impact of clinicians' support is difficult to isolated completely from the 
particular interventions' effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile-based intervention apps present a convenient tool for 
prevention and supportive therapy of depression. The use of mobile apps may act 
as an efficient intervention to reduce depression in adult patients regardless 
the potential contributing factors of gender or co-morbidities, but the role of 
mobile apps should be contrasted with other digital interventions.

BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal 
pain, altered bowel habits, and defecation-related anxiety, which can result in 
reduced productivity and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL). 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and 
to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based 
digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided 
CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, 
Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT 
program to individuals with IBS.
METHODS: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were 
recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or 
waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on 
psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress 
management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure 
therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with 
a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, 
and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement 
or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to 
complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life 
[IBS-QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of 
Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal 
Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were 
then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were 
assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment.
RESULTS: Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment 
revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to 
the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains 
were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, 
IBS-QoL, GI-COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment 
group (F1,79=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F1,79=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; 
F1,79=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F1,79=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F1,79=12.13, 
P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by 
the PHQ-9 (F1,79=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F1,79=6.03, 
P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F1,79=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer 
analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on 
HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its relatively benign physical profile, IBS can be an 
extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to 
deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this 
evidence-based treatment.

Mobile technologies can be leveraged to meet the need for evidence-based 
psychological depression treatment via primary care. The purpose of the present 
study was to preliminarily examine the feasibility and efficacy of a self-help 
brief behavioral activation mobile application (app; "Moodivate") for depressive 
symptoms among adults treated via primary care. Participants (N = 52) were 
recruited from primary care practices between January and December 2017 and were 
randomized 2:2:1 to receive (a) Moodivate, (b) an active control 
cognitive-behavioral therapy-based mobile app ("MoodKit"), or (c) treatment as 
usual (TAU; no app). Participants completed assessments of depressive symptoms 
weekly for 8 weeks. App analytics data were captured to examine Moodivate 
feasibility (analytics unavailable for control app). Moodivate participants on 
average had 46.76 (SD = 30.10) app sessions throughout the trial duration, spent 
3.50 (2.76) minutes using the app per session, and spent 120.76 (101.02) minutes 
using the app in total throughout the trial. Nearly 70% of Moodivate 
participants continued to use the app 1 month after trial enrollment and 50% at 
the end of the 8-week follow-up period. A generalized estimating equation model 
examining change in depressive symptoms over time by treatment condition 
indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment condition (χ2 = 
42.21, df = 14, p < .001). As compared to TAU, participants in both app 
conditions evidenced significant decreases in depressive symptoms over time, and 
these treatment gains were sustained across the trial period. These results 
preliminarily indicate feasibility of Moodivate as well as efficacy of both 
Moodivate and MoodKit for the treatment of depression among adults recruited via 
primary care. Future studies should focus on larger-scale examinations of 
treatment efficacy and effectiveness across primary care settings.

BACKGROUND: In the treatment of major depression, antidepressants are effective 
but not curative. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective, alone or 
in combination with pharmacotherapy, but accessibility is a problem.
OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT app as 
adjunctive therapy among patients with antidepressant-resistant major 
depression.
METHODS: A multisite, assessor-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled 
trial was conducted in 20 psychiatric clinics and hospitals in Japan. 
Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression 
and were antidepressant-refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at 
an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1-week run-in in which 
participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session 
of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication 
switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone 
app, called Kokoro-app ("kokoro" means "mind" in Japanese), included sessions on 
self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by 
cartoon characters. The primary outcome was depression severity as assessed by 
masked telephone assessors with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at 
week 9. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory-II 
(BDI-II) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER).
RESULTS: In the total sample (N=164), 81 participants were allocated to the 
smartphone CBT in addition to medication change and 83 to medication change 
alone. In the former group, all but one participant (80/81, 99%) completed at 
least half, and 71 (88%) completed at least six of eight sessions. In the 
intention-to-treat analysis, patients allocated the CBT app scored 2.48 points 
(95% CI 1.23-3.72, P<.001; standardized mean difference 0.40) lower on PHQ-9 
than the control at week 9. The former group also scored 4.1 points (95% CI 
1.5-6.6, P=.002) lower on BDI-II and 0.76 points (95% CI -0.05 to 1.58, P=.07) 
lower on FIBSER. In the per-protocol sample (comfortable with the smartphone 
app, still symptomatic, and adherent to medication with mild or less side 
effects after run-in), the intervention group (n=60) scored 1.72 points (95% CI 
0.25-3.18, P=.02) lower on PHQ-9, 3.2 points (95% CI -0.01 to 6.3, P=.05) lower 
on BDI-II, and 0.75 points (95% CI 0.03-1.47, P=.04) lower on FIBSER than the 
control (n=57). The treatment benefits were maintained up to week 17.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a 
smartphone CBT in the treatment of clinically diagnosed depression. Given the 
merits of the mobile mental health intervention, including accessibility, 
affordability, quality control, and effectiveness, it is clinically worthwhile 
to consider adjunctive use of a smartphone CBT app when treating patients with 
antidepressant-resistant depression. Research into its effectiveness in wider 
clinical contexts is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of 
digital elements and face-to-face psychotherapy-has been proposed to alleviate 
challenges that patients and therapists face in conventional cognitive 
behavioral therapy. There is growing evidence that adding digital elements to 
face-to-face psychotherapy can contribute to better treatment outcomes. However, 
bCBT programs still show considerable shortcomings, and knowledge on how to 
improve digital apps using a bCBT protocol is limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to inductively identify functions and qualities that 
are expected from a bCBT treatment for depression in the eyes of patients and 
psychotherapists who were not currently receiving or practicing bCBT treatment.
METHODS: We used a qualitative exploratory study design and conducted 3 focus 
group interviews (n=6 in each) and 5 semistructured in-depth interviews with 
therapists as well as 11 individual interviews with patients with a primary 
diagnosis of depression and currently undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy 
treatment in Germany. Themes and categories were established inductively from 
transcribed interview records based on a rigorous coding method.
RESULTS: Both therapists and patients expected a digital app to provide patients 
with the opportunity to track their mood, work on therapeutic homework 
activities, easily access an intervention set for harder moments, and 
efficiently facilitate administrative tasks. The desire to be able to customize 
bCBT protocols to individual patient circumstances was evident in both patient 
and therapist interviews. Patients differed with respect to what content and the 
amount of material the app should focus on as well as the method of recording 
experiences. Therapists viewed digital apps as potentially aiding in their 
documentation work outside of sessions. Different attitudes surfaced on the 
topic of data security, with patients not as concerned as therapists.
CONCLUSIONS: Both patients and therapists had substantially positive attitudes 
toward the option of an integrated bCBT treatment. Our study presents novel 
findings on the expectations and attitudes of patients and therapists.

BACKGROUND: Demand for adolescent mental health services has surged in the 
aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and traditional models of care entailing 
in-person services with licensed mental health providers are inadequate to meet 
demand. However, research has shown that with proper training and supervision 
mentors can work with youth with mental health challenges like depression and 
anxiety and can even support the use of evidence-based strategies like cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT). In our increasingly connected world, youth mentors can 
meet with young people on a web-based platform at their convenience, reducing 
barriers to care. Moreover, the internet has made evidence-based CBT skills for 
addressing depression and anxiety more accessible than ever. As such, when 
trained and supervised by licensed clinicians, mentors are an untapped resource 
to support youth with mental health challenges.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and assess the feasibility 
and acceptability of Appa Health (Appa), an evidence-based mental health 
mentoring program for youth experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
This paper describes the development, pilot testing process, and preliminary 
quantitative and qualitative outcomes of Appa's 12-week smartphone app program 
which combines web-based near-peer mentorship with short-form TikTok-style 
videos teaching CBT skills created by licensed mental health professionals who 
are also social media influencers.
METHODS: The development and testing processes were executed through 
collaboration with key stakeholders, including young people and clinical and 
research advisory boards. In the pilot study, young people were assessed for 
symptoms of depression or anxiety using standard self-report clinical measures: 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
scales. Teenagers endorsing symptoms of depression or anxiety (n=14) were paired 
with a mentor (n=10) based on preferred characteristics such as gender, race or 
ethnicity, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) status. 
Quantitative survey data about the teenagers' characteristics, mental health, 
and feasibility and acceptability were combined with qualitative data assessing 
youth perspectives on the program, their mentors, and the CBT content.
RESULTS: Participants reported finding Appa helpful, with 100% (n=14) of 
teenagers expressing that they felt better after the 12-week program. Over 85% 
(n=12) said they would strongly recommend the program to a friend. The teenagers 
were engaged, video chatting with mentors consistently over the 12 weeks. 
Metrics of anxiety and depressive symptoms reduced consistently from week 1 to 
week 12, supporting qualitative data suggesting that mentoring combined with CBT 
strategies has the potential to positively impact youth mental health and 
warrants further study.
CONCLUSIONS: Appa Health is a novel smartphone app aiming to improve the 
well-being of youth and reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms through web-based 
mentoring and engaging CBT video content. This formative research sets the stage 
for a large-scale randomized controlled trial recently funded by the National 
Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research program.

Ecological momentary assessment of affect in context after traumatic brain 
injury.

Author information:
(1)Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute.

PURPOSE: To describe where, with whom, and how time was spent daily, and to 
characterize positive and negative affect, boredom, enjoyment, and perceived 
accomplishment as a function of time, activity, location, and social context, in 
people with chronic moderate-severe traumatic brain injury and 
depression/anxiety.
RESEARCH METHOD: Participants (N = 23) responded to a smartphone app five times 
daily for approximately 2 weeks prior to treatment in a trial of Behavioral 
Activation. The app queried activity and physical/social context; concurrent 
positive and negative affect; and perceived boredom, enjoyment, and 
accomplishment. Descriptive statistics captured time use, and linear mixed 
models were used to analyze relations between affect and contextual factors.
RESULTS: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) response rate was positively 
correlated with integrity of episodic memory and education. Participants spent 
most time at home versus elsewhere, and alone versus with others. The most 
frequent activity was watching TV. Mixed model results based on 17 participants 
with >33% response rate showed that positive affect was associated with being 
outside of home, and with other people; however, socializing was related to 
higher negative affect. TV watching was related to lower negative affect but 
also low accomplishment.
CONCLUSIONS: EMA can provide unique information on the effects of social context 
and activity on mood in TBI. Clinicians should consider negative as well as 
positive affect associated with increasing social participation. (PsycInfo

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
have shown to be efficacious treatment methods for depression. Previous studies 
focused mostly on the outpatient treatment either in group or individual 
setting. The present study aimed at comparing the efficacy of group treatment BA 
vs. CBT, when embedded in inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation treatment.
METHODS: 375 inpatients were randomly assigned to either BA (N = 174) or CBT (N 
= 201). We used established scales for depression such as the Beck Depression 
Inventory II (BDI-II, self-rating), the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (QIDS; expert rating) and the Behavioral Activation for 
Depression Scale (BADS) to assess changes over the course of the treatment and 
at follow-up (4 to 6 months). In addition, we measured disability-related 
functioning with the Mini-ICF-APP, a rating scale built in reference to the 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). 
Multilevel models with repeated measures were conducted to examine the 
differences between groups in relation to change over time with patients' random 
effects.
RESULTS: Both group formats showed substantial reduction in depressive symptoms 
at the end of treatment (d= 0.83 BA vs. d= 1.08 CBT; BDI-II) and at follow-up 
after 4 to 6 months (d = 0.97 BA vs. d = 1.33 CBT, BDI-II; and d = 1.17 BA vs. d 
= 1.09 CBT, QIDS). There were no significant differences between treatment 
approaches. At least 50% symptom reduction was achieved by 53.7% and 54.2% in BA 
vs. CBT respectively. Reported activation levels increased from pre- to 
posttreatment (d = 0.76 BA vs. d = 0.70CBT), while showing loss of increment 
between the end of the treatment until follow up in both formats (d = 0.28 BA 
vs. d = 0.29 CBT).
DISCUSSION: Both modalities led to significant improvement of symptomatology and 
functioning at the end of the treatment and at follow-up, thus for the first 
time demonstrating the practicability of BA in rehabilitation clinics. 
Considering its lower requirements regarding cognitive abilities and its easier 
implementation, BA proved to be a good alternative to other psychotherapeutic 
treatments.

BACKGROUND: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm 
have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide 
first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental 
health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility 
of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded 
conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to 
symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of 
delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with 
moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research 
network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained 
preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability.
METHODS: This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated 
depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait 
list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 
4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on 
acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and 
their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 
PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating 
mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and 
anxiety.
RESULTS: The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a 
wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the 
analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility 
based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female 
(15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 
scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group 
(representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom 
severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in 
symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, 
and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing 
mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for 
individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, 
acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for 
adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of 
PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish 
effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric 
population is warranted. Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically 
disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish 
generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related 
adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric primary care.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, the availability and usefulness of mobile 
self-help mental health applications have increased, but few applications deal 
with COVID-19-related psychological problems. This study explored the 
intervention efficacy of a mobile application on addressing psychological 
problems related to COVID-19.
METHODS: A longitudinal control trial involving 129 Chinese participants with 
depression symptoms was conducted through the mobile application "Care for Your 
Mental Health and Sleep during COVID-19" (CMSC) based on WeChat. Participants 
were divided into two groups: mobile internet cognitive behavioral therapy 
(MiCBT) and wait-list. The primary outcome was improvement in depression 
symptoms. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anxiety and insomnia. The 
MiCBT group received three self-help CBT intervention sessions in one week via 
CMSC.
RESULTS: The MiCBT group showed significant improvement in depression and 
insomnia (allP < 0.05) compared with the wait-list group. Although both groups 
showed significant improvement in anxiety at the intervention's end, compared 
with the wait-list group, the MiCBT group had no significant advantage. 
Correlation analysis showed that improvement in depression and anxiety had a 
significant positive association with education level. Changes in insomnia were 
significantly negatively correlated with anxiety of COVID-19 at the baseline. 
CMSC was considered helpful (n=68, 81.9 %) and enjoyable (n=54, 65.9 %) in 
relieving depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: CMSC is verified to be effective and convenient for improving 
COVID-19-related depression and insomnia symptoms. A large study with sufficient 
evidence is required to determine its continuous effect on reducing mental 
health problems during the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: There is serious concern over the annual increase in depressive 
symptoms among millennials in Bangkok, Thailand. Their daily routine revolves 
around the use of their smartphones for work and leisure. Although accessibility 
to mental health care is expanding, it cannot keep up with the demand for mental 
health treatment. Outside Thailand, multiple projects and studies have attempted 
to merge gamification mechanisms and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to 
create mobile health intervention apps and serious games with positive feedback. 
This presents an opportunity to explore the same approach in Thailand.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the development process of gamifying CBT 
techniques to support game mechanics in a visual narrative serious game, 
BlueLine. The primary target of this research is Bangkok's millennials. In the 
game, players play as Blue, a Bangkok millennial who struggles to live through 
societal norms that influence his digital life and relationships. Through 
in-game scenarios, players will learn and understand how to lessen the impact of 
depressive symptoms via gamified interactions on their smartphones.
METHODS: First, this paper follows each development step of solidifying 
BlueLine's game structure by integrating the Activating Events, Beliefs, 
Consequences, Disputation of Beliefs and Effective New Approaches (ABCDE) model 
and narrative in games. Second, the approach to select CBT and related 
therapeutic elements for gamification is based on suitability to the game 
structure. Throughout the process, CBT experts in Thailand have reviewed these 
scenarios. The approach forms the base of the player's interactions throughout 
the scenarios in BlueLine, broken down into 4 types of gamified mechanisms: 
narrative, verbal interactions, physical interactions, and social media 
interactions.
RESULTS: With the game structure based on the ABCDE model, BlueLine scenarios 
implement gamified mechanisms in conjunction with the following CBT and related 
therapeutic elements: behavioral activation, self-monitoring, interpersonal 
skills, positive psychology, relaxation and mindful activities, and 
problem-solving. In each scenario, players guide Blue to overcome his triggered 
dysfunctional beliefs. During this process, players can learn and understand how 
to lessen the impact of depressive symptoms through gamified interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the development process of gamifying CBT and 
related therapeutic techniques in BlueLine game scenarios. A scenario can harbor 
multiple techniques, including behavioral activation, self-monitoring, 
interpersonal skills, positive psychology, relaxation and mindful activities, 
and problem-solving. BlueLine's game structure does not limit the fact that the 
same combination of CBT elements ties each gamified mechanism.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care professionals experienced 
high levels of depression. However, extant research has not highlighted 
effective internet-based psychological interventions to improve the mental 
health in this population during the pandemic. It remains unclear whether 
self-guided, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs are 
effective in improving the mental health of health care workers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 
smartphone-based iCBT stress management program for reducing the depression 
experienced by nurses in Vietnam and Thailand.
METHODS: From March to April 2022, a 2-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled 
trial was implemented. One arm offered a 7-week self-guided iCBT program, and 
the other offered treatment as usual as a control arm. Full-time nurses were 
recruited from 6 hospitals: 2 hospitals in Vietnam and 4 hospitals in Thailand. 
The primary outcome of this program was the severity of depression measured by 
the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 items. Follow-up surveys were conducted 
to measure the change in depression severity at 3 months (July-August 2022) and 
at 6 months (October-November 2022) after baseline. Mixed modeling for repeated 
measures was used to test the effects of the intervention compared with the 
control for the follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 1203 nurses were included in this study: 602 in the 
intervention group and 601 in the control group. The follow-up rate at 3 and 6 
months ranged from 85.7% (515/601) to 87.5% (527/602). The completion rate for 
the program was 68.1% (410/602). The group difference in depression was 
significant at the 3-month follow-up (coefficient=-0.92, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.18; 
P=.02) and nonsignificant at the 6-month follow-up (coefficient=-0.33, 95% CI 
-1.11 to 0.45; P=.41). The estimated effect sizes were -0.15 and -0.06 at the 3- 
and 6-month follow-ups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the smartphone-based iCBT program was 
effective in reducing depression at the 3-month follow-up among hospital nurses 
in Vietnam and Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect size 
was small, and therefore, these results may not be clinically meaningful.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Provider shortages and other barriers to traditional mental 
health care have led to the development of technology-based services designed to 
enhance access and improve the efficiency and convenience of treatment. We 
reviewed research on computer-assisted cognitive behavior therapy (CCBT) and 
mobile mental health applications to assess the effectiveness of these methods 
of delivering or augmenting treatment, evaluating patient and provider uptake, 
and making recommendations on the clinical use of these tools in the treatment 
of depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: Research on CCBT has found solid evidence for efficacy when the use of 
a therapeutic computer program is supported by a clinician or other helping 
professional. Lower levels of efficacy have been found when CCBT is used as a 
stand-alone treatment. Current CCBT programs have many desirable features; 
however, few of the current programs incorporate services such as artificial 
intelligence that have the potential to help improve communication with 
patients. An increasing number of mobile apps have been created that claim to be 
useful for depression and/or anxiety, yet caution is warranted before using most 
due to limited research on effectiveness, low retention rates, and other issues 
like safety concerns.
SUMMARY: Growth in the development of CCBT and mental health applications for 
depression/anxiety has provided several tools that could enhance treatment 
delivery. A large number of randomized, controlled trials have documented the 
effectiveness of CCBT, while research on mobile apps has been much less robust. 
The advantages and disadvantages of these digital technologies are identified, 
and recommendations are made for clinical use.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of two 
smartphone-delivered treatments: one based on behavioural activation (BA) and 
other on mindfulness.
DESIGN: Parallel randomised controlled, open, trial. Participants were allocated 
using an online randomisation tool, handled by an independent person who was 
separate from the staff conducting the study.
SETTING: General community, with recruitment nationally through mass media and 
advertisements.
PARTICIPANTS: 40 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder received 
a BA treatment, and 41 participants received a mindfulness treatment. 9 
participants were lost at the post-treatment.
INTERVENTION BA: An 8-week long behaviour programme administered via a 
smartphone application. Mindfulness: An 8-week long mindfulness programme, 
administered via a smartphone application.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the 
nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9).
RESULTS: 81 participants were randomised (mean age 36.0 years (SD=10.8)) and 
analysed. Results showed no significant interaction effects of group and time on 
any of the outcome measures either from pretreatment to post-treatment or from 
pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the BA 
treatment was more effective than the mindfulness treatment among participants 
with higher initial severity of depression from pretreatment to the 6-month 
follow-up (PHQ-9: F (1, 362.1)=5.2, p<0.05). In contrast, the mindfulness 
treatment worked better than the BA treatment among participants with lower 
initial severity from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up (PHQ-9: F (1, 
69.3)=7.7, p<0.01); BDI-II: (F(1, 53.60)=6.25, p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The two interventions did not differ significantly from one 
another. For participants with higher severity of depression, the treatment 
based on BA was superior to the treatment based on mindfulness. For participants 
with lower initial severity, the treatment based on mindfulness worked 
significantly better than the treatment based on BA.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a behavioral 
intervention and explore its impact on depression symptom burden among older 
spousally-bereaved adults.
METHODS: Participants were age ≥60 years, bereaved ≤8 months, and at high risk 
for depression. Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of digital monitoring 
of sleep, meals, and physical activity; digital monitoring plus health coaching; 
or enhanced usual care and followed for 9 months for new-episode depression.
RESULTS: We enrolled 57 participants, 85% of eligible adults and 38% of all 
adults screened. We observed high levels of adherence in both digital monitoring 
(90%) and health coaching (92%); 88% of participants were retained. In linear 
mixed-effects models, depression symptoms significantly decreased, but the 
interaction between time and intervention was not significant.
CONCLUSION: A behavioral intervention that uses both digital monitoring and 
motivational health coaching is feasible and acceptable to older bereaved 
adults.

BACKGROUND: There are many different skill components used in cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT). However, there is currently no comprehensive way of 
measuring these skills in patients.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive and brief measure of five main CBT skills: 
self-monitoring, behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, assertiveness 
training and problem-solving.
METHODS: University students (N=847) who participated in a fully factorial 
randomised controlled trial of smartphone CBT were assessed with the CBT Skills 
Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalised Anxiety 
Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the short form of the Japanese Big Five Scale. Structural 
validity was estimated with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA), and internal consistency evaluated with Cronbach's α 
coefficients. Construct validity was evaluated with the correlations between 
each factor of the CBT Skills Scale, the PHQ-9, the GAD-7 and the Big Five 
Scale.
FINDINGS: The EFA supported a five-factor solution based on the original 
instruments assessing each CBT skill component. The CFA showed sufficient 
goodness-of-fit indices for the five-factor structure. The Cronbach's α of each 
factor was 0.75-0.81. Each CBT skills factor was specifically correlated to the 
PHQ-9, GAD-7, and the Big Five Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: The CBT Skills Scale has a stable structural validity and internal 
consistency with a five-factor solution and appropriate content validity 
concerning the relationship with depression, anxiety and personality.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The CBT Skills Scale will be potential predictor and 
effect modifier in studying the optimisation of CBT interventions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in 
certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes 
with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. 
Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general 
anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling 
and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, 
and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive 
appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health 
care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health 
services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health 
applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the 
management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The 
objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and 
management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile 
applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS 
systems.
METHOD: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store 
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 
(PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and 
highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then 
installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy.
RESULTS: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS 
apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues 
including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps 
adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, 
breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also 
showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to 
motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, 
communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline 
availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals 
in their design.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management 
methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large 
numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, 
anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: This study proposes a digital program for the treatment of mental 
illness that could increase motivation and improve learning outcomes for 
patients. Several studies have already applied this method by using an exposure 
and response prevention-inspired serious game to treat patients with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) 
program would be as effective in treating OCD as traditional offline CBT. In 
addition, the treatment efficacy in response to mobile CBT for OCD might be 
associated with increased brain activity within the 
cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) tract.
METHODS: The digital CBT treatment program for OCD, OCfree, consists of 6 
education sessions, 10 quests, and 7 casual games. Information was gathered from 
27 patients with OCD (15 offline CBT and 12 OCfree CBT). During the 6-week 
intervention period, changes in clinical symptoms and brain function activity 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in OCD symptoms and 
depressive symptoms between the two groups. However, the OCfree group showed 
greater improvement in anxiety symptoms compared to the offline CBT group. Both 
offline CBT and OCfree CBT increased the functional connectivity within the CSTC 
tract in all patients with OCD. However, CBT using OCfree showed greater changes 
in brain connectivity within the thalamus and insula, compared to offline CBT.
CONCLUSIONS: OCfree, an OCD treatment app program, was effective in the 
treatment of drug-naïve patients with OCD. The treatment effects of OCfree are 
associated with increased brain connectivity within the CSTC tract. Multisensory 
stimulation by education, quests, and games in OCfree increases the activity 
within the thalamus and insula in patients with OCD.

There is a strong relationship between the symptoms of insomnia and depression, 
however, little is understood about the factors that mediate this relationship. 
An understanding of these underlying mechanisms may inform the advancement of 
existing treatments to optimise reductions in insomnia and depression when they 
co-occur. This study examined rumination and unhelpful beliefs about sleep as 
mediators between symptoms of insomnia and depression. It also evaluated the 
effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on rumination and 
unhelpful beliefs about sleep, and whether these factors mediated the effect of 
CBT-I on depressive symptoms. A series of mediation analyses and linear mixed 
modelling were conducted on data from 264 adolescents (12-16 years) who 
participated in a two-arm (intervention vs. control) randomised controlled trial 
of Sleep Ninja®, a CBT-I smartphone app for adolescents. Rumination, but not 
unhelpful beliefs about sleep, was a significant mediator between symptoms of 
insomnia and depression at baseline. CBT-I led to reductions in unhelpful 
beliefs about sleep, but not in rumination. At the between-group level, neither 
rumination, nor unhelpful beliefs about sleep emerged as mechanisms underlying 
improvement in depression symptoms, however, rumination mediated within-subject 
improvements following CBT-I. The findings suggest rumination links symptoms of 
insomnia and depression and provide preliminary evidence that reductions in 
depression following CBT-I occurs via improvements in rumination. Targeting 
rumination may improve current therapeutic approaches.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and provide the rationale for a randomized controlled 
trial for depression or anxiety after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), which will test 2 treatments based on behavioral activation (BA), a 
promising model to promote both positive mood and increased activity in this 
population.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with masked outcome assessment.
SETTING: Outpatient catchment area of 1 TBI treatment center.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling persons (N=60) with moderate-severe TBI at 
least 6 months prior to enrollment and greater than mild depression or anxiety.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants will be randomized 2:1 into an 8-session treatment, 
behavioral activation with technology, consisting of 6 face-to-face sessions and 
2 via phone, with mood and activity monitoring conducted via ecological 
momentary assessment on a smartphone; or a single session incorporating BA 
principles followed by 8 weeks of activity reminders in the form of 
implementation intentions, delivered as text messages.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (primary outcome); 
Environmental Reward Observation Scale, Behavioral Activation for Depression 
Scale, Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective, Diener 
Satisfaction With Life Scale, Quality of Life after Brain Injury scale, Patient 
Global Impression of Change. Outcomes are measured midway through intervention, 
after treatment cessation (primary outcome), and at 2-month follow-up. A 
treatment enactment interview is administered after the follow-up to ascertain 
to what extent participants continue to engage in activities and use strategies 
promoted during trial participation.
RESULTS: N/A.
CONCLUSIONS: N/A.

BACKGROUND: Post-intensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F) is a constellation of 
adverse psychological symptoms experienced by family members of critically ill 
patients during and after acute illness. Cognitive behavioral therapy delivered 
using smartphone technology is a novel approach for PICS-F symptom 
self-management.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of smartphone delivery of cognitive 
behavioral therapy in reducing the prevalence and severity of PICS-F symptoms in 
family members of critically ill patients.
METHODS: The study had a randomized controlled longitudinal design with control 
and intervention groups composed of family members of patients admitted to 2 
adult intensive care units. The intervention consisted of a mental health app 
loaded on participants' personal smartphones. The study time points were upon 
enrollment (within 5 days of intensive care unit admission; time 1), 30 days 
after enrollment (time 2), and 60 days after enrollment (time 3). Study measures 
included demographic data, PICS-F symptoms, mental health self-efficacy, 
health-related quality of life, and app use.
RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 60 predominantly White (72%) and female 
(78%) family members (30 intervention, 30 control). Anxiety and depression 
symptom severity decreased significantly over time in the intervention group but 
not in the control group. Family members logged in to the app a mean of 11.4 
times (range, 1-53 times) and spent a mean of 50.16 minutes (range, 1.87-245.92 
minutes) using the app.
CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to family members of 
critically ill patients via a smartphone app shows some efficacy in reducing 
PICS-F symptoms.

Introduction Maternal depression (MD), is an overarching term for depression 
affecting pregnant women and mothers for up to 12 months postpartum. Because MD 
may have chronic and long-lasting effects, it is an important public health 
concern. The extent to which telemedicine may be an effective way to provide 
services to sufferers of MD is unknown, therefore, this review aimed to assess 
the available evidence. Methods We conducted a search of The Cochrane Library, 
PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for relevant randomised controlled trials 
published between 2000 and 2018; we then conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis. Results We identified 10 studies for inclusion. Therapeutic 
strategies involved cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural activation 
and other psychoeducation. Eight trials reported significant improvement in 
depression scores post-intervention; four studies that conducted 
post-intervention follow-up found that these improvements continued. However, 
high attrition rates and lack of blinding were common problems. Discussion This 
review found limited evidence supporting the delivery of CBT for the treatment 
of MD and anxiety using telemedicine. However, most of the evidence only studied 
improvements in postpartum depression, indicating that use of telemedicine to 
provide MD intervention is still small and an under-researched area.

We examined the availability and components of internet-based 
cognitive-behavioral therapies (iCBTs) for depression tested in 
randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). The objectives of this literature review 
were to determine the extent to which research-validated iCBTs were available to 
the public, as well as to determine their therapeutic content. A literature 
review of RCTs for iCBTs was conducted on July 30, 2021. For each iCBT, 
interventions were rated by content and compared to commercially available 
smartphone apps. Our search yielded 80 studies using 41 unique iCBTs. Of these, 
only 6 (15%) were completely available to the public, more than half were not 
publicly available (46%), and the remaining 39% were available to the public 
with some restrictions (e.g., those based on the user's geographical location). 
When comparing iCBTs evaluated in RCTs to commercially available smartphone 
apps, we found that iCBTs were more likely to contain psychoeducation, cognitive 
restructuring, behavioral activation, problem solving, and interpersonal 
communication components. iCBTs from RCTs contain evidence-based content but few 
are available to the public. Extending beyond efficacy, attention should be paid 
to the dissemination of iCBTs.

Which Remote Rehabilitation Interventions Work Best for Chronic Musculoskeletal 
Pain and Depression? A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis.

Bobos P, Pereira TV, Pouliopoulou DV, Charakopoulou-Travlou M, Nazari G, 
MacDermid JC.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of remote rehabilitation interventions 
for people living with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression. DESIGN: A 
systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled 
trials. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, and PsycINFO 
databases from inception to May 2023. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized 
controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of remote rehabilitation 
interventions in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression. DATA 
SYNTHESIS: We used Bayesian random-effects models for the NMA. Effect estimates 
were comparisons between rehabilitation interventions and waitlist. We performed 
a sensitivity analysis based on bias in the randomization process, large trials 
(>100 patients per arm) and musculoskeletal condition. RESULTS: Fifty-eight 
randomized controlled trials involving 10 278 participants (median sample size: 
137; interquartile range [IQR]: 77-236) were included. Interactive voice 
response cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; standardized mean difference [SMD] 
-0.66, 95% credible interval [CrI] -1.17 to -0.16), CBT in person (SMD -0.50, 
95% CrI -0.97 to -0.04), and mobile app CBT plus exercise (SMD -0.37, 95% CrI 
-0.69 to -0.02) were superior to waitlist at 12-week follow-up for reducing pain 
(> 98% probability of superiority). For depression outcomes, Internet-delivered 
CBT and telecare were superior to waitlist at 12-week follow-up (SMD -0.51, 95% 
CrI -0.87 to -0.13) (> 99% probability of superiority). For pain outcomes, the 
certainty of evidence ranged from low to moderate. For depression outcomes, the 
certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The proportion of 
dropouts attributed to adverse events was unclear. No intervention was 
associated with higher odds of dropout. CONCLUSION: Interactive voice response 
CBT and mobile app CBT plus exercise showed similar treatment effects with 
in-person CBT on pain reduction among people living with chronic musculoskeletal 
pain and depression had over 98% probability of superiority than waitlist 
control at 12-week follow-up. Internet-delivered CBT and telecare had over 99% 
probability of superiority than waitlist control for improving depression 
outcomes at 12-week follow-up. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(6):1-16. Epub

Mobile apps in mental health have seen a significant growth in recent years. 
Most of them are aimed at treating depression, anxiety, and stress disorders 
using cognitive behavioural therapy methods and relatively few apps are being 
developed to address interpersonal issues. This study tested the effectiveness 
of the iCognito Relationship Program, a self-help application for couple 
relationships based on the chatbot technology. A between-group experimental 
study was conducted in Russia using the bibliotherapy as a control condition 
(N = 58, female sample), with results showing that, after 2 weeks, iCognito's 
users had increased satisfaction, tenderness, constructive communication, as 
well as commitment to the relationship. Also, indicators for relationship 
self-efficacy, communicative skills in relationships, and self-esteem regarding 
relationship skills had significantly increased, while level of conflicts had 
decreased. A medium effect size was reported for most indicators. The 
participants of an experimental group expressed a high level of satisfaction 
with the technology and a generally positive attitude towards the idea of 
working with a "virtual psychologist"-chatbot on their personal issues. Despite 
the need to reproduce the research results, iCognito program demonstrates that 
both mobile application and chatbot technologies can be useful for training 
individuals' relationship satisfaction and communication skills, and that they 
can be more efficient in increasing satisfaction and reducing conflict in 
relationships than self-help books.

crecido considerablemente. La mayoría están orientadas a tratar trastornos de 
depresión, ansiedad y estrés usando métodos de la terapia cognitivo-conductual, 
pero se están desarrollando relativamente pocas aplicaciones para abordar 
problemas interpersonales. En este estudio se evaluó la eficacia de la iCognito 
Relationship Program, una aplicación de autoayuda para las relaciones de pareja 
basada en la tecnología de bots de charla. Se realizó un estudio experimental 
intergrupal en Rusia usando la biblioterapia como condición de control (N = 58, 
muestra femenina), cuyos resultados demostraron que, después de 2 semanas, los 
usuarios de iCognito habían aumentado la satisfacción, la amabilidad, la 
comunicación constructiva y el compromiso con la relación. Además, los 
indicadores de la autoeficacia de la relación, las habilidades comunicativas en 
las relaciones y la autoestima con respecto a las habilidades relacionales 
habían aumentado significativamente, mientras que el nivel de conflictos había 
disminuido. Se informó un tamaño del efecto mediano para la mayoría de los 
indicadores. Los participantes de un grupo experimental expresaron un alto nivel 
de satisfacción con la tecnología y una actitud generalmente positiva hacia la 
idea de trabajar con un “psicólogo virtual” en un bot de charla sobre sus 
problemas personales. A pesar de la necesidad de reproducir los resultados de la 
investigación, el programa iCognito demuestra que tanto la aplicación móvil como 
las tecnologías de bot de charla pueden ser útiles para formar las habilidades 
de satisfacción con la relación y de comunicación de las personas, y que pueden 
ser más eficaces que los libros de autoayuda a la hora de aumentar la 
satisfacción y reducir el conflicto en las relaciones.

而解决人际关系问题的应用程序开发中的相对较少。本研究测试了ICOGNITO这个有关伴侣关系的程序的有效性, 
ICOGNITO是一个基于聊天机器人技术的两性关系的自助应用程序。在俄罗斯进行了一项组间实验研究, 以书信疗法作为对照条件 (N = 58, 女性样本), 
结果显示, 2周后, ICOGNITO的用户在满意度、温柔度、建设性的沟通以及对关系的承诺方面都有所提高。另外, 
关系的自我效能感、人际关系中的沟通技巧以及对关系技巧的自尊都有明显增加, 
而冲突程度则有所下降。大多数指标的效应大小被报告为中等。实验组的参与者对该技术表示高度满意, 并对与 "虚拟心理学家" 
聊天机器人合作解决他们的个人问题的想法普遍持积极态度。 尽管需要再次试验验证研究结果, 但ICOGNITO项目表明, 
手机应用和聊天机器人技术对训练个人的关系满意度和沟通技巧都很有用, 而且在提高关系满意度和减少冲突方面比那些自助书籍会更有效。.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of mental health disorders in Canada is increasing 
with costs of CAD $51 billion (US $40 billion) per year. Depression is the most 
prevalent cause of disability while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the 
best validated behavioral depression treatment. CBT, when combined with 
mindfulness meditation (CBT-M), has strong evidence for increased efficacy. 
While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated online CBT-M 
efficacy, comparisons with in-office delivery are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to assess whether online group CBT-M 
(with standard psychiatric care) is non-inferior in efficacy and more 
cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M at post-intervention and 
6-months follow-up in major depressive disorder. The study will also assess 
whether digitally recorded data (ie, online workbooks completed, Fitbit step 
count, and online text messages) predict depression symptom reduction in online 
participants.
METHODS: This single-center, two-arm, noninferiority RCT employs 
assessor-blinded and self-report outcomes and economic evaluation. The research 
site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto), a research-based 
psychiatry institution where participants will be identified from service wait 
lists and through contacts with other Toronto clinics. Inclusion criteria are as 
follows: (1) aged 18-60 years, any ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory-II 
(BDI-II) of mild severity (score ≥14) with no upper severity limit; (3) 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-confirmed, psychiatric major 
depressive disorder diagnosis; (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed 
by staff psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) receipt of weekly 
structured psychotherapy; (2) observation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) criteria for severe alcohol or substance use 
disorder (in past 3 months), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia (or 
other primary psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, or obsessive-compulsive 
disorder; (3) clinically significant suicidal ideation (imminent intent or 
attempted suicide in the past 6 months); and (4) treatment-resistant depression. 
All participants receive standard psychiatric care, experimental participants 
receive online group CBT-M, and controls receive standard care in-office group 
CBT-M. The online group program (in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc) 
combines smartphone and computer-accessed workbooks with mental health phone 
counselling (16 hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates software interactions (eg, 
secure text messaging and Fitbit-tracked walking). The primary outcome is 
BDI-II, and secondary outcomes are anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression 
(ie, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and 17-item Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), 
quality of life (European Quality of Life Five Dimension), and pain (Brief Pain 
Inventory).
RESULTS: Based on prior studies with the BDI-II and 80% power to reject an 
inferiority hypothesis with a 1-sided type I error rate of 5%, a sample of 78 
per group is adequate to detect small-to-medium-effect sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses online CBT-M efficacy and noninferiority in 
relation to in-person CBT, and the cost-effectiveness of both interventions.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety symptoms are common among university 
students, but many do not receive treatment. This is often because of lack of 
availability, reluctance to seek help, and not meeting the diagnostic criteria 
required to access services. Internet-based interventions, including smartphone 
apps, can overcome these issues. However, a large number of apps are available, 
each with little evidence of their effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of a 
self-guided mobile app, Feel Stress Free, for the treatment of depression and 
anxiety symptoms in students.
METHODS: A web-based randomized controlled trial compared a cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT)-based mobile app Feel Stress Free with a wait-list control. 
University students self-identified as experiencing symptoms of anxiety or 
depression and were randomized to 6 weeks of intervention (n=84) or control 
(n=84), unblinded. The app is self-guided and incorporates behavioral relaxation 
activities, mood tracking and thought challenging, and minigames. Participants 
completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale online at baseline and every 
fortnight.
RESULTS: At week 6, the primary end point, there was evidence that the Feel 
Stress Free app reduced depression symptoms (mean difference -1.56; 95% CI -2.67 
to -0.44; P=.006) but only very weak evidence that it reduced anxiety symptoms 
(mean difference -1.36; 95% CI -2.93 to 0.21; P=.09). At week 4, there was 
evidence to support the effectiveness of the intervention for anxiety symptoms 
(mean difference -1.94; 95% CI -3.11 to -0.77; P=.001) and, though weaker, 
depression symptoms (mean difference -1.08; 95% CI -2.12 to -0.04; P=.04). At 
week 6, 83% (34/41) of participants indicated that they were using the app 
weekly or more frequently.
CONCLUSIONS: The Feel Stress Free app is a promising mobile intervention for 
treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in students and overcomes many of 
the barriers to traditional CBT. Further research is needed to establish its 
effectiveness at and beyond 6 weeks.

BACKGROUND: Attention deficit is a growing problem in adults, and early 
diagnosis and treatment are needed. Previous studies have shown that cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. 
However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, 
and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots 
delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and 
treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a 
short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot 
application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms.
METHODS: This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted 
from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit 
aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only 
control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the 
chatbot application "Todaki," while the latter group was provided with a book on 
managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered 
questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and 
anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The 
post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability, acceptability, and 
side effects.
RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation 
[SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat 
analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of 
attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by 
group-by-time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms 
total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were 
significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots 
were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 
15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total 
score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was 
used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and 
unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the 
mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric 
symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful 
digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided 
management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through 
the large scale randomized controlled trial.

INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has high rates of psychiatric 
comorbidity, and impairs health-related quality of life (HRQL). 
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for IBS, but 
access to treatment remains low. Our proposed solution is a CBT-based smartphone 
app, Zemedy.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial of Zemedy (V.2.0) uses an 
education and relaxation training active control app meant to simulate treatment 
as usual. A target N of 300 participants complete baseline questionnaires and 
consent at screening, and are then allocated to either the immediate treatment 
(Zemedy) or the active control. Treatment lasts 8 weeks, after which both groups 
complete the same battery used at baseline, and the control group is crossed 
over to Zemedy. After another 8 weeks, the crossed-over participants will be 
surveyed once more. Follow-up questionnaires are administered at 3, 6 and 12 
months post-treatment. Primary outcomes include gastrointestinal symptom 
severity and HRQL. Clinically significant change will be defined as 
post-treatment scores falling within 2 SD of the healthy mean. Analysis will 
include intent-to-treat between-groups comparisons, controlling for baseline 
symptom severity, as well as moderation and mediation analyses. We hypothesise 
that the Zemedy app will outperform the active control app in reducing IBS 
symptom severity and improving HRQL.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at the University of Pennsylvania. Results will provide essential 
information on the efficacy and acceptability of an app-based CBT treatment for 
IBS. The data gathered may help establish the Zemedy app as an empirically 
supported intervention for IBS and will assist funding bodies in deciding 
whether to invest in its further development and dissemination. The results will 
be disseminated to patients with IBS via the media and the company website, to 
healthcare professionals via professional training (e.g. webinars and grand 
rounds talks) and to researchers via conferences and publications.

BACKGROUND: The global burden of anxiety and depression has created an urgent 
need for scalable approaches to increase access to evidence-based mental health 
care. The Screening and Treatment for Anxiety and Depression (STAND) system of 
care was developed to meet this need through the use of internet-connected 
devices for assessment and provision of treatment. STAND triages to level of 
care (monitoring only, digital therapy with coaches, digital therapy assisted by 
clinicians in training, and clinical care) and then continuously monitors 
symptoms to adapt level of care. Triaging and adaptation are based on symptom 
severity and suicide risk scores obtained from computerized adaptive testing 
administered remotely.
OBJECTIVE: This article discusses how the STAND system of care improves upon 
current clinical paradigms, and presents preliminary data on feasibility, 
acceptability, and effectiveness of STAND in a sample of US-based university 
students.
METHODS: US-based university students were recruited and enrolled in an open 
trial of the STAND system of care. Participants were triaged based on initial 
symptom severity derived from a computerized adaptive test and monitored over 40 
weeks on anxiety, depression, and suicide risk to inform treatment adaptation 
and evaluate preliminary effectiveness.
RESULTS: Nearly 5000 students were screened and 516 received care. Depression 
and anxiety severity scores improved across all tiers (P<.001 in all cases). 
Suicide risk severity improved in the highest tier (ie, clinical care; P<.001). 
Acceptability and feasibility were demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: STAND is a feasible and acceptable model of care that can reach 
large numbers of individuals. STAND showed preliminary effectiveness on all 
primary outcome measures. Current directions to improve STAND are described.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective at 
treating chronic insomnia, yet in-person CBT-I can often be challenging to 
access. Prior studies have used technology to bridge barriers but have been 
unable to extensively assess the impact of the digital therapeutic on real-world 
patient experience and multidimensional outcomes. Among patients with insomnia, 
our aim is to determine the impact of a prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) 
(PEAR-003b, FDA-authorised as Somryst; herein called PDT) that provides 
mobile-delivered CBT-I on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and healthcare 
utilisation.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a pragmatically designed, prospective, 
multicentre randomised controlled trial that leverages Hugo, a unique 
patient-centred health data-aggregating platform for data collection and patient 
follow-up from Hugo Health. A total of 100 participants with insomnia from two 
health centres will be enrolled onto the Hugo Health platform, provided with a 
linked Fitbit (Inspire 2) to track activity and then randomised 1:1 to receive 
(or not) the PDT for mobile-delivered CBT-I (Somryst). The primary outcome is a 
change in the insomnia severity index score from baseline to 9-week 
postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilisation, health 
utility scores and clinical outcomes; change in sleep outcomes as measured with 
sleep diaries and a change in individual PROs including depressive symptoms, 
daytime sleepiness, health status, stress and anxiety. For those allocated to 
the PDT, we will also assess engagement with the PDT.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Boards at Yale University and 
the Mayo Clinic have approved the trial protocol. This trial will provide 
important data to patients, clinicians and policymakers about the impact of the 
PDT device delivering CBT-I on PROs, clinical outcomes and healthcare 
utilisation. Findings will be disseminated to participants, presented at 
professional meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: The integration of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression 
(BAT-D) into smoking cessation interventions is a promising approach to address 
depression as a barrier to quitting. However, this approach has only been tested 
as a face-to-face intervention, which has low reach.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to develop a BAT-D mobile health app with 
high potential reach and determine its feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary effects on theory-based behavioral processes of behavioral 
activation, reduced depressive symptoms, and smoking cessation.
METHODS: Following a user-centered design process consisting of competitive 
analysis, focus groups, and prototype testing, we conducted a single-arm pilot 
trial of Actify!, a BAT-D app for depressed smokers. Participants used 
SmokefreeTXT along with Actify! to provide cessation content that had not yet 
been built into the app for this initial phase of pilot testing. Participants in 
the trial were current, daily smokers with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. 
We examined use outcomes for all enrolled participants and process and cessation 
outcomes at 6 weeks postenrollment for study completers (16/17, 94% retention).
RESULTS: Regarding acceptability, average number of log-ins per participant was 
16.6 (SD 13.7), and 63% (10/16) reported being satisfied overall with the app. 
Posttreatment interviews identified some usability challenges (eg, high 
perceived burden of planning and scheduling values-based activities). There was 
a significant decrease in depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up (mean 
change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores was -4.5, 95% CI -7.7 to -1.3; 
P=.01). Additionally, carbon monoxide (CO)-confirmed, 7-day point prevalence 
abstinence (PPA) at 6-week follow-up was 31% (5/16), and the 30-day PPA was 19% 
(3/16).
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate promising engagement with Actify! and potential 
for impact on theory-based change processes and cessation outcomes. Preliminary 
quit rates compare favorably to previous trials of smoking cessation apps for 
the general population (ie, short-term, self-reported 30-day quit rates in the 
8% to 18% range) and a previous trial of face-to-face BAT-D for depressed 
smokers (ie, CO-confirmed, 7-day PPA rate of 17% at end of treatment).

BACKGROUND: Rates of depression are increasing among adolescents. A novel way to 
reduce depression is by improving sleep. We evaluated whether an app-based 
intervention for insomnia improved sleep and depression, and whether changes in 
insomnia mediated changes in depression.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm single-blind randomised controlled trial at the 
Black Dog Institute in Australia. Adolescents 12-16 years experiencing insomnia 
symptoms were randomly allocated to receive Sleep Ninja, an app-delivered 
cognitive behavioural therapy program for insomnia, or to an active control 
group involving weekly text message sleep tips. Assessments took place at 
baseline, 6 weeks (post-intervention) and 14 weeks (post-baseline). Co-primary 
outcomes were symptoms of insomnia and depression at post-intervention (primary 
endpoint). Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted. The trial is registered with 
the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12619001462178.
RESULTS: Between October 25, 2019, and September 6, 2020, 264 participants were 
randomised to receive Sleep Ninja (n = 131) or to the control group (n = 133). 
Relative to the control group, those allocated to the intervention reported a 
greater reduction in insomnia symptoms at 6 weeks (95% CI: -2.96 to -0.41, 
d = .41) and 14 weeks (95% CI: -3.34 to -0.19, d = .39), and a greater reduction 
in depression symptoms at 6 weeks (95% CI: -3.46 to -0.56, d = .28) but not 
14 weeks (p < 1). Change in insomnia mediated change in depression. No adverse 
events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: An app-delivered program for insomnia could be a practical, 
non-stigmatising and scalable way to reduce symptoms of insomnia and depression 
among adolescents experiencing difficulties getting enough good quality sleep.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA), either as a stand-alone treatment or as 
part of cognitive behavioral therapy, has been shown to be effective for 
treating depression. The theoretical underpinnings of BA derive from Lewinsohn 
et al's theory of depression. The central premise of BA is that having patients 
engage in more pleasant activities leads to them experiencing more pleasure and 
elevates their mood, which, in turn, leads to further (behavioral) activation. 
However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence about the theoretical framework 
of BA.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the assumed (temporal) associations of the 
3 constructs in the theoretical framework of BA.
METHODS: Data were collected as part of the "European Comparative Effectiveness 
Research on Internet-based Depression Treatment versus treatment-as-usual" trial 
among patients who were randomly assigned to receive blended cognitive 
behavioral therapy (bCBT). As part of bCBT, patients completed weekly 
assessments of their level of engagement in pleasant activities, the pleasure 
they experienced as a result of these activities, and their mood over the course 
of the treatment using a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 
application. Longitudinal cross-lagged and cross-sectional associations of 240 
patients were examined using random intercept cross-lagged panel models.
RESULTS: The analyses did not reveal any statistically significant cross-lagged 
coefficients (all P>.05). Statistically significant cross-sectional positive 
associations between activities, pleasure, and mood levels were identified. 
Moreover, the levels of engagement in activities, pleasure, and mood slightly 
increased over the duration of the treatment. In addition, mood seemed to carry 
over, over time, while both levels of engagement in activities and pleasurable 
experiences did not.
CONCLUSIONS: The results were partially in accordance with the theoretical 
framework of BA, insofar as the analyses revealed cross-sectional relationships 
between levels of engagement in activities, pleasurable experiences deriving 
from these activities, and enhanced mood. However, given that no statistically 
significant temporal relationships were revealed, no conclusions could be drawn 
about potential causality. A shorter measurement interval (eg, daily rather than 
weekly EMA reports) might be more attuned to detecting potential underlying 
temporal pathways. Future research should use an EMA methodology to further 
investigate temporal associations, based on theory and how treatments are 
presented to patients.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that digital mental health 
intervention (Wysa for Chronic Pain) can improve mental and physical health in 
people with chronic musculoskeletal pain and coexisting symptoms of depression 
or anxiety. However, the behavioral mechanisms through which this intervention 
acts are not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify behavioral mechanisms that 
may mediate changes in mental and physical health associated with use of Wysa 
for Chronic Pain during orthopedic management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. 
We hypothesized that improved behavioral activation, pain acceptance, and sleep 
quality mediate improvements in self-reported mental and physical health.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort, pilot mediation analysis, adults with 
chronic (≥3 months) neck or back pain received the Wysa for Chronic Pain digital 
intervention, which uses a conversational agent and text-based access to human 
counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and related therapeutic 
content. Patient-reported outcomes and proposed mediators were collected at 
baseline and 1 month. The exposure of interest was participants' engagement (ie, 
total interactions) with the digital intervention. Proposed mediators were 
assessed using the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form, 
Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, and Athens Insomnia Scale. Outcomes 
included Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety, 
Depression, Pain Interference, and Physical Function scores. A mediation 
analysis was conducted using the Baron and Kenny method, adjusting for age, sex, 
and baseline mediators and outcome values. P<.20 was considered significant for 
this pilot study.
RESULTS: Among 30 patients (mean age 59, SD 14, years; 21 [70%] female), the 
mediation effect of behavioral activation on the relationship between increased 
intervention engagement and improved anxiety symptoms met predefined statistical 
significance thresholds (indirect effect -0.4, 80% CI -0.7 to -0.1; P=.13, 45% 
of the total effect). The direction of mediation effect was generally consistent 
with our hypothesis for all other proposed mediator or outcome relationships, as 
well.
CONCLUSIONS: In a full-sized randomized controlled trial of patients with 
chronic musculoskeletal pain, behavioral activation, pain acceptance, and sleep 
quality may play an important role in mediating the relationship between use of 
a digital mental health intervention (Wysa for Chronic Pain) and improved mental 
and physical health.

MoodHacker Mobile Web App With Email for Adults to Self-Manage Mild-to-Moderate 
Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of 
disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of disability by 
2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US 
$210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50% of these costs in productivity 
loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression never 
receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can 
be more widely disseminated through new channels, such as employee assistance 
programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face 
care.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker 
mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills 
in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that 
MoodHacker users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative 
cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge of depression, and 
functioning in the workplace.
METHODS: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 
employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression. Participants were 
recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and 
with outreach through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. 
Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within 
each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker 
intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites 
on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online 
self-assessment surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after 
baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, 
(3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) 
user satisfaction and usability. After randomization, all interactions with 
subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to 
subjects reporting current suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms.
RESULTS: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, 
behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work productivity, work 
absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on 
depression symptoms, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for 
those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these outcome 
measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used 
the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 
1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant 
effects on work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app 
produced significant effects on depression symptoms (partial eta(2) = .021) 
among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access 
to relevant depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for 
individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the 
MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as 
the mediating factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge 
of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week 
follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up 
underscores the importance of extending program contacts to maintain user 
engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions 
like MoodHacker may be appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar 
environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with 
guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person 
support.

helpful. However, little is known about the adequacy of CA responses. This study 
assessed the structure, content, and user-customization of mental health CA 
dialogues with users with depression or at risk of suicide.
METHODS: We used content analysis to examine the dialogues of CAs previously 
included in three assessments of mental health apps (depression education, 
self-guided cognitive behavioural therapy, and suicide prevention) performed 
between 2019 and 2020. Two standardized user personas with depression were 
developed to interact with the CA. All conversations were saved as screenshots, 
transcribed verbatim, and coded inductively.
RESULTS: Nine CAs were included. Seven CAs (78%) had Android and iOS versions; 
five CAs (56%) had at least 500,000 downloads. The analysis generated eight 
categories: self-introduction, personalization, appropriateness of CA responses, 
conveying empathy, guiding users through mood-boosting activities, mood 
monitoring, suicide risk management, and others. CAs could engage in empathic, 
non-judgemental conversations with users, offer support, and guide 
psychotherapeutic exercises.
LIMITATIONS: CA evaluations were performed using standardized personas, not 
real-world users. CAs were included for evaluation only if retrieved in the 
search strategies associated with the previous assessment studies.
CONCLUSION: Assessed CAs offered anonymous, empathic, non-judgemental 
interactions that align with evidence for face-to-face psychotherapy. CAs from 
app stores are not suited to provide comprehensive suicide risk management. 
Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of CA-led interventions in 
mental health care and in enhancing suicide risk management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) programs have been 
proposed to increase the acceptance and adoption of digital therapeutics (DTx) 
such as digital health apps. These programs allow for more personalized care by 
combining regular face-to-face therapy sessions with DTx. However, facilitators 
of and barriers to the use of DTx in bCBT programs have rarely been examined 
among students, who are particularly at risk for developing symptoms of 
depression and anxiety disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the facilitators of and barriers to the 
use of a bCBT program with the elona therapy app among university students with 
mild to moderate depression or anxiety symptoms.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted via videoconference between 
January 2022 and April 2022 with 102 students (mean age 23.93, SD 3.63 years; 
89/102, 87.2% female) from universities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, 
after they had completed weekly individual cognitive behavioral therapy sessions 
(25 minutes each) via videoconference for 6 weeks and regularly used the 
depression (n=67, 65.7%) or anxiety (n=35, 34.3%) module of the app. The 
interviews were coded based on grounded theory.
RESULTS: Many participants highlighted the intuitive handling of the app and 
indicated that they perceived it as a supportive tool between face-to-face 
sessions. Participants listed other benefits, such as increased self-reflection 
and disorder-specific knowledge as well as the transfer of the content of 
therapy sessions into their daily lives. Some stated that they would have 
benefited from more personalized and interactive tasks. In general, participants 
mentioned the time requirement, increased use of the smartphone, and the feeling 
of being left alone with potentially arising emotions while working on tasks for 
the next therapy session as possible barriers to the use of the app. Data 
security was not considered a major concern.
CONCLUSIONS: Students mostly had positive attitudes toward elona therapy as part 
of the bCBT program. Our study shows that DTx complementing face-to-face therapy 
sessions can be perceived as a helpful tool for university students with mild to 
moderate anxiety or depression symptoms in their daily lives. Future research 
could elaborate on whether bCBT programs might also be suitable for students 
with more severe symptoms of mental disorders. In addition, the methods by which 
such bCBT programs could be incorporated into the university context to reach 
students in need of psychological support should be explored.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence for digital interventions to improve 
sleep shows promising effects. The interventions investigated so far have been 
primarily web-based; however, app-based interventions may reach a wider audience 
and be more suitable for daily use.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the intervention effects, adherence, and 
acceptance of an unguided app-based intervention for individuals who wish to 
improve their sleep.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an 
app-based short intervention (Refresh) to improve sleep compared with a waitlist 
condition. Refresh is an 8-week unguided intervention covering the principles of 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and including a sleep diary. 
The primary outcome was sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) as self-assessed by 
the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS). The secondary outcomes were depression 
(9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score) and perceived 
insomnia-related impairment.
RESULTS: We included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at 
baseline. About 1 in 3 participants who were allocated to the intervention group 
never accessed the intervention. Active participants completed on average 4 out 
of 8 chapters. Retention rates were 67.4% (n=250) at postassessment and 57.7% 
(n=214) at the 6-month follow-up. At postintervention, insomnia symptoms in the 
intervention group had improved more than those in the waitlist group, with a 
small effect (d=0.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=0.45) in the 
subgroup with poor sleep. Effects in the intervention group were maintained at 
follow-up. Perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre- to 
postassessment. No significant intervention effect on depression was detected. 
Working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good.
CONCLUSIONS: An app-based, unguided intervention is a feasible and effective 
option to scale-up CBT-I-based treatment, but intervention uptake and adherence 
need to be carefully addressed.

University, Daegu, South Korea.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions are being widely tried because of their 
attractive advantages. However, there is not enough evidence for its 
effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of mobile app-based stress 
management intervention (mSMI) on highly stressed workers.
METHODS: A sample of 82 white-collar workers with elevated symptoms of perceived 
stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10≥22) were randomly assigned to the intervention 
or control group. The mSMI consisted of three modules: self-management including 
a work diary, counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy and interventions 
focused on music, meditation, relaxation and image healings. Self-report data 
were collected at the baseline and post-intervention. Study outcomes analyzed 
perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and work engagement. Data were assessed 
using analysis of covariance with covariates.
RESULTS: There was significantly reduced perceived stress from baseline to 6 
weeks in mSMI (t = 5.788, p < 0.001) and control group (t = 3.184, p = 0.003). 
After adjusting for covariates, the between-group difference in the perceived 
stress was significantly different (F = 4.051, p = 0.048); however, the effect 
size was small. There was no significant intervention effect on anxiety, 
depression, and work engagement. The process evaluation indicated that most 
participants (85.3%) were satisfied with the intervention and their mental 
health benefited.
CONCLUSION: This study found that mobile health intervention facilitated 
perceived stress management for highly stressed workers. Further studies should 
address job-related outcomes and mental health symptoms in workers by applying 
the latest information technology and addressing the limitations of mobile 
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Depression is a leading cause of human disability. 
Telemedicine-based interventions using text messaging are currently being 
trialled for the management of community-based clients with clinical depression. 
However, little is known about the effectiveness of such methods.
METHODS: We searched the databases PubMed, Embase, Informit, Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and Scopus for randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and April 2019. Studies comparing 
text messaging interventions to a comparator group for patients with depression 
were included in the review. Articles were assessed for quality using the Joanna 
Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for RCTs.
RESULTS: Nine RCTs (945 patients: 764 adults and 181 adolescents) were included 
in the systematic review. Five studies used text messaging as the only 
intervention, whilst the remaining combined text messaging with other treatment 
modalities such as behavioural activation or cognitive behavioural therapy. A 
meta-analysis was conducted on seven selected RCTs (845 patients: 664 adults and 
181 adolescents). The standardised mean reduction in depression due to text 
messaging interventions was 0.23 (95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.48). There 
was evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect between studies.
DISCUSSION: There is marginal evidence supporting text messaging interventions 
as an effective treatment modality for people living with clinical depression. 
However, further research is needed to determine how best to utilise 
text-message interventions alongside other conventional forms of health services 
delivery.

BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subthreshold PTSD are still 
major global concerns, especially in developing areas short of mental health 
resources. Written exposure therapy (WET), a brief 5-session treatment, has been 
found to be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms, but no studies have examined it 
in an Eastern context. Mindfulness-based meditation mobile application may be a 
promising approach to reduce insomnia comorbid with PTSD. The current study aims 
to: 1) examine the effectiveness of WET for Chinese PTSD and subthreshold PTSD 
patients, and 2) examine the effectiveness of adding a mindfulness-based 
application (MBA) to WET for reducing comorbid insomnia.
METHODS: The randomized controlled trial will enroll 150 adults with 
subthreshold/full PTSD and comorbid insomnia. Participants will be randomly 
assigned to written exposure therapy plus mindfulness-based application 
condition (WET + MBA, n = 50), written exposure therapy alone (WET, n = 50), or 
minimal contact control (MMC, n = 50). Clinical interview of the primary outcome 
(PTSD symptoms) will be administrated at baseline, posttreatment, 3- and 6- 
month follow-up, while self-reported PTSD symptoms and secondary outcomes 
(insomnia severity) will be administrated at baseline, every week and all 
follow-ups.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study applying WET in Chinese PTSD patients, as 
well as examining a mindfulness-based mobile application as a treatment add-on 
for comorbid insomnia. Study findings will contribute to the knowledge of the 
effectiveness of WET and a mindfulness-based mobile application, and the 
development of a culture-adapted treatment protocol.

AbstractIntroduction: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is prevalent among 
college students. Smartphone-based interventions may be a low-cost treatment 
method. Method: College students with self-reported GAD were randomized to 
receive smartphone-based guided self-help (n = 50), or no treatment (n = 50). 
Post-treatment and six-month follow-up outcomes included the Depression Anxiety 
Stress Scales-Short Form Stress Subscale (DASS Stress), the Penn State Worry 
Questionnaire (PSWQ-11), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T), 
as well as diagnostic status assessed by the GAD-Questionnaire, 4th edition. 
Results: From pre- to post-treatment, participants who received guided self-help 
(vs. no treatment) experienced significantly greater reductions on the DASS 
Stress (d = -0.408) and a greater probability of remission from GAD 
(d = -0.445). There was no significant between-group difference in change on the 
PSWQ-11 (d = -0.208) or STAI-T (d = -0.114). From post to six-month follow-up 
there was no significant loss of gains on DASS Stress scores (d = -0.141) and of 
those who had remitted, 78.6% remained remitted. Yet rates of remitted 
participants no longer differed significantly between conditions at follow-up 
(d = -0.229). Conclusion: Smartphone-based interventions may be efficacious in 
treating some aspects of GAD. Methods for improving symptom reduction and 
long-term outcome are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and debilitating 
condition. First-line treatments include antidepressants and 
cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT). However, several patients present 
treatment-resistance and/or adverse effects. Transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive neuromodulation technique, is an effective 
alternative for MDD.
AREAS COVERED: We hereby review a portable tDCS device designed to be combined 
with a cognitive-behavioral intervention. This home-use device was developed by 
Flow Neuroscience™ and was recently approved in the UK and European Union. We 
discuss present evidence on tDCS efficacy and safety, both as a monotherapy and 
as a combined treatment. Moreover, we show a computer modeling tDCS procedure 
based on Flow parameters and montage.
EXPERT OPINION: Electric field simulations revealed that Flow's tDCS device 
targets prefrontal cortical areas involved in MDD pathophysiology. In addition, 
the safety and efficacy profile revealed from prior tDCS studies support its use 
in depression. Finally, combining tDCS with cognitive-behavioral interventions 
might further enhance overall efficacy, although this aspect should be 
investigated in upcoming randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that Internet-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy (ICBT) is as effective as a stand-alone treatment and helps facilitating 
access to treatment. Given the complexity of the treatment, we argue that the 
effect of ICBT could be even greater if guided by a therapist, as this could 
increase treatment adherence. We modified an established and well-evaluated 
treatment approach and developed a mobile application for treating social 
anxiety disorder (SAD). In the present study, we compare the efficacy of app use 
alone (APP) with video-based, therapist-guided app use (TG-APP) and with a 
wait-list control group (WLC) in terms of symptom reduction, and various 
secondary outcomes such as increase in quality of life or decrease of general 
psychological distress.
METHODS/DESIGN: A within-between interaction design with randomization to one of 
three conditions will be used. In the APP condition, patients receive only the 
app without any additional contact with therapists, while in the TG-APP 
condition, therapists provide 8 sessions of video-based treatment in addition to 
using the app. The study will be conducted in two university outpatient 
treatment centers with reliably diagnosed SAD patients. The primary outcome will 
be defined as change in SAD symptoms, as measured by the Liebowitz Social 
Anxiety Scale (expert rating). Furthermore, a wide range of self-reports and 
clinician ratings for other symptoms (depression, general psychopathology) or 
quality of life will be used. A simulation-based power analysis for a 3 × 2 
interaction effect (group × time) on the primary outcome in a linear mixed model 
resulted in a total sample size of N = 165.
DISCUSSION: The present study will be one of the first to examine the additional 
benefit of therapist-guided video sessions regarding the use of an app treating 
SAD. Study results are pivotal to future treatment application in SAD.

Internet and smartphone addiction have become important social issues. Various 
studies have demonstrated their association with clinical and psychological 
factors, including depression, anxiety, aggression, anger expression, and 
behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation systems. However, these two 
addictions are also highly correlated with each other, so the consideration of 
the relationship between internet and smartphone addiction can enhance the 
analysis. In this study, we considered the copula regression model to regress 
the bivariate addictions on clinical and psychological factors. Real data 
analysis with 555 students (age range: 14-15 years; males, N = 295; females, N = 
265) from South Korean public middle schools is illustrated. By fitting the 
copula regression model, we investigated the dependency between internet and 
smartphone addiction and determined the risk factors associated with the two 
addictions. Furthermore, by comparing the model fits of the copula model with 
linear regression and generalized linear models, the best copula model was 
proposed in terms of goodness of fit. Our findings revealed that internet and 
smartphone addiction are not separate problems, and that associations between 
them should be considered. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, the 
behavioral inhibition system, and aggression were also significantly associated 
with both addictions, while ADHD symptoms were related to internet addiction 
only. We emphasize the need to establish policies on the prevention, management, 
and education of addiction.

Examining the Effectiveness of Gamification in Mental Health Apps for 
Depression: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Previous research showed that computerized cognitive behavioral 
therapy can effectively reduce depressive symptoms. Some mental health apps 
incorporate gamification into their app design, yet it is unclear whether 
features differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms over and 
above mental health apps without gamification.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether mental health apps 
with gamification elements differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive 
symptoms when compared to those that lack these elements.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of app-based 
therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment 
therapy, and mindfulness, on depressive symptoms was performed. A total of 5597 
articles were identified via five databases. After screening, 38 studies (n=8110 
participants) remained for data extraction. From these studies, 50 total 
comparisons between postintervention mental health app intervention groups and 
control groups were included in the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A random effects model was performed to examine the effect of mental 
health apps on depressive symptoms compared to controls. The number of 
gamification elements within the apps was included as a moderator. Results 
indicated a small to moderate effect size across all mental health apps in which 
the mental health app intervention effectively reduced depressive symptoms 
compared to controls (Hedges g=-0.27, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.17; P<.001). The 
gamification moderator was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms 
(β=-0.03, SE=0.03; P=.38), demonstrating no significant difference in 
effectiveness between mental health apps with and without gamification features. 
A separate meta-regression also did not show an effect of gamification elements 
on intervention adherence (β=-1.93, SE=2.28; P=.40).
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that both mental health apps with and without 
gamification elements were effective in reducing depressive symptoms. There was 
no significant difference in the effectiveness of mental health apps with 
gamification elements on depressive symptoms or adherence. This research has 
important clinical implications for understanding how gamification elements

BACKGROUND: A total of 1 in 2 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) struggles with major depressive or anxiety disorders. The 
co-occurrence of these disorders adds to the complexity of finding utility in as 
well as adherence to a treatment option. Digital therapeutic solutions may 
present a promising alternative treatment option that could mitigate these 
challenges and alleviate symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate (1) the feasibility and acceptance of 
a digital mental health intervention, (2) participants' engagement and retention 
levels, and (3) the potential efficacy with respect to anxiety and depression 
symptoms in a population with ADHD. Our main hypothesis was that a digital, 
data-driven, and personalized intervention for adults with coexisting ADHD and 
depressive or anxiety symptoms would show high engagement and adherence, which 
would be accompanied by a decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms along with 
an increase in quality of life and life satisfaction levels.
METHODS: This real-world data, single-arm study included 30 adult participants 
with ADHD symptomatology and coexisting depressive or anxiety symptoms who 
joined a 16-week digital, data-driven mental health support program. This 
intervention is based on a combination of evidence-based approaches such as 
cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and positive psychology techniques. 
The targeted symptomatology was evaluated using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Barkley Adult ADHD Rating 
Scale-IV. Quality of life aspects were evaluated using the Satisfaction With 
Life Scale and the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire, and user feedback surveys 
were used to assess user experience and acceptability.
RESULTS: The study retention rate was 97% (29/30), and high engagement levels 
were observed, as depicted by the 69 minutes spent on the app per week, 5 
emotion logs per week, and 11.5 mental health actions per week. An average 
decrease of 46.2% (P<.001; r=0.89) in depressive symptoms and 46.4% (P<.001; 
r=0.86) in anxiety symptoms was observed, with clinically significant 
improvement for more than half (17/30, 57% and 18/30, 60%, respectively) of the 
participants. This was followed by an average increase of 23% (P<.001; r=0.78) 
and 20% (P=.003; r=0.8) in Satisfaction With Life Scale and Life Satisfaction 
Questionnaire scores, respectively. The overall participant satisfaction level 
was 4.3 out of 5.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and value of 
the examined digital program for adults with ADHD symptomatology to address the 
coexisting depressive or anxiety symptoms. However, controlled trials with 
larger sample sizes and more diverse participant profiles are required to 
provide further evidence of clinical efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Family members of critically ill patients experience symptoms of 
postintensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F), including anxiety, depression, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder. Postintensive care syndrome-family reduces the 
quality of life of the families of critically ill patients and may impede the 
recovery of such patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy has become a first-line 
nonpharmacological treatment of many psychological symptoms and disorders, 
including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. With regard to managing 
mild-to-moderate symptoms, the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy via 
mobile technology without input from a clinician has been found to be feasible 
and well accepted, and its efficacy rivals that of face-to-face therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our pilot study is to examine the efficacy of using a 
smartphone mobile health (mHealth) app to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy 
and diminish the severity and prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in family members of 
critically ill patients.
METHODS: For our pilot study, 60 family members of critically ill patients will 
be recruited. A repeated-measures longitudinal study design that involves the 
randomization of participants to 2 groups (the control and intervention groups) 
will be used. The intervention group will receive cognitive behavioral therapy, 
which will be delivered via a smartphone mHealth app. Bandura's social cognitive 
theory and an emphasis on mental health self-efficacy form the theoretical 
framework of the study.
RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in August 2020. Data collection and 
analysis are expected to be completed by March 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study represents a novel approach to the treatment of 
PICS-F symptoms and is an extension of previous work conducted by the research 
team. The study will be used to plan a fully powered randomized controlled 
trial.

INTRODUCTION: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (i-CBT) interventions for the 
treatment of depression have been extensively studied and shown to be effective 
in the reduction of depressive symptoms. However, little is known about their 
effects on suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). Information on the impact of 
digital interventions on STB are essential for patients' safety because most 
digital interventions are self-help interventions without direct support options 
in case of a suicidal crisis. Therefore, we aim to conduct a meta-analysis of 
individual participant data (IPDMA) to investigate the effects of i-CBT 
interventions for depression on STB and to explore potential effect moderators.
METHODS: Data will be retrieved from an established and annually updated IPD 
database of randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of 
i-CBT interventions for depression in adults and adolescents. We will conduct a 
one-stage and a two-stage IPDMA on the effects of these interventions on STB. 
All types of control conditions are eligible. STB can be measured using specific 
scales (e.g., Beck scale suicide, BSS) or single items from depression scales 
(e.g., item 9 of the PHQ-9) or standardized clinical interviews. Multilevel 
linear regression will be used for specific scales, and multilevel logistic 
regression will be used for treatment response or deterioration, operationalized 
as a change in score by at least one quartile from baseline. Exploratory 
moderator analyses will be conducted at participant, study, and intervention 
level. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias using the Cochrane 
Risk of Bias Tool 2.
CONCLUSION: This IPDMA will harness the available data to assess the effects 
(response and deterioration) of i-CBT interventions for depression interventions 
on STB. Information about changes in STB is essential to estimate patients' 
safety when engaging in digital treatment formats.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: We will pre-register this study with the open science 
framework after article acceptance to ensure consistency between online 
registration and the published trial protocol.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications have limited benefits in schizophrenia, 
and cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial as an adjunct. There may be 
potential for implementing mobile cognitive behavioral therapy-based treatment 
for schizophrenia in addition to standard antipsychotic medications.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether PEAR-004, a smartphone-based 
investigational digital therapeutic, improves the symptoms of an acute psychotic 
exacerbation of schizophrenia when it is added to standard treatments.
METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, 
rater-blinded, parallel group proof‑of‑concept study of 112 participants with 
moderate acute psychotic exacerbation in schizophrenia. This study was conducted 
in 6 clinical trial research sites in the United States from December 2018 to 
September 2019. The primary outcome, change in Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week 12 or the last available visit, was analyzed 
using the mixed-effects regression model for repeated measures, applied to an 
intent-to-treat sample.
RESULTS: The total PANSS scores slightly decreased from baseline over the study 
period in both groups; the treatment difference at day 85 between PEAR-004 and 
sham was 2.7 points, in favor of the sham (2-sided P=.09). The secondary scales 
found no benefit, except for transient improvement in depressive symptoms with 
PEAR-004. Application engagement was good, and patient and clinical investigator 
satisfaction was high. No safety concerns were observed. There was some evidence 
of study site heterogeneity for the onboarding processes and directions on 
PEAR-004 product use at baseline and throughout the study. However, these 
differences did not affect the efficacy results.
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest-to-date randomized, sham-controlled study of a 
digital therapeutic in schizophrenia, PEAR-004 did not demonstrate an effect on 
the primary outcome-total PANSS scores-when compared with a nonspecific digital 
sham control. The secondary and exploratory results also did not demonstrate any 
notable benefits, except for possible temporary improvement in depressive 
symptoms. This study provided many useful scientific and operational insights 
that can be used in the further clinical development of PEAR-004 and other 
investigational digital therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: In patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), knowledge about the 
associations among changes in depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and self-care 
activities has been requested. This is because such knowledge can be helpful in 
the design of behavioral interventions aimed to improve self-efficacy, reduce 
depressive symptoms, and improve performance of self-care activities in CVD 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate if internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
(iCBT) improves self-efficacy and explore the relationships among changes in 
depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and physical activity, as well as the 
influence of iCBT on these relationships.
METHODS: This study received funding in January 2015. Participant recruitment 
took place between January 2017 and February 2018, and the main findings were 
published in 2019. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a 
randomized controlled study evaluating the effects of a 9-week iCBT program 
compared to an online discussion forum (ODF) on depressive symptoms in patients 
with CVD (N=144). Data were collected at baseline and at the 9-week follow-up. 
Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the differences in self-efficacy 
between the iCBT and ODF groups. Structural equation modeling explored the 
relationships among changes in depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and physical 
activity, as well as the influence of iCBT on these relationships.
RESULTS: At follow-up, a significant difference in the increase in self-efficacy 
favoring iCBT was found (P=.04, Cohen d=0.27). We found an indirect association 
between changes in depressive symptoms and physical activity (β=-.24, P<.01), 
with the change in self-efficacy acting as a mediator. iCBT had a direct effect 
on the changes in depressive symptoms, which in turn influenced the changes in 
self-efficacy (β=.23, P<.001) and physical activity (β=.12, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy was improved by iCBT. However, the influence of iCBT 
on self-efficacy and physical activity was mostly mediated by improvements in 
depressive symptoms.

Insomnia predicts the onset of depression, commonly co-presents with depression 
and often persists following depression remission. However, these conditions can 
be challenging to treat concurrently using depression-specific therapies. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia may be an appropriate treatment to 
improve both insomnia and depressive symptoms. We examined the effects of a 
fully-automated digital cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for insomnia 
(Sleepio) on insomnia and depressive symptoms, and the mediating role of sleep 
improvement on depressive symptoms in participants from two randomized 
controlled trials of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. We also 
explored potential moderators of intervention effects. All participants met 
criteria for probable insomnia disorder and had clinically significant 
depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 ≥ 10; n = 3,352). Individuals allocated to 
treatment in both trials were provided access to digital cognitive behavioural 
therapy. Digital cognitive behavioural therapy significantly improved insomnia 
(p < .001; g = 0.76) and depressive symptoms (p < .001; g = 0.48) at 
post-intervention (weeks 8-10), and increased the odds (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.34, 
3.65) of clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10). 
Improvements in insomnia symptoms at mid-intervention mediated 87% of the 
effects on depressive symptoms at post-intervention. No variables moderated 
effectiveness outcomes, suggesting generalizability of these findings. Our 
results suggest that effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for 
insomnia extend to depressive symptoms in those with clinically significant 
depressive symptomatology. Insomnia may, therefore, be an important therapeutic 
target to assist management of depressive symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression remains a significant concern, posing 
substantial challenges to maternal well-being, infant health, and the 
mother-infant bond, particularly in the face of barriers to traditional support 
and interventions. Previous studies have shown that mobile health (mHealth) 
interventions offer an accessible means to facilitate early detection and 
management of mental health issues while at the same time promoting preventive 
care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Leveraging on 
Virtual Engagement for Maternal Understanding & Mood-enhancement (LoVE4MUM) 
mobile app, which was developed based on the principles of cognitive behavioral 
therapy and psychoeducation and serves as an intervention to prevent postpartum 
depression.
METHODS: This single-blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial includes 64 
mothers recruited from the postnatal ward and randomized using a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either postpartum care (treatment as usual) or postpartum care 
(treatment as usual) plus the self-guided LoVE4MUM mobile app. The primary 
outcome is the effectiveness of the mobile app at improving postpartum 
depression. Secondary outcomes are changes in the mental health literacy score 
and negative automatic thoughts, which are collected using a self-reported 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Patient recruitment began on September 1, 2024. As of January 1, 2025, 
recruitment was successfully completed, with a total of 72 participants 
enrolled: 36 in the intervention group and 36 in the control group . The final 
results are anticipated to be available by March 2025, and publication is 
expected by the end of 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: By examining the LoVE4MUM app alongside standard postpartum care, 
this pilot randomized controlled trial seeks to offer preliminary evidence on 
the potential of mHealth tools to improve maternal mental health as well as to 
reduce postpartum depression symptoms. The findings are expected to contribute 
to the future development of effective, accessible, and scalable interventions 
for mothers.

BACKGROUND: Despite young First Nations Australians being typically healthy, 
happy, and connected to family and culture, high rates of emotional distress, 
suicide, and self-harm are also observed. Differing worldviews of service 
providers and First Nations young people regarding illness and treatment 
practices, language differences, culturally inappropriate service models, 
geographical remoteness, and stigma can all inhibit access to appropriate mental 
health support. Mental health treatments delivered digitally (digital mental 
health; dMH) offer flexible access to evidence-based, nonstigmatizing, low-cost 
treatment and early intervention on a broad scale. There is a rapidly growing 
use and acceptance of these technologies among young First Nations people.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and use 
of the newly developed Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative for 
Youth (AIMhi-Y) app and determine the feasibility of study procedures in 
preparation for future assessments of effectiveness.
METHODS: This was a nonrandomized pre-post study using mixed methods. First 
Nations young people aged 12-25 years who provided consent (with parental 
consent where appropriate) and possessed the ability to navigate a simple app 
with basic English literacy were included. Researchers conducted one 
face-to-face 20-minute session with participants to introduce and orient them to 
the AIMhi-Y app. The app integrates culturally adapted low-intensity cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, and mindfulness-based activities. 
Participants received supportive text messages weekly throughout the 4-week 
intervention period and completed assessments of psychological distress, 
depression, anxiety, substance misuse, help-seeking, service use, and 
parent-rated strengths and difficulties at baseline and 4 weeks. Qualitative 
interviews and rating scales were completed at 4 weeks to gain feedback on 
subjective experience, look and style, content, overall rating, check-ins, and 
involvement in the study. App use data were collected.
RESULTS: Thirty young people (17 males and 13 females) aged between 12 and 18 
(mean 14.0, SD 1.55) years were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks. Repeated 
measures 2-tailed t tests showed improvements in well-being measures that were 
statistically and clinically significant for psychological distress (Kessler 
Psychological Distress Scale, 10-item) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health 
Questionnaire, 2-item). Participants spent on average 37 minutes in the app. The 
app was rated positively, with mean ratings of 4 out of 5 points (on scales of 
1-5). Participants reported that they found the app easy to use, culturally 
relevant, and useful. The feasibility of the study was demonstrated with a 62% 
recruitment rate, a 90% retention rate, and high study acceptability ratings.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports earlier research suggesting that dMH apps that 
are appropriately designed with and for the target populations are a feasible 
and acceptable means of lowering symptoms for mental health disorders among 
First Nations youth.

The goal of the study was to evaluate the end user experience using the MamaLift 
Plus app for 2 weeks to support the treatment of their postpartum depression 
(PPD). A total of 14 participants completed the study and their experiences are 
reported in this publication. Participants reported that MamaLift Plus is an 
acceptable, highly usable, and practical mobile tool to use weekly for the 
management of their PPD. More research is warranted to evaluate the benefit of 
digital behavior health interventions, especially in patient populations where 
mental health care may be limited or harder to access by patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of mobile phone 
applications (App) based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on postpartum 
depression.
METHOD: A non-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted. 
The study population consisted of women attended to three health care centers in 
Kerman, Iran. Participants were recruited between September and November 2018, 
and randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group (mobile application access) 
or control group (no mobile application access). All participants completed the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the baseline and 2 months after 
baseline. Data were analyzed using inferential statistics including chi-square, 
independent sample t-test, paired t-test and linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 75 women with an average age of 27 years participated in 
this study. Before the intervention, there was no statistically significant 
difference between the EPDS score between the two groups (p > 0.001). However, 
in the intervention group, the average EPDS score after intervention was 8.18 
and in the control group was 15.05, which was statistically significant 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide proof that providing a CBT program using a 
mobile application can lead to clinically important improvements in outcomes for 
mothers who suffer from postpartum depression.

INTRODUCTION: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, including smartphone apps 
and wearables, have improved health care by providing innovative solutions for 
monitoring, education and treatment, particularly in mental health.
METHOD: This review synthesises findings from a series of reviews on mHealth 
interventions in psychiatry. Publications were systematically searched in 
PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane 
Library.
RESULTS: Out of 2147 records, 111 studies from 2014 to 2024 focusing on anxiety 
and depression were included. These studies highlight the effectiveness of 
mHealth interventions in reducing symptoms through cognitive-behavioural 
therapy, mindfulness and psychoeducation, benefitting adolescents, perinatal 
women and marginalised groups. Additionally, mHealth shows promise in managing 
substance use disorders and severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder and psychosis.
CONCLUSION: Despite positive outcomes, challenges such as data privacy, user 
engagement and healthcare integration persist. Further robust trials and 
evidence-based research are needed to validate the efficacy of mHealth 
technologies.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts in many different 
spheres, including mental health. Children and adolescents are especially 
vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they 
have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of 
depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, 
access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric 
population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a 
brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and 
adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed 
study is to test the efficacy of the intervention.
METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial 
involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17 years of age, respectively) 
with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised 
Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-score > 70). A total of 280 participants 
will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 
1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of 
cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on 
stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger 
management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in 
both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. 
Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention 
group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A 
blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and 
irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30 days 
thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to 
participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the 
week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data 
collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study.
DISCUSSION: Internet-delivered interventions play a major role in increasing 
access to mental health care. A brief, manualised, internet-delivered 
intervention might help children and adolescents with anxiety or depressive 
symptomatology, even outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Youth with multi-morbidity (one or more chronic diseases) are at increased risk 
of further morbidity and early mortality as they enter their adult years. Recent 
increases in both asthma and obesity among youth have led to high health care 
utilization, increased health related complications, and expanded risks of 
subsequent cardiovascular disease burden. Common symptoms seen with asthma and 
obesity include fatigue, pain, depression, and anxiety. These symptoms can 
result in decreased physical activity, social isolation, and poor quality of 
life, which also may contribute to increased morbidity and mortality over time. 
Youth ages 10-17 are in a transitionary period where their overall health and 
disease management shifts from one of parental oversight to one where the youth 
gradually experience increased autonomy over their health and care management. 
Managing Asthma and Obesity Related Symptoms (MATADORS), is a mHealth 
technology-enhanced nurse-guided intervention that incorporates a novel mobile 
health application and motivational enhancement principles within a behavioral 
activation framework. Providing high-risk youth with strategies to enhance 
symptom self-management may result in decreased symptom prevalence, improved 
quality of life, and long-term reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality as they move into adulthood. Moreover, developing low-cost, scalable 
tools with end-user input may facilitate promote early intervention and improved 
access to care, and reduce overall disease burden and healthcare costs.

INTRODUCTION: The global disease burden of major depressive disorder urgently 
requires prevention in high-risk individuals, such as recently discovered 
insomnia subtypes. Previous studies targeting insomnia with fully automated 
eHealth interventions to prevent depression are inconclusive: dropout was high 
and likely biased, and depressive symptoms in untreated participants on average 
improved rather than worsened.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to efficiently prevent the 
worsening of depressive symptoms by selecting insomnia subtypes at high risk of 
depression for internet-based circadian rhythm support (CRS), cognitive 
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), or their combination (CBT-I+CRS), with 
online therapist guidance to promote adherence.
METHODS: Participants with an insomnia disorder subtype conveying an increased 
risk of depression (n = 132) were randomized to no treatment (NT), CRS, CBT-I, 
or CBT-I+CRS. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (IDS-SR) 
was self-administered at baseline and at four follow-ups spanning 1 year.
RESULTS: Without treatment, depressive symptoms indeed worsened (d = 0.28, p = 
0.041) in high-risk insomnia, but not in a reference group with low-risk 
insomnia. Therapist-guided CBT-I and CBT-I+CRS reduced IDS-SR ratings across all 
follow-up assessments (respectively, d = -0.80, p = 0.001; d = -0.95, p < 
0.001). Only CBT-I+CRS reduced the 1-year incidence of clinically meaningful 
worsening (p = 0.002). Dropout during therapist-guided interventions was very 
low (8%) compared to previous automated interventions (57-62%).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings tentatively suggest that the efficiency of 
population-wide preventive strategies could benefit from the possibility to 
select insomnia subtypes at high risk of developing depression for 
therapist-guided digital CBT-I+CRS. This treatment may provide effective 
long-term prevention of worsening of depressive symptoms.

Given the shortcomings of a mechanistic assumption of traditional cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), a newer generation of CBT-grounded interventions 
focusing on process-orientated emotional and motivational aspects has emerged. 
These so-called third-wave CBTs emphasize function and context of inner 
experience over form and content, and have become evidence-based practice in the 
past four decades. Among these approaches, acceptance and commitment therapy 
(ACT) has both a large body of research for various (mental) health conditions, 
including major depressive disorder (MDD) in particular. ACT is a 
transdiagnostic approach that intends to increase psychological flexibility (PF) 
of clients as a universal mechanism of behavior change and a value-driven 
orientation in life. By focusing on present-moment awareness, acceptance, 
defusion, establishing a stable sense of self, clarifying personal valued life 
directions, and committing to behaviors consistent to these values, ACT targets 
the core processes of PF. Meta-analyses have indicated the efficacy and 
effectiveness of ACT in reducing depressive symptoms and increasing well-being, 
with mainly moderate effect sizes in clinical trials. ACT for MDD has been shown 
to be effective across different delivery modes (e.g., individual, group, 
digital). ACT can also be applied using self-help formats (e.g., mobile apps) 
and combined with features from compatible approaches like behavioral 
activation. There is also evidence for a high acceptability of ACT and adherence 
rates comparable to classic CBT. Moreover, process research has shown that ACT 
works specifically through the mediator of PF and by addressing its suggested 
core therapeutic processes. Given the essential role of offering a personalized 
therapeutic strategy in treatment outcomes and adherence, it is central to 
provide more effective options that match clients' needs and preferences. This 
chapter illustrates different applications of ACT for adults with MDD and the 
current evidence base to promote informed decisions on using ACT as additional 
or stand-alone therapeutic approach.

INTRODUCTION: The health burden due to depression is ever increasing in the 
world. Prevention is a key to reducing this burden. Guided internet 
cognitive-behavioural therapies (iCBT) appear promising but there is room for 
improvement because we do not yet know which of various iCBT skills are more 
efficacious than others, and for whom. In addition, there has been no platform 
for iCBT that can accommodate ongoing evolution of internet technologies.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Based on our decade-long experiences in developing 
smartphone CBT apps and examining them in randomised controlled trials, we have 
developed the Resilience Training App Version 2. This app now covers five CBT 
skills: cognitive restructuring, behavioural activation, problem-solving, 
assertion training and behaviour therapy for insomnia. The current study is 
designed as a master protocol including four 2×2 factorial trials using this app 
(1) to elucidate specific efficacies of each CBT skill, (2) to identify 
participants' characteristics that enable matching between skills and 
individuals, and (3) to allow future inclusion of new skills. We will recruit 
3520 participants with subthreshold depression and ca 1700 participants without 
subthreshold depression, to examine the short-term efficacies of CBT skills to 
reduce depressive symptoms in the former and to explore the long-term efficacies 
in preventing depression in the total sample. The primary outcome for the 
short-term efficacies is the change in depressive symptoms as measured with the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at week 6, and that for the long-term efficacies 
is the incidence of major depressive episodes as assessed by the computerised 
Composite International Diagnostic Interview by week 50.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine (C1556).

BACKGROUND: Negative emotions are a major comorbidity of atopic dermatitis (AD). 
Evidence that supports the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy 
(dCBT) as an adjuvant therapy for AD remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary efficacy of additional dCBT and 
potential neurotransmitter biomarkers for AD accompanied by negative emotions.
METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AD were recruited and examined for clinical 
severity and negative emotions including insomnia, anxiety, and depression. 
Patients with mild-to-moderate negative emotions were divided into two groups 
that received standard care (N = 9) or mobile app-delivered CBT plus standard 
care (N = 11) for 12 weeks. Plasma levels of 40 neurotransmitters were 
determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry pre- and 
post-treatment.
RESULTS: Skin lesions, itch, and insomnia were significantly improved in both 
treatment groups. Improvements of itch (P = 0.0449) and insomnia (P = 0.0089) 
were more robust in the combination treatment group than those in the standard 
treatment group. Neurotransmitters that involve tryptophan, dopamine, and 
histidine pathways were markedly altered in patients with AD compared with 
healthy controls. Taurine levels were selectively increased following dCBT plus 
standard care (P = 0.0259). Baseline levels of L-tyrosine were negatively 
correlated with the reduction of skin lesions (r = -0.9073, P = 0.0334) and itch 
intensity (r = -0.9322, P = 0.0210) in the combination therapy group.
CONCLUSIONS: dCBT provides an efficacious supplementary approach for AD 
accompanied by negative emotions. Emotion-related neurotransmitters may 
contribute to AD and serve as indicators for treatment effects.

INTRODUCTION: Psychosocial factors predict recovery in patients with spinal 
pain. Several of these factors are modifiable, such as depression and anxiety. 
However, primary care physiotherapists who typically manage these patients 
indicate that they do not feel sufficiently competent and equipped to address 
these factors optimally. We developed an eHealth intervention with a focus on 
pain education and behavioural activation to support physiotherapists in 
managing psychosocial factors in patients with spinal pain. This paper describes 
the protocol for a pragmatic randomised clinical trial, which evaluates the 
effectiveness of this eHealth intervention blended with physiotherapy compared 
with physiotherapy alone.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants with non-specific low back pain and/or neck 
pain for at least 6 weeks who also have psychosocial risk factors associated 
with the development or maintenance of persistent pain will be recruited in a 
pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised clinical trial. The experimental 
intervention consists of physiotherapy blended with six online modules of pain 
education and behavioural activation. The control intervention consists of usual 
care physiotherapy. The primary outcomes are disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index for low back pain and Neck Disability Index for neck pain) and perceived 
effect (Global Perceived Effect). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 
2, 6 and 12 months after baseline. The results will be analysed using linear 
mixed models.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Medical Ethical Committee 
of VU Medical Center Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2017.286). Results will be 
reported in peer-reviewed journals, at national and international conferences, 
and in diverse media to share the findings with patients, clinicians and the 
public.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of alcohol consumption in Poland is estimated to be 
as high as 80% of the adult population. The use of stimulants is the second most 
common reason for seeking addiction treatment. However, treatment outcomes 
remain unsatisfactory, as 40-85% of individuals who complete various treatment 
programs relapse and fall back into addiction within 2 years following program 
completion.
METHODS: The 13-armed randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the 
effectiveness of a mobile app-based self-guided psychological intervention 
delivered via a smartphone app (Nałogometr) in reducing craving and lapse risk 
in problematic alcohol or stimulants use. Participant recruitment and data 
collection will be performed from June 2022 to September 2022. The 4-week mobile 
intervention program will include short-term and long-term intervention modules 
based mainly on mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Intervention 
effectiveness assessment will include Ecological Momentary Assessment. That is, 
we will collect longitudinal data on a set of characteristics of day-to-day 
functioning. The primary outcomes will include a self-reported number of lapses 
and addiction craving level. In contrast, the secondary outcomes will be the 
severity of problematic substance use, anxiety and depression scores, and life 
satisfaction scores.
CONCLUSION: This study will establish how mobile app-based self-guided 
psychological interventions can help reduce craving and lapse risk in alcohol 
and stimulant dependence. If successful, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
may provide an innovative, easily available, and cost-effective mHealth approach 
for craving and lapse risk in substance addictions.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is strongly associated with increased risk for depression. 
Approximately 25% of pregnant women develop depression. Treatment for depression 
during pregnancy has several complexities: the use of psychiatric medications 
during pregnancy might result in developmental problems in the child and must be 
used with caution. Psychosocial interventions are effective, but they require 
specialized professionals. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as 
Brazil do not have enough mental health professionals needed to meet this 
demand. In this context, smartphone-based interventions show immense potential. 
We developed Motherly, a smartphone application (app) designed to treat maternal 
depression. We aim to test the efficacy of Motherly in addition to brief 
cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) to treat maternal depression.
METHODS: We will conduct a 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial 
in which 70 pregnant women aged between 16 and 40 years with depression will be 
randomized to intervention or active control. The intervention group will have 
access to Motherly, a smartphone app based on three concepts: psychoeducation, 
behavior monitoring, and gaming elements. Motherly is composed of a package of 
interventions composed of modules: mental health, sleep, nutrition, physical 
activity, social support, prenatal/postnatal support, and educational content. 
The main focus of Motherly is delivering behavioral activation (BA), a brief and 
structured psychological treatment. The app allows participants to schedule and 
engage in, and monitor activities according to a plan to avoid acting 
exclusively according to their mood. The active control group will have access 
to a simplified version of the app consisting of educational content about 
various aspects of pregnancy, maternal physical and mental health, and infant 
development (BA, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, among other 
functionalities, will not be present in this version). Both groups will receive 
four sessions of brief CBT in 8 weeks. Participants will be evaluated by 
assessors blind to randomization and allocation status. Assessments will occur 
at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), posttreatment (T2, week 8), and 
follow-up (T3, when the child is 2 months old). Maternal mental health (prenatal 
anxiety, psychological well-being, perceived stress, depression, depression 
severity, and sleep quality), quality of life, physical activity levels, and 
infant developmental milestones and social/emotional problems will be measured. 
Our primary outcome is the change in maternal prenatal depression from baseline 
to posttreatment (8 weeks).
DISCUSSION: The potential of digital technology to deliver mental health 
interventions has been increasingly recognized worldwide. There is a growing 
literature on interventions using smartphone applications to promote mental 
health, both with or without the intermediation of a mental health professional. 
Our study adds to the literature by testing whether an app providing an 
intervention package, including CBT, psychoeducation, nutrition, physical 
activity, and social support, can promote maternal and child health and 
well-being. In particular, we aim to treat depression, for which the use of 
digital technologies is still scarce. Smartphone applications designed to treat 
maternal depression are especially relevant because of the potential to 
circumvent barriers that prevent pregnant women from accessing mental health 
care.

BACKGROUND: Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST) is a behavioral 
intervention that systematically attenuates external sensory input to the 
nervous system. Previous studies have demonstrated acute anxiolytic and 
antidepressant effects of single sessions of REST in anxious individuals, 
however the duration and time course of these effects is unknown. In the current 
study, we used experience sampling and multiple sessions of REST to explore the 
time course of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects over a 48-hour time 
period.
METHODS: 75 adults with anxiety and/or depression were randomized to complete 6 
sessions of REST (either pool-REST, pool-REST preferred, or chair-REST). 
Post-REST effects were tracked using experience sampling on a smartphone with a 
ten-item survey administered at 6 time points for each session (i.e., 
immediately before and after REST and then 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours later). Using 
principal component analysis, responses to survey items at baseline were reduced 
to broad symptom clusters of anxiety, depression, and serenity and were utilized 
in linear mixed effects models to determine the magnitude and time course of 
post-REST effects.
RESULTS: REST was associated with significant decreases in anxiety and 
depression, and significant increases in serenity, with effects lasting for 48 
hours. Repeated exposure to REST was associated with lower baseline levels of 
anxiety at later sessions.
CONCLUSION: These initial findings suggest that the anxiolytic and 
antidepressant effects of REST persist for at least two days, and that repeated 
REST sessions may have additive effects on lowering anxiety-related symptoms. 
These findings could help to determine the optimal intervention frequency of 
REST and facilitate future investigations focused on the combination of REST 
with standard treatments for anxiety and depression.

INTRODUCTION: University students are one of the most vulnerable populations for 
anxiety disorders worldwide. In Northern Ireland, anxiety disorders appear to be 
more common among the university student population due to the population 
demographics across the region. Despite the need, these students show less 
inclination to access the widely available on-campus well-being services and 
other external professional services. Digital cognitive-behavioural therapy 
(CBT) aims to bridge this gap between the need for psychological help and access 
to it. However, challenges such as limited reach, low adoption, implementation 
barriers and poor long-term maintenance are mainstay issues resulting in reduced 
uptake of digital CBT. As a result, the potential impact of digital CBT is 
currently restricted. The proposed intervention 'Cerina' is a scalable CBT-based 
mobile app with an interactive user interface that can be implemented in 
university settings if found to be feasible and effective.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a single-blind pilot feasibility randomised 
controlled trial aiming to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of 
Cerina in reducing Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms. Participants are 
90 Ulster University students aged 18 and above with self-reported GAD symptoms. 
They will be allocated to two conditions: treatment (ie, access to Cerina for 6 
weeks) and a wait-list control group (ie, optional on-campus well-being services 
for 6 weeks). Participants in the wait-list will access Cerina 6 weeks after 
their randomisation and participants in both conditions will be assessed at 
baseline, at 3 (mid-assessment) and 6 weeks (postassessment). The primary 
outcome is the feasibility of Cerina (ie, adherence to the intervention, its 
usability and the potential to deliver a full trial in the future). The 
secondary outcomes include generalised anxiety, depression, worry and quality of 
life. Additionally, participants in both conditions will be invited to 
semistructured interviews for process evaluation.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been granted by the 
Ulster University Research Ethics Committee (ID: FCPSY-22-084). The results of 
the study will be disseminated through publications in scientific articles and 
presentations at relevant conferences and/or public events.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety frequently coexist with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain and can negatively impact patients' responses to standard 
orthopedic treatments. Nevertheless, mental health is not routinely addressed in 
the orthopedic care setting. If effective, a digital mental health intervention 
may be a feasible and scalable method of addressing mental health in an 
orthopedic setting.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare 2-month changes in mental and physical health 
between orthopedic patients who received a digital mental health intervention in 
addition to usual orthopedic care, those who received usual orthopedic care only 
(without a specific mental health intervention), and those who received 
in-person care with a psychologist as part of their orthopedic treatment plan.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study involving ancillary 
analysis of a pilot feasibility study, 2-month self-reported health changes were 
compared between a cohort of orthopedic patients who received access to a 
digital mental health intervention (Wysa) and 2 convenience sample comparison 
cohorts (patients who received usual orthopedic care without a specific mental 
health intervention and patients who received in-person care with a psychologist 
as part of their orthopedic treatment plan). All patients were 18 years or older 
and reported elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety at an orthopedic clinic 
visit (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] 
Depression or Anxiety score ≥55). The digital intervention was a multi-component 
mobile app that used chatbot technology and text-based access to human 
counselors to provide cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and 
sleep tools, among other features, with an emphasis on behavioral activation and 
pain acceptance. Outcomes of interest were between-cohort differences in the 
2-month longitudinal changes in PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores (primary 
outcomes) and PROMIS Pain Interference and Physical Function scores (secondary 
outcomes).
RESULTS: Among 153 patients (mean age 55, SD 15 years; 128 [83.7%] female; 51 
patients per cohort), patients who received the digital mental health 
intervention showed clinically meaningful improvements at the 2-month follow-up 
for all PROMIS measures (mean longitudinal improvement 2.8-3.7 points; P≤.02). 
After controlling for age and BMI, the improvements in PROMIS Depression, Pain 
Interference, and Physical Function were meaningfully greater than longitudinal 
changes shown by patients who received usual orthopedic care (mean between-group 
difference 2.6-4.8 points; P≤.04). Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function were 
also meaningfully greater than longitudinal changes shown by patients who 
received in-person psychological counseling (mean between-group difference 2.4 
points; P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received a digital mental health intervention as part 
of orthopedic care reported greater 2-month mean improvements in depression, 
pain interference, and physical function than patients who received usual 
orthopedic care. They also reported a greater mean improvement in physical 
function and comparable improvements in depression, anxiety, and pain 
interference compared with orthopedic patients who received in-person 
psychological counseling.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with severe chronic medical 
conditions and premature mortality. Expanding the reach or access to effective 
evidence-based treatments to help persons with AUD is a public health objective. 
Mobile phone or smartphone technology has the potential to increase the 
dissemination of clinical and behavioral interventions (mobile health 
interventions) that increase the initiation and maintenance of sobriety among 
individuals with AUD. Studies about how this group uses their mobile phone and 
their attitudes toward technology may have meaningful implications for 
participant engagement with these interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study examined the potential relationships among 
demographic characteristics (race, gender, age, marital status, and income), 
substance use characteristics (frequency of alcohol and cannabis use), and 
clinical variables (anxiety and depression symptoms) with indicators of mobile 
phone use behaviors and attitudes toward technology.
METHODS: A sample of 71 adults with AUD (mean age 42.9, SD 10.9 years) engaged 
in an alcohol partial hospitalization program completed 4 subscales from the 
Media Technology Usage and Attitudes assessment: Smartphone Usage measures 
various mobile phone behaviors and activities, Positive Attitudes and Negative 
Attitudes measure attitudes toward technology, and the Technological 
Anxiety/Dependence measure assesses level of anxiety when individuals are 
separated from their phone and dependence on this device. Participants also 
provided demographic information and completed the Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. 
Lastly, participants reported their frequency of alcohol use over the past 3 
months using the Drug Use Frequency Scale.
RESULTS: Results for the demographic factors showed a significant main effect 
for age, Smartphone Usage (P=.003; ηp2=0.14), and Positive Attitudes (P=.01; 
ηp2=0.07). Marital status (P=.03; ηp2=0.13) and income (P=.03; ηp2=0.14) were 
associated only with the Technological Anxiety and Dependence subscale. 
Moreover, a significant trend was found for alcohol use and the Technological 
Anxiety/Dependence subscale (P=.06; R2=0.02). Lastly, CES-D scores (P=.03; 
R2=0.08) and GAD symptoms (P=.004; R2=0.13) were significant predictors only of 
the Technological Anxiety/Dependence subscale.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate differences in mobile phone use patterns and 
attitudes toward technology across demographic, substance use, and clinical 
measures among patients with AUD. These results may help inform the development 
of future mHealth interventions among this population.

BACKGROUND: Patients with unipolar depressive disorder are frequently 
hospitalized, and the period following discharge is a high-risk-period. 
Smartphone-based treatments are receiving increasing attention among 
researchers, clinicians, and patients. We aimed to investigate whether a 
smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system reduces the rate and duration 
of readmissions, more than standard treatment, in patients with unipolar 
depressive disorder following hospitalization.
METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled 
trial. The intervention group received a smartphone-based monitoring and 
treatment system in addition to standard treatment. The system allowed patients 
to self-monitor symptoms and access psycho-educative information and cognitive 
modules. The patients were allocated a study-nurse who, based on the monitoring 
data, guided and supported them. The control group received standard treatment. 
The trial lasted six months, with outcome assessments at 0, 3, and 6 months.
RESULTS: We included 120 patients with unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10). 
Intention-to-treat analyses showed no statistically significant differences in 
time to readmission (Log-Rank p=0.9) or duration of readmissions 
(B=-16.41,95%CI:-47.32;25.5,p=0.3) (Primary outcomes). There were no differences 
in clinically rated depressive symptoms (p=0.6) or functioning (p=0.1) 
(secondary outcomes). The intervention group had higher levels of recovery 
(B=7,29, 95%CI:0.82;13,75,p=0.028) and a tendency towards higher quality of life 
(p=0.07), wellbeing (p=0,09) satisfaction with treatment (p=0.05) and behavioral 
activation (p=0.08) compared with the control group (tertiary outcomes).
LIMITATIONS: Patients and study-nurses were unblinded to allocation.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no effect of the intervention on primary or secondary 
outcomes. In tertiary outcomes, patients in the intervention group reported 
higher levels of recovery compared to the control group.

BACKGROUND: Depression and other mental health disorders are prevalent among 
people living with chronic health conditions. Although digital cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered an effective treatment, African American 
individuals are less likely to engage in and adhere to digital therapies for 
mental health disorders compared with White individuals.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand digital CBT mental health 
treatment perceptions and preferences of African American individuals with 
sickle cell disease (SCD).
METHODS: African American individuals with SCD from various US locations were 
invited to participate in a series of focus groups. Participants were introduced 
to a health coach-supported mental health app and then asked a series of 
questions about the usability and appeal of the program as well as, more 
generally, what would make a digital mental health program effective for them. 
The authors reviewed the focus group transcripts and conducted a qualitative 
analysis of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 25 people participated in 5 focus groups. Overall, 5 primary 
themes emerged regarding how app content and related coaching could be modified 
to enhance digital CBT engagement. These themes included connection with others 
living with SCD, the personalization of app content and coaching, 
characteristics of coaches, journaling and pain tracking, and considerations for 
optimal engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing the user experience by making digital CBT tools relevant 
to patient populations is critical for optimizing program engagement and its 
uptake. Our findings highlight potential strategies to modify and design digital 
CBT tools for users with SCD and may also be applicable to patients with other 
chronic conditions.

BACKGROUND: Many teenagers in the United States experience challenges with 
symptoms of depression, and they lack adequate resources for accessing in-person 
mental health care. Involving teens and clinicians in designing technologies 
that use evidence-based practices that reduce barriers to accessing mental 
health care is crucial. Interventions based on behavioral activation (BA) help 
teens understand the relationship between mood and activity, help them practice 
goal-directed behaviors to improve mood, and may be particularly well-suited to 
delivery via internet-based platforms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the needs and challenges that teens and 
mental health clinicians face in depression management and involve them in the 
design process of a remote intervention that uses asynchronous remote 
communities. Our goal is to understand the benefits and challenges of adapting 
BA to an internet-based platform that supports the asynchronous remote community 
approach as a delivery tool for teen depression management.
METHODS: We enrolled mental health clinicians (n=10) and teens (n=8) in 
separate, private, internet-based groups on Slack (Slack Technologies Inc). They 
participated in 20-minute design activities for 10 weeks and were then invited 
to interviews about their experiences in the study.
RESULTS: Both teen and clinician participants wanted internet-based support for 
BA as a supplement to in-person therapy. Although participants perceived the 
asynchronous format as conducive to supporting accessible care, teens and 
clinicians raised concerns about safety, privacy, and the moderating of the 
internet-based group. Design decisions that address these concerns need to be 
balanced with the potential benefits of learning coping skills, increasing 
access to mental health care, and promoting asynchronous human connection to 
support teens.
CONCLUSIONS: We discuss considerations for balancing tensions in privacy and 
safety while designing and selecting internet-based platforms to support remote 
care and integrating evidence-based support when designing digital technologies 
for the treatment of teens with depression.

Depression among young adults represents a growing health problem in the U.S., 
but access to effective treatment remains a challenge. Mobile health (mHealth) 
approaches promise to deliver accessible and effective depression treatment; 
however, questions remain regarding how mHealth depression treatment efficacy 
may vary geographically based on urban and rural environmental contexts. The 
present study addresses this knowledge gap by leveraging data from a randomized 
clinical trial of an mHealth depression treatment called Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy-text (CBT-txt) as applied to a sample of 103 U.S. young adults (ages 
18-25). Prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of CBT-txt to reduce 
depressive symptoms. In the present study, we conduct an exploratory, post hoc 
analysis employing moderated growth curve modeling to investigate whether 
observed treatment efficacy differed between study participants residing in 
rural versus urban areas. The findings indicate that CBT-txt treatment effects 
in terms of reducing depression symptoms were significantly stronger for young 
adults residing in rural, as compared to urban, regions (β = 13.759, 95% CI = 
0.796, 26.723, p < 0.038). We speculate that this is because of the lack of 
mental healthcare resources in rural, as compared to urban areas, as well as the 
greater level of environmental stressors, such as artificial light and noise, 
found in cities, which may mitigate treatment effects.

BACKGROUND: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and disabling 
condition with considerable personal and economic impact. Cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) is a recommended psychological therapy for GAD; however, there are 
substantial barriers to accessing treatment. Digital CBT, in particular 
smartphone-delivered CBT, has the potential to improve accessibility and 
increase dissemination of CBT. Despite the emerging evidence of smartphone-based 
psychological interventions for reducing anxiety, effect size scores are 
typically smaller than in-person interventions, and there is a lack of research 
assessing the efficacy of smartphone-delivered digital interventions 
specifically for GAD.
METHODS: In the DeLTA trial (DigitaL Therapy for Anxiety), we plan to conduct a 
parallel-group superiority randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of 
a novel smartphone-based digital CBT intervention for GAD compared to a waitlist 
control. We aim to recruit 242 adults (aged 18 years or above) with 
moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. This trial will be conducted entirely online 
and will involve assessments at baseline (week 0; immediately preceding 
randomisation), mid-intervention (week 3), post-intervention (week 6; primary 
end point) and follow-up (week 10). The primary objective is to evaluate the 
efficacy of the intervention on GAD symptom severity compared to a waitlist 
control at post-intervention. Secondary objectives are to examine between-group 
effects on GAD at follow-up, and to examine the following secondary outcomes at 
both post-intervention and follow-up: 1) worry; 2) depressive symptoms; 3) 
wellbeing; 4) quality of life; and 5) sleep difficulty.
DISCUSSION: This trial will report findings on the initial efficacy of a novel 
digital CBT intervention for GAD. Results have the potential to contribute 
towards the evidence base for digital CBT for GAD and increase the dissemination 
of CBT.

BACKGROUND: Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is considered effective 
and safe for depression, albeit modestly, and prone to logistical burdens when 
performed in external facilities. Investigation of portable tES (ptES), and 
potentiation of ptES with remote psychological interventions have shown 
positive, but preliminary, results.
RESEARCH DESIGN: We report the rationale and design of an ongoing multi-arm, 
randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial with digital features, 
using ptES and internet-based behavioral therapy (iBT) for major depressive 
disorder (MDD) (NCT04889976).
METHODS: We will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and usability of 
(1) active ptES + active iBT ('double-active'), (2) active ptES + sham iBT 
('ptES-only'), and (3) sham ptES + sham iBT ('double-sham'), in adults with MDD, 
with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 item version (HDRS-17) score ≥ 17 
at baseline, during 6 weeks. Antidepressants are allowed in stable doses during 
the trial.
RESULTS: We primarily co-hypothesize changes in HDRS-17 will be greater in (1) 
'double-active' compared to 'ptES-only,' (2) 'double-active' compared to 
'double-sham,' and (3) 'ptES-only' compared to 'double-sham.' We aim to enroll 
210 patients (70 per arm).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results should offer new insights regarding the efficacy and 
scalability of combined ptES and iBT for MDD, in digital mental health.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability and 
preliminary effects of a recently developed smartphone application, Sleep Ninja, 
for adolescent sleep difficulties.
SETTING: The study was conducted online with Australian individuals recruited 
through the community.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 50 young people aged 12-16 years with sleep 
difficulties.
DESIGN: A single-arm pre-post design was used to evaluate feasibility, 
acceptability and sleep and mental health variables at baseline and 
postintervention.
INTERVENTION: Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia informed the 
development of the Sleep Ninja. The core strategies covered by the app are 
psychoeducation, stimulus control, sleep hygiene and sleep-related cognitive 
therapy. It includes six training sessions (lessons), a sleep tracking function, 
recommended bedtimes based on sleep guidelines, reminders to start a wind-down 
routine each night, a series of sleep tips and general information about sleep. 
Users progress through each training session and conclude the 6-week programme 
with a black belt in sleep.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was evaluated based on consent rates, adherence 
and attrition, acceptability was assessed using questionnaires and a poststudy 
interview, and sleep, depression and anxiety variables were assessed at baseline 
and postintervention.
RESULTS: Data indicated that the Sleep Ninja is a feasible intervention and is 
acceptable to young people. Findings showed that there were significant 
improvements on sleep variables including insomnia (within-group effect size 
d=-0.90), sleep quality (d=-0.46), depression (d=-0.36) and anxiety (d=-0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: The Sleep Ninja is a promising intervention that could assist 
adolescents who experience sleep difficulties. A follow-up randomised controlled 
trial is now warranted.

BACKGROUND: Fear of spiders, or Arachnophobia, is one of the most common 
specific phobias. The gold standard treatment, in vivo exposure therapy, is 
effective, but comes with significant limitations, including restricted 
availability, high costs, and high refusal rates. Novel technologies, such as 
augmented reality, may help to overcome these limitations and make Exposure 
Therapy more accessible by using mobile devices.
OBJECTIVE: This study will use a Randomized Controlled Trial design to 
investigate whether ZeroPhobia: Arachnophobia, a 6-week Augmented Reality 
Exposure Therapy smartphone self-help application, can effectively reduce spider 
phobia symptoms. Additionally, we will examine user-friendliness of the 
application and the effect of usage intensity and presence on treatment outcome.
METHODS: This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry under 
NL70238.029.19 (Trial NL9221). Ethical approval was received on October 11, 
2019. One-hundred-twelve participants (age 18-64, score ≥ 59) on the Fear of 
Spiders Questionnaire [FSQ] will be recruited from the general Dutch population 
and randomly assigned to a treatment or waitlist control group. The ZeroPhobia 
application can be accessed on users' smartphone. Baseline, post-test (i.e., at 
six weeks), 3- and 12-month follow-up assessments will be done, each including 
the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire as the main outcome measure as well as 
additional measures of anxiety, depression, user-friendliness, and presence as 
secondary measures and covariates.
RESULTS: The study was funded on September 25, 2018. Data collection started in 
September 2021 and the study is expected to run until September 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study will improve our understanding of the efficacy and 
feasibility of providing Exposure Therapy for spider phobia using an Augmented 
Reality self-help application, with the intention of making mental health care 
more accessible.

Cognitive behavioral therapy improves psychosocial outcomes in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), but access is limited. We conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral digital therapeutic, 
reclarit, on psychosocial outcomes in adult RA patients with impaired 
health-related quality of life. Participants were randomized to reclarit plus 
treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus educational and informational material 
(active control). The primary outcome was SF-36 mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) 
component summary scores at 3 months, with additional assessments at 6 months. 
reclarit significantly improved SF-36 MCS scores compared to control (mean 
difference 3.3 [95% CI 0.7, 5.9]; p = 0.014), with high user satisfaction and 
sustained improvements at 6 months. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, and 
social/work functioning also improved significantly, while SF-36 PCS, pain, and 
disability scores did not differ. In conclusion, reclarit offers immediate, 
effective, evidence-based and personalized psychological support for RA 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Sleep is necessary for healthy development and mental wellbeing. 
Despite this, many children do not get the recommended duration of sleep each 
night, and many experience sleep problems. Although treatable, existing 
interventions for sleep disturbance are time-consuming, burdensome for families, 
and focus on providing behavioural strategies to parents rather than upskilling 
children directly. To address this gap, we modified Sleep Ninja®, an 
evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) smartphone app 
for adolescent sleep disturbance, to be appropriate for 10 to 12 year olds. 
Here, we describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the 
effect of Sleep Ninja on insomnia and other outcomes, including depression, 
anxiety, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness, and explore effects on the 
emergence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), compared to an active control 
group.
METHODS: We aim to recruit 214 children aged 10 to 12 years old experiencing 
disturbed sleep. Participants will be screened for inclusion, complete the 
baseline assessment, and then be randomly allocated to receive Sleep Ninja, or 
digital psychoeducation flyers (active control) for 6-weeks. The primary 
outcome, insomnia symptoms, along with depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and 
daytime sleepiness will be assessed at 6-weeks (primary endpoint), 3-months, and 
9-months post-baseline (secondary and tertiary endpoints, respectively). A mixed 
model repeated measures analytic approach will be used to conduct 
intention-to-treat analyses to determine whether reductions in insomnia and 
secondary outcomes are greater for those receiving Sleep Ninja relative to the 
control condition at the primary and secondary endpoints. The difference in 
relative risk for MDD onset will be explored at 9-months and compared between 
conditions.
DISCUSSION: This is the first clinical trial examining the effects of a CBT-I 
smartphone app in children experiencing sleep disturbance. Results will provide 
empirical evidence about the effects of Sleep Ninja on insomnia and other mental 
health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease 
characterized by dry skin, eczematous lesions, and an often severe pruritus. The 
disease may have a negative effect on quality of life and is also associated 
with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Few individuals with AD receive any 
form of behavioral intervention. Behavioral interventions for AD are potentially 
efficacious but need to be constructed so that they are safe, credible, and 
user-friendly. We have previously reported on a feasibility study that 
demonstrated that a self-management version of a digital intervention based on 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for AD can potentially be effective in 
reducing AD symptoms. The aim of this secondary report was to further examine 
treatment feasibility and preliminary effects on dermatological quality of life, 
itching sensations, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress.
OBJECTIVE: This is a secondary report on intervention credibility, usability, 
adverse events, and preliminary effects on secondary measures of a 
self-management digital intervention for atopic dermatitis.
METHODS: In total, 21 adults with AD, recruited nationwide in Sweden, were 
assessed by telephone, and used the digital intervention for 8 weeks. 
Participants were also assessed directly afterward and 3 months after the end of 
the intervention. There was no therapist guidance. Feasibility indicators 
included intervention credibility, usability, and possible adverse effects. 
Other measures included preliminary effects on dermatological quality of life, 
itching sensations, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress.
RESULTS: The intervention was regarded as credible and no serious adverse events 
were reported. System usability was, however, found to be below the 
predetermined cutoff for acceptable usability. Preliminary effects at 3-month 
follow-up were in the moderate to large range for dermatological quality of life 
(Cohen d=0.89, 95% CI 0.18-1.56), itching sensations (Cohen d=0.85, 95% CI 
0.15-1.52), depressive symptoms (Cohen d=0.78, 95% CI 0.1-1.45), and perceived 
stress (Cohen d=0.75, 95% CI 0.01-1.36).
CONCLUSIONS: This 8-week self-management digital CBT-based intervention was, 
together with telephone calls before and after, a feasible intervention for 
participants with AD. Preliminary effects were promising and should be explored 
further in a randomized controlled trial. Intervention usability was, however, 
rated below cutoff scores. Efforts should be made to improve written material to 
increase usability.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients experience various forms of psychological distress. 
Their distress, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety, leads to poor 
quality of life, increased medical spending due to frequent visits, and decrease 
in treatment adherence. It is estimated that 30-50% among them would require 
support from mental health professionals: in reality, much less actually receive 
such support partly due to a shortage of qualified professionals and also due to 
psychological barriers in seeking such help. The purpose of the present study is 
to develop the easily accessible and the most efficient and effective smartphone 
psychotherapy package to alleviate depression and anxiety in cancer patients.
METHODS: Based on the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, the 
SMartphone Intervention to LEssen depression/Anxiety and GAIN resilience project 
(SMILE-AGAIN project) is a parallel-group, multicenter, open, stratified block 
randomized, fully factorial trial with four experimental components: 
psychosocial education (PE), behavioral activation (BA), assertion training 
(AT), and problem-solving therapy (PS). The allocation sequences are maintained 
centrally. All participants receive PE and then are randomized to the 
presence/absence of the remaining three components. The primary outcome of this 
study is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score, which will be 
administered as an electronic patient-reported outcome on the patients' 
smartphones after 8 weeks. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Nagoya City University on July 15, 2020 (ID: 46-20-0005). The 
randomized trial, which commenced in March 2021, is currently enrolling 
participants. The estimated end date for this study is March 2023.
DISCUSSION: The highly efficient experimental design will allow for the 
identification of the most effective components and the most efficient 
combinations among the four components of the smartphone psychotherapy package 
for cancer patients. Given that many cancer patients face significant 
psychological hurdles in seeing mental health professionals, easily accessible 
therapeutic interventions without hospital visits may offer benefits. If an 
effective combination of psychotherapy is determined in this study, it can be 
provided using smartphones to patients who cannot easily access hospitals or 
clinics.

BACKGROUND: Reducing the burden of depression is a global health concern. 
Self-guided mobile health (mHealth) apps are one approach to address this 
problem. However, there is little research on self-guided mHealth apps in a 
global sample or on how they are used in the real world. These gaps in our 
knowledge must be addressed to bring the promise of mHealth apps for reducing 
the global burden of depression closer to reality.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the naturalistic user 
behavior of MoodTools, a publicly available, free-to-use, self-guided mHealth 
app designed to improve symptoms of depression, in a global community sample.
METHODS: Mobile analytics data were collected from all unique downloads of the 
Android version of MoodTools between March 1, 2016, and February 28, 2018. Due 
to the deidentification and data aggregation process, no demographic or personal 
identifying information was tied to individual user data. All information was 
stored in aggregated, anonymized data files on Google Analytics' storage 
database. Google's software development kit was used to securely capture data 
about the number of downloads, location of downloads, number of app sessions, 
frequency and duration of app sessions, time between app sessions, and user 
retention, allowing for examination of which app's tools were viewed and for how 
long, including Information (psychoeducation), Test (self-monitoring using the 
Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), Thought Diary (targeting negative 
cognitions), Activities (behavioral activation), Videos (curated from YouTube), 
and Safety Plan (safety plan development and links to quickly access crisis 
management resources).
RESULTS: MoodTools was used by 158,930 people from 198 countries, including 
countries where English was not the primary language and in low- and 
middle-income countries. After the initial download, 51.14% (n=81,277) of users 
returned to the app after the initial download, and retention rates decreased 
with each subsequent app session. The typical person used the app for 3 sessions 
for a total of 12 minutes over 90 days. The most frequently visited tools were 
Test and Thought Diary (n=393,549, 24.32%). On average, users completed and 
reviewed the results of the PHQ-9 for 49 seconds and 53 seconds, respectively, 
and spent 3 minutes and 5 seconds on Thought Diary.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mHealth apps could be one approach (among the many 
needed) to reduce the burden of depression. Observational data collected in this 
study show a global interest in MoodTools, including in low- and middle-income 
countries and countries where English is not the primary language. Future 
research is needed to determine whether people who use self-guided apps 
experience improvement in depressive symptoms, and if so, what "dosage" provides 
a meaningful benefit.

INTRODUCTION: While self-administered mobile app-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, 
attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The 
purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly 
intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes 
recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, 
writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by 
other participants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified 
Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based 
mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app 
program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 
weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were 
administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation.
RESULTS: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) 
scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical 
measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression 
Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of 
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed 
significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all 
participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that 
scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious 
cognitive therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and 
effectiveness of this new treatment format.

Depression is common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but 
preventive behavioural interventions are lacking. This randomised controlled, 
pilot phase-IIa trial aimed to study a physical exercise intervention (EI) and 
bright light therapy (BLT)-both implemented and monitored in an individual, 
naturalistic setting via a mobile health (m-health) system-for feasibility of 
trial design and interventions, and to estimate their effects on depressive 
symptoms in young people with ADHD. Two hundred seven participants aged 
14-45 years were randomised to 10-week add-on intervention of either BLT 
(10,000 lx; daily 30-min sessions) (n = 70), EI (aerobic and 
muscle-strengthening activities 3 days/ week) (n = 69), or treatment-as-usual 
(TAU) (n = 68), of whom 165 (80%) were retained (BLT: n = 54; EI: n = 52; TAU: 
n = 59). Intervention adherence (i.e. ≥ 80% completed sessions) was very low for 
both BLT (n = 13, 22%) and EI (n = 4, 7%). Usability of the m-health system to 
conduct interventions was limited as indicated by objective and subjective data. 
Safety was high and comparable between groups. Changes in depressive symptoms 
(assessed via observer-blind ratings, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) 
between baseline and end of intervention were small (BLT: -0.124 [95% CI: 
-2.219, 1.971], EI: -2.646 [95% CI: -4.777, -0.515], TAU: -1.428 [95% CI: 
-3.381, 0.526]) with no group differences [F(2,153) = 1.45, p = 0.2384]. These 
findings suggest that the m-health approach did not achieve feasibility of EI 
and BLT in young people with ADHD. Prior to designing efficacy studies, 
strategies how to achieve high intervention adherence should be specifically 
investigated in this patient group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

BACKGROUND: Promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young 
people is a major global priority. Building emotional competence skills via a 
mobile app may be an effective, scalable and acceptable way to do this. A 
particular risk factor for anxiety and depression is elevated worry and 
rumination (repetitive negative thinking, RNT). An app designed to reduce RNT 
may prevent future incidence of depression and anxiety.
METHOD/DESIGN: The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults study 
developed an emotional competence app to be tested via randomised controlled 
trials in a longitudinal prospective cohort. This off-shoot study adapts the app 
to focus on targeting RNT (worry, rumination), known risk factors for poor 
mental health. In this study, 16-24 year olds in the UK, who report elevated 
worry and rumination on standardised questionnaires are randomised to (i) 
receive the RNT-targeting app immediately for 6 weeks (ii) a waiting list 
control who receive the app after 6 weeks. In total, the study will aim to 
recruit 204 participants, with no current diagnosis of major depression, bipolar 
disorder or psychosis, across the UK. Assessments take place at baseline 
(pre-randomisation), 6 and 12 weeks post-randomisation. Primary endpoint and 
outcome for the study is level of rumination assessed on the Rumination Response 
Styles Questionnaire at 6 weeks. Worry, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms 
and well-being are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and 
potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored.
DISCUSSION: This trial aims to better understand the benefits of tackling RNT 
via an mobile phone app intervention in young people. This prevention mechanism 
trial will establish whether targeting worry and rumination directly via an app 
provides a feasible approach to prevent depression and anxiety, with scope to 
become a widescale public health strategy for preventing poor mental health and 
promoting well-being in young people.

MARSSI (Momentary Affect Regulation - Safer Sex Intervention) is a 
counseling-plus-mobile health (mhealth) intervention to reduce sexual and 
reproductive health (SRH) risks for women with depression and high-risk sexual 
behavior. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic limiting in-person care, we sought to 
develop the counseling and mhealth app onboarding for virtual implementation. A 
team with SRH, adolescent medicine, motivational interviewing, cognitive 
behavioral therapy, and technology expertise adapted the counseling through an 
iterative consensus process. We identified essential aspects of the counseling, 
specified the content so the counseling could be delivered in person or 
virtually with fidelity, and considered best practices for telehealth for the 
focus population. Virtual counseling retained key elements from in-person 
counseling while including enhancements with engaging visual and audio-video 
aids. Instructions and programming were developed to support virtual counseling 
delivery and onboarding for the mhealth app component of MARSSI. After testing 
the virtual format in mock sessions, we implemented a small-scale feasibility 
study in an adolescent medicine clinic with women with depressive symptoms and 
high-risk sexual behavior age 18-24 years (N = 9). Participants experienced 
minimal technical difficulties and expressed satisfaction with the virtual 
format, and all were able to complete app onboarding successfully. Expanding 
delivery options for SRH interventions to include virtual can improve access, 
particularly for populations with psychological and environmental barriers to 
care.

BACKGROUND: High rates of adolescent depression demand for more effective, 
accessible treatment options. A virtual randomized controlled trial was used to 
assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 5-week, self-guided, cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile application, Spark, compared to a 
psychoeducational mobile application (Active Control) as an adjunct treatment 
for adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A community sample aged 13-21, with self-reported symptoms of 
depression, was recruited nationwide. Participants were randomly assigned to use 
either Spark or Active Control (NSpark = 35; NActive Control = 25). 
Questionnaires, including the PHQ-8 measuring depression symptoms, completed 
before, during, and immediately following completion of the intervention, 
evaluated depressive symptoms, usability, engagement, and participant safety. 
App engagement data were also analyzed.
RESULTS: 60 eligible adolescents (female = 47) were enrolled in 2 months. 35.6% 
of those expressing interest were consented and all enrolled. Study retention 
was high (85%). Spark users rated the app as usable (System Usability 
Scalemean = 80.67) and engaging (User Engagement Scale-Short Formmean = 3.62). 
Median daily use was 29%, and 23% completed all levels. There was a significant 
negative relationship between behavioral activations completed and change in 
PHQ-8. Efficacy analyses revealed a significant main effect of time, F = 40.60, 
p < .001, associated with decreased PHQ-8 scores over time. There was no 
significant Group × Time interaction (F = 0.13, p = .72) though the numeric 
decrease in PHQ-8 was greater for Spark (4.69 vs. 3.56). No serious adverse 
events or adverse device effects were reported for Spark users. Two serious 
adverse events reported in the Active Control group were addressed per our 
safety protocol.
CONCLUSION: Recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates demonstrated study 
feasibility by being comparable or better than other mental health apps. Spark 
was highly acceptable relative to published norms. The study's novel safety 
protocol efficiently detected and managed adverse events. The lack of 
significant difference in depression symptom reduction between Spark and Active 
Control may be explained by study design and study design factors. Procedures 
established during this feasibility study will be leveraged for subsequent 
powered clinical trials evaluating app efficacy and safety.

INTRODUCTION: Bereaved parents, who have lost a child, have an elevated risk to 
develop mental health problems, yet, few studies have evaluated the effect of 
psychosocial interventions developed for bereaved parents. Cognitive-behavioural 
therapy (CBT), both face to face or digitally delivered, has shown to be an 
effective intervention for prolonged grief symptoms. Self-help mobile apps offer 
various advantages and studies show improved mental health after app 
interventions. No app has yet been evaluated targeting prolonged grief in 
bereaved parents. Therefore, the aim of this planned study is to develop and 
examine the effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile app, called My Grief, in 
reducing symptoms of prolonged grief, as well as other psychological symptoms, 
in bereaved parents. Another aim is to assess users' experiences and adverse 
events of My Grief.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a two-armed randomised waitlist-controlled 
trial. Parents living in Sweden, who lost a child between one and ten years ago, 
with elevated symptoms of prolonged grief, will be recruited to participate in 
the trial. The content of My Grief covers four main domains (Learn; 
Self-monitoring; Exercises; Get support) and builds on principles of CBT and the 
proven-effective PTSD Coach app. Participants in the intervention group will 
fill out online questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-ups, 
and the waitlist-controls at baseline and at 3 months. The primary outcome will 
be prolonged grief symptoms at the 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are 
post-traumatic stress and depression symptoms, quality of life and cognitive 
behavioural variables (ie, avoidance, rumination, negative cognitions).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been received from the Swedish 
Ethical Review Authority (project no. 2021-00770). If the app is shown to be 
effective, the app will be made publicly accessible on app stores, so that it 
can benefit other bereaved parents.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders cause substantial health-related burden worldwide. 
Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health 
and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated 
costs. Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at 
improving mental health and well-being. There is a need to discern the active 
components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately 
improve users' mental health.
OBJECTIVE: This study systematically identified mental health conversational 
agents (CAs) currently available in app stores and assessed the behavior change 
techniques (BCTs) used. We further described their main features, technical 
aspects, and quality in terms of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and 
information using the Mobile Application Rating Scale.
METHODS: The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a 
systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and 
an evaluation following predefined criteria. We conducted a systematic app 
search of Apple's App Store and Google Play using 42matters. Apps with CAs in 
English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions 
aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management 
of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. The BCT taxonomy v1, a 
comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change 
components in CAs.
RESULTS: We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. Most CAs had <1000 user 
ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as 
stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). All CAs addressed >1 mental 
disorder. Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Half 
(9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered 
predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial 
intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). CAs used 48 different 
BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. The most common BCTs 
were 3.3 "Social support (emotional)," 4.1 "Instructions for how to perform a 
behavior," 11.2 "Reduce negative emotions," and 6.1 "Demonstration of the 
behavior." One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not 
include core CBT concepts.
CONCLUSIONS: Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such 
as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. The 
most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental 
disorders with few therapeutic elements. CA developers should consider the 
quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management 
when designing mental health CAs. Future research should assess the role of 
artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine 
the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, 
consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital 
mental health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is an 
effective treatment in alleviating insomnia. This study examined the effect of 
dCBT-I for improving sleep quality in patients with insomnia complaints from a 
clinical population in a real-world setting.
METHODS: The study included 6,002 patients aged 18 years and above with primary 
complaints of dissatisfying sleep from a sleep clinic in a psychiatric hospital 
from November 2016 to April 2021. Patients were diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety 
disorders, or anxiety comorbid with insomnia or depression according to ICD-10. 
A mobile app was developed for self-reported assessment and delivering dCBT-I 
interventions and treatment prescriptions to participants. The primary outcome 
was change in global sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI). At 8- and 12-week follow-up, 509 patients were reassessed. Data 
were analyzed with non-parametric tests for repeated measures.
RESULTS: Patients treated with dCBT-I monotherapy were younger, with a more 
frequent family history of insomnia compared to those with medication 
monotherapy and those with combined dCBT-I and medication therapy. Improvements 
of sleep quality from baseline to 8-week follow-up were significant in each 
treatment type. Compared to 8-week follow-up, PSQI scores at 12-week were 
significantly decreased in the depression group receiving combined therapy and 
in the anxiety group treated with dCBT-I monotherapy and with combined therapy. 
A time-by-treatment interaction was detected in anxiety patients indicating 
differential reduction in PSQI scores over time between different treatment 
options.
CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest dCBT-I is a practical and effective 
approach for lessening insomnia symptoms, especially for patients with anxiety 
symptoms suggesting with a more extended intervention period (i.e., 12 weeks).

BACKGROUND: The question 'what works for whom' is essential to mental health 
research, as matching individuals to the treatment best suited to their needs 
has the potential to maximize the effectiveness of existing approaches. 
Digitally administered single-session interventions (SSIs) are effective means 
of reducing depressive symptoms in adolescence, with potential for rapid, 
large-scale implementation. However, little is known about which SSIs work best 
for different adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: We created and tested a treatment selection algorithm for use with 
two SSIs targeting depression in high-symptom adolescents from across the United 
States.
METHODS: Using data from a large-scale RCT comparing two evidence-based SSIs 
(N = 996; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04634903), we utilized a Personalized Advantage 
Index approach to create and evaluate a treatment-matching algorithm for these 
interventions. The two interventions were Project Personality (PP; N = 482), an 
intervention teaching that traits and symptoms are malleable (a 'growth 
mindset'), and the Action Brings Change Project (ABC; N = 514), a behavioral 
activation intervention.
RESULTS: Results indicated no significant difference in 3-month depression 
outcomes between participants assigned to their matched intervention and those 
assigned to their nonmatched intervention. The relationship between predicted 
response to intervention (RTI) and observed RTI was weak for both interventions 
(r = .39 for PP, r = .24 for ABC). Moreover, the correlation between a 
participants' predicted RTI for PP and their predicted RTI for ABC was very high 
(r = .79).
CONCLUSIONS: The utility of treatment selection approaches for SSIs targeting 
adolescent depression appears limited. Results suggest that both (a) predicting 
RTI for SSIs is relatively challenging, and (b) the factors that predict RTI for 
SSIs are similar regardless of the content of the intervention. Given their 
overall effectiveness and their low-intensity, low-cost nature, increasing 
youths' access to both digital SSIs may carry more public health utility than 
additional treatment-matching efforts.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of substance and behavioral addiction is estimated 
between 10 and 15% of the global population and remains a severe public health 
concern. Moreover, addiction treatment has several barriers, such as a lack of 
access to professional treatment or stigmatization. Mobile health interventions 
emerge as a promising solution.
METHODS: This two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the 
efficacy of a mobile app-based self-guided psychological intervention delivered 
via a smartphone app (Nałogometr) in reducing craving and lapse risk in 
problematic behaviors and substance use compared to a control condition. 
Participant recruitment and data collection will start in June 2022 and end in 
September 2022. Due to the nature of the study, i.e., a nationwide study of 
problematic substance use and behaviors, we will aim to recruit all individuals 
willing to participate. The four-week intervention condition includes short-term 
and long-term modules based mainly on mindfulness and cognitive behavioral 
therapy. Longitudinal data on several variables related to craving and lapse 
risk are collected daily using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The 
primary outcomes of interest will be the self-reported number of lapses and 
craving level in daily EMA. Moreover, a questionnaire battery assessment is 
administered at baseline in the first week following onboarding, after five 
weeks, and after six months. The secondary outcome measures will include the 
severity of problematic substance use or behaviors, anxiety and depression, and 
life satisfaction.
RESULTS: Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a leading preventable cause of chronic 
disease and premature death globally, yet over half of the adult Australian 
population is inactive. To address this, web-based physical activity 
interventions, which have the potential to reach large numbers of users at low 
costs, have received considerable attention. To fully realise the potential of 
such interventions, there is a need to further increase their appeal to boost 
engagement and retention, and sustain intervention effects over longer periods 
of time. This randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a 
gamified physical activity intervention that connects users to each other via 
Facebook and is delivered via a mobile app.
METHODS: The study is a three-group, cluster-RCT. Four hundred and forty (440) 
inactive Australian adults who use Facebook at least weekly will be recruited in 
clusters of three to eight existing Facebook friends. Participant clusters will 
be randomly allocated to one of three conditions: (1) waitlist control 
condition, (2) basic experimental condition (pedometer plus basic app with no 
social and gamification features), or (3) socially-enhanced experimental 
condition (pedometer plus app with social and gamification features). 
Participants will undertake assessments at baseline, three and nine months. The 
primary outcome is change in total daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity at three months measured objectively using GENEActive 
accelerometers [Activeinsights Ltd., UK]. Secondary outcomes include 
self-reported physical activity, depression and anxiety, wellbeing, quality of 
life, social-cognitive theory constructs and app usage and engagement.
DISCUSSION: The current study will incorporate novel social and gamification 
elements in order to examine whether the inclusion of these components increases 
the efficacy of app-based physical activity interventions. The findings will be 
used to guide the development and increase the effectiveness of future health 
behaviour interventions.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of digital cognitive behavior therapy 
for insomnia (dCBT-I) delivered during pregnancy on subjective sleep outcomes, 
depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms through 6 months postpartum.
METHODS: People up to 28 weeks gestation (N = 208) with insomnia were randomized 
to 6 weekly sessions of dCBT-I or standard care. We report follow-up data at 3 
and 6 months postpartum. The primary outcome was insomnia symptom severity. 
Secondary sleep outcomes included global sleep quality and insomnia caseness. 
Mental health outcomes included depressive and anxiety symptom severity. We 
evaluated between-condition differences in change from baseline for each 
postpartum timepoint and categorical outcomes.
RESULTS: dCBT-I participants did not experience significantly greater 
improvements in insomnia symptom severity relative to standard care 
participants, but they did experience higher rates of insomnia remission and 
lower rates of insomnia caseness at 6 months postpartum. dCBT-I participants 
experienced greater improvements in depressive symptom severity from baseline to 
both postpartum timepoints, and in anxiety symptom severity from baseline to 3 
months postpartum. The proportion of participants with probable major depression 
at 3 months postpartum was significantly higher among standard care (18%) than 
dCBT-I (4%, p = 0.006) participants; this between-condition difference was 
pronounced among the subset (n = 143) with minimal depressive symptoms at 
baseline (18% vs 0%).
CONCLUSION: dCBT-I use during pregnancy leads to enduring benefits for 
postpartum insomnia remission. Findings provide strong preliminary evidence that 
dCBT-I use during pregnancy may prevent postpartum depression and anxiety, which 
is notable when considering the high frequency and importance of these 
problems.Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov,

elevated anxiety symptoms at two cancer centers were randomized to receive 
either the CBT mobile app for anxiety or a mobile health education program 
(control) delivered via tablet computers, which patients self-administered over 
12 weeks. To assess anxiety, depression symptoms, and quality of life (QOL), we 
used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A, primary outcome), Clinical Global 
Impression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General at baseline 
and 12 weeks. Analysis of covariance models were calculated to assess 
intervention effects on patient outcomes.
RESULTS: Patients (73.8% female; 91.0% white; mean age = 56.45 years, SD = 
11.30) in both study groups reported improvements in anxiety, depression 
symptoms, and QOL from baseline to postassessment, with no significant 
differences in any outcome measure between groups. Secondary analyses showed 
that, among the subgroup of patients with severe baseline anxiety, those 
randomized to the CBT app had greater improvements on the HAM-A (Mean Difference 
= 7.44, standard error [SE] = 3.35, p = .037) and HADS-Anxiety Subscale (Mean 
Difference = 4.44, SE = 1.60, p = .010) compared with the control group.
CONCLUSION: Both the tailored CBT app for anxiety and the health education 
program were associated with improvements in anxiety, mood, and QOL, but these 
outcomes did not differ between study groups. The CBT app was more beneficial 
than health education for patients with severe baseline anxiety.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A cognitive-behavioral therapy mobile application 
tailored to treat anxiety in patients with advanced cancer helps improve access 
to evidence-based supportive care in a convenient, private, and timely manner.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) can 
reduce acute insomnia and depressive symptoms and prevent symptom recurrence. 
The current study evaluated self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms as a 
potential mediator of the relationship between prior dCBT-I and subsequent 
insomnia and depressive symptoms assessed during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic.
METHOD: Participants were 208 adults who completed a randomized controlled trial 
of dCBT-I versus sleep education in 2016-2017 and also completed self-report 
assessments of insomnia, depression, and self-efficacy in managing insomnia 
symptoms. Data were collected in May 2020, five weeks into state-wide COVID-19 
stay-at-home orders. Regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the 
extent to which self-efficacy accounted for the relationship between treatment 
condition and improvement in insomnia and depressive symptoms from pre-treatment 
to COVID-19 follow-up.
RESULTS: Prior dCBT-I predicted greater self-efficacy in managing insomnia 
symptoms. Self-efficacy accounted for 49% and 67% of the protective effect of 
dCBT-I against COVID-era insomnia and depressive symptoms, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study affirms the importance of self-efficacy as a key 
intervention outcome and potential mechanism by which dCBT-I predicts future 
sleep and mental health. Future studies that evaluate the role of self-efficacy 
in treatment effectiveness and resilience can provide additional clues about how 
to optimize dCBT-I for maximum benefit to public health.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a key contributor to the global 
burden of mental illness given its relatively high lifetime prevalence, frequent 
comorbidity, and disability rates. Evidence-based treatment options for 
depression include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT). Beyond traditional CBT, over 15 years ago, Hayes 
proclaimed a new generation of contextualistic and process-orientated so-called 
third wave of CBT interventions, including acceptance and commitment therapy 
(ACT). Using mindfulness and acceptance as well as commitment and behavior 
change processes, the transdiagnostic ACT approach aims to increase 
psychological flexibility as universal mechanism of behavior change and to build 
a value-driven orientation in life. ACT for MDD can be provided as either 
stand-alone individual, group, or self-help formats (e.g., apps) or combined 
with other approaches like behavioral activation. To date, a steadily growing 
empirical support from outcome and process research suggests the efficacy of 
ACT, which appears to work specifically through the six proposed core processes 
involved in psychological flexibility, such as defusion. In view of an ongoing 
interest of clinicians in "third-wave" CBTs and the important role of clients' 
preferences in providing therapy choices that work, the purpose of this chapter 
is to give a brief overview on the application of ACT in the treatment of MDD in 
adults.

BACKGROUND: Symptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with chronic 
musculoskeletal pain, and when this occurs, standard orthopedic treatment is 
less effective. However, mental health intervention is not yet a routine part of 
standard orthopedic treatment, in part because of access-related barriers. 
Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could 
be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care.
OBJECTIVE: This study's primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of 
introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in an outpatient 
orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or 
anxiety. The secondary purpose was to perform a preliminary effectiveness 
analysis of the intervention.
METHODS: In this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included 
adult patients (18 years and older) who presented to a nonsurgical orthopedic 
specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a 
musculoskeletal condition and who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or 
anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] 
Depression and/or Anxiety score ≥55). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a 
research coordinator immediately after the participant's encounter with an 
orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile 
app called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health 
intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based access to human 
counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and 
sleep tools, among other features. For this study, Wysa access also included 
novel, behavioral activation-based features specifically developed for users 
with chronic pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment 
rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined as engagement with 
a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary 
effectiveness outcomes were between-group differences in mean longitudinal 
PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between 
high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split.
RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% 
(51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61). Compared to low users, high users 
reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference 
-4.2 points, 95% CI -8.1 to -0.2; P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group 
differences in PROMIS Depression (-3.2 points, 95% CI -7.5 to 1.2; P=.15) and 
Pain Interference scores (-2.3 points, 95% CI -6.3 to 1.7; P=.26) favored high 
users but did not meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical 
Function scores were comparable between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context 
of orthopedic care is feasible and has the potential to improve mental health 
and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participants' 
engagement rates exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to 
improve recruitment and retention were identified. Further pilot study followed 
by a definitive, randomized controlled trial is warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Technological advances have sparked the development of computer- and 
smartphone-based self-help programs for depressed people, but these programs' 
efficacy is uncertain. This randomized controlled trial evaluated an 
intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or 
the SB Web site.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online, we recruited 283 adult iPhone(®) (Apple, 
Cupertino, CA) users with significant depression symptoms according to the 
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). They were 
randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a version of SB using 
cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target 
depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and 
acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB 
groups were instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All 
participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online 
every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using 
hierarchical linear modeling.
RESULTS: As hypothesized, SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D 
scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohen's d=0.67) and by follow-up 
(d=1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General 
SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences 
between SB versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: These large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light 
of high attrition rates and the motivated, self-selected sample. Nonetheless, 
smartphone-based/Internet-based self-help may play an important role in treating 
depression.

BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports physical activity (PA) as an adjunctive 
treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Few studies, however, have 
examined the relationship between objectively measured PA and MDD treatment 
outcomes using prospective data.
OBJECTIVE: This study is a secondary analysis of data from a 24-week 
internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for MDD. 
The purpose of this analysis was twofold: (1) to examine average daily step 
counts in relation to MDD symptom improvement, and whether pain moderated this 
relationship; and (2) to examine whether changes in step activity (ie, step 
trajectories) during treatment were associated with baseline symptoms and 
symptom improvement.
METHODS: Patients from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health were part of a 
randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of internet-based, 
mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy for young adults (aged 18-30 
years old) with MDD. Data from 20 participants who had completed the 
intervention were analyzed. PA, in the form of objectively measured steps, was 
measured using the Fitbit-HR Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc), and self-reported depression 
severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Linear 
regression analysis was used to test PA's relationship with depression 
improvement and the moderating effect of pain severity and pain interference. 
Growth curve and multivariable regression models were used to test longitudinal 
associations.
RESULTS: Participants walked an average of 8269 steps per day, and each 
additional +1000-step difference between participants was significantly 
associated with a 2.66-point greater improvement (reduction) in BDI-II, 
controlling for anxiety, pain interference, and adherence to Fitbit monitoring 
(P=.02). Pain severity appeared to moderate (reduce) the positive effect of 
average daily steps on BDI-II improvement (P=.03). Higher baseline depression 
and anxiety symptoms predicted less positive step trajectories throughout 
treatment (Ps≤.001), and more positive step trajectories early in the trial 
predicted greater MDD improvement at the end of the trial (Ps<.04). However, 
step trajectories across the full duration of the trial did not significantly 
predict MDD improvement (Ps=.40).
CONCLUSIONS: This study used objective measurements to demonstrate positive 
associations between PA and depression improvement in the context of cognitive 
behavioral treatment. Pain appeared to moderate this relationship, and baseline 
symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted PA trajectories. The findings 
inform future interventions for major depression. Future research with larger 
samples should consider additional moderators of PA-related treatment success 
and the extent to which outcomes are related to PA change in multimodal 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: The pattern of substance use in Iran is characterized by a high 
prevalence of opioid use and opioid use disorder (OUD). Although opioid 
maintenance therapy (OMT) has been introduced in Iran, approximately 50% of 
people with opioid use disorder remain unreached. Moreover, psychosocial 
treatment of OUD and common mental health symptoms during OMT is limited. 
Digital interventions have been shown to improve psychological distress, 
depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. In addition, 
providing psychoeducation and risk reduction counseling to prevent communicable 
diseases like HIV and infectious hepatitis is common via the Internet. However, 
despite these promising advances, no smartphone intervention in OMT has been 
investigated for the treatment of OUD and common comorbid mental health 
symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: We examine the effectiveness of adding a blended smartphone 
intervention based on community reinforcement approach, motivational 
interviewing- and cognitive behavioral therapy compared to OMT as usual that 
aims to improve OMT outcomes and addresses common mental health symptoms in OMT 
patients in Iran.
METHOD: Adults with opioid dependence entering 8 treatment centers in Tehran, 
Iran will be randomly assigned to receive either OMT plus a smartphone 
intervention or OMT as usual. The primary outcomes will be the percentage of 
negative urine tests for illicit, non-prescribed use of opioids (opium, heroin, 
tramadol) and treatment retention. Secondary outcomes will include the longest 
period of abstinence from the illicit, non-prescribed use of opioids (opium, 
heroin, and tramadol) confirmed by urine samples, changes in communicable 
disease risk-taking behaviors, changes in stress and common mental health 
symptoms, and client satisfaction. Data analysis will follow the 
intention-to-treat principle and employ (generalized) linear mixed models.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide substantial knowledge for designing 
effective blended interventions for OUD. Moreover, it will investigate if 
treatment retention and OMT-related outcomes and common mental health symptoms 
can be improved by adding a smartphone intervention to OMT.

Background: Depression is prevalent among individuals who smoke cigarettes and 
increases risk for relapse. A previous clinical trial suggests that Goal2Quit, a 
behavioral activation-based smoking cessation mobile app, effectively increases 
smoking abstinence and reduces depressive symptoms. Objective: Secondary 
analyses were conducted on these trial data to identify predictors of success in 
depression-specific digitalized cessation interventions. Methods: Adult who 
smoked cigarettes (age = 38.4 ± 10.3, 53% women) were randomized to either use 
Goal2Quit for 12 weeks (N = 103), paired with a 2-week sample of nicotine 
replacement therapy (patch and lozenge) or to a Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) control 
(N = 47). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was utilized to 
identify a subset of baseline variables predicting either smoking or depression 
intervention outcomes. The retained predictors were then fitted via linear 
regression models to determine relations to each intervention outcome. Results: 
Relative to TAU, only individuals who spent significant time using Goal2Quit 
(56 ± 46 min) were more likely to reduce cigarette use by at least 50% after 12 
weeks, whereas those who spent minimal time using Goal2Quit (10 ± 2 min) did not 
exhibit significant changes. An interaction between educational attainment and 
treatment group revealed that, as compared to TAU, only app users with an 
educational degree beyond high school exhibited significant reductions in 
depression. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of tailoring 
depression-specific digital cessation interventions to individuals' unique 
engagement needs and educational level. This study provides a potential 
methodological template for future research aimed at personalizing 
technology-based treatments for cigarette users with depressive symptoms.

Behavioral activation-based guided self-help treatment administered through a 
smartphone application: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: The need for cost-effective interventions for people suffering from 
major depressive disorders is essential. Behavioral activation is an 
intervention that can largely benefit from the use of new mobile technologies 
(for example smartphones). Therefore, developing smartphone-based behavioral 
activation interventions might be a way to develop cost-effective treatments for 
people suffering from major depressive disorders. The aim of this study will be 
to test the effects of a smartphone-delivered behavioral activation treatment.
METHODS: The study will be a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 
120 participants, with 60 patients in each group. The treatment group includes 
an 8-week smartphone-based behavioral activation intervention, with minimal 
therapist contact. The smartphone-based intervention consists of a web-based 
psychoeducation, and a smartphone application. There is also a back-end system 
where the therapist can see reports from the patients or activities being 
reported. In the attention control group, we will include brief online education 
and then recommend use of a smartphone application that is not directly aimed at 
depression (for example, 'Effective meditation'). The duration of the control 
condition will also be 8 weeks. For ethical reasons we will give the 
participants in the control group access to the behavioral activation treatment 
following the 8-week treatment period.
DISCUSSIONS: We believe that this trial has at least three important 
implications. First, we believe that smartphones can be integrated even further 
into society and therefore may serve an important role in health care. Second, 
while behavioral activation is a psychological treatment approach for which 
there is empirical support, the use of a smartphone application could serve as 
the therapist's prolonged arm into the daily life of the patient. Third, as we 
have been doing trials on guided Internet treatment for more than 10 years it is 
now time to move to the next generation of information technology - smartphones 
- which are not only relevant for Swedish conditions but also for developing 
countries in the world which are increasingly empowered by mobile phones with 
Internet connection.

Assessment and Disruption of Ruminative Episodes to Enhance Mobile Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions in Clinical Depression: 
Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Journalism, Los Angeles, CA, United States.

BACKGROUND: A just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) is "designed to address 
the dynamically changing needs of individuals via the provision of the type or 
amount of support needed, at the right time when needed." If and how 
rumination-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (RFCBT), the gold standard, 
blocks emotional cascades underlying rumination is unclear. Furthermore, 
cognitive behavioral therapy has been successfully used as a mobile variant, but 
RFCBT has not been adapted for a mobile variant (mobile RFCBT [MRFCBT]) or for a 
JITAI variant.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to pilot-test a fully automated JITAI leveraging 
RFCBT and ways to identify and block cascading depressive rumination.
METHODS: Patients in therapy for clinical depression were recruited for a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT). After consenting to be part of the RCT, they 
were randomly assigned to either of the 2 mobile versions of the RFCBT 
conditions personalized to the individual's rumination timing patterns 
(JITAI-MRFCBT) or a no-treatment control condition through a double-blind 
procedure. Although the initial design was to have a 3-armed trial with 2 JITAI 
conditions (a JITAI and a narrative JITAI condition), we later opted to collapse 
those 2 conditions into 1 JITAI condition because of the low number of 
participants. All participants were recruited and participated through their 
smartphones, receiving 5 SMS text message reminders on each of the 35 days to 
self-report their rumination-related symptoms (eg, rumination episodes and 
duration). In the JITAI-MRFCBT condition, they also received treatment 
materials. The first 7 days provided a rumination baseline, and the last 7 days 
provided a postintervention rumination value. In total, 42% (25/59) of 
volunteers were eligible and provided their phone numbers, 20% (5/25) of whom 
never replied to the SMS text message reminding them to start the RCT. A total 
of 90% (18/20) of volunteers completed it (ie, finishing, as prespecified, 80% 
of the questionnaires and training tasks) and, therefore, were included in the 
analysis.
RESULTS: Using independent 2-tailed t tests with bootstrapping, results showed 
that participants in the JITAI-MRFCBT condition, compared with those in the 
control condition, reported a greater reduction in counts of rumination episodes 
(mean -25.28, SD 14.50 vs mean 1.44, SD 4.12, P<.001) and greater reduced 
average time (minutes) spent in rumination (mean -21.53, SD 17.6 vs mean 1.47, 
SD 1.5; P=.04). Results also suggest that, compared with those in the control 
group, those in treatment reduced ruminative carryover from one episode to the 
next.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that JITAI-MRFCBT may reduce negative 
rumination by providing RFCBT just in time following rumination, thereby 
blocking the next rumination episode using the same trigger. This study supports 
a subsequent, full-scale JITAI and the importance of leveraging mobile 
smartphone technology with MRFCBT to curb depressive symptoms.

Digital self-guided mobile health [mHealth] applications are cost-effective, 
accessible, and well-suited to improve mental health at scale. This randomized 
controlled trial [RCT] evaluated the efficacy of a recently developed mHealth 
programme based on cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] principles in improving 
worry and anxiety. We also examined psychological mindedness [PM] as a mediator 
by which app engagement is thought to improve outcomes. The Intervention group 
completed a 2-week "Anxiety and Worry" programme with daily CBT-informed 
activities, while the active waitlist-control completed a matched 2-week mHealth 
programme on procrastination. Participants filled out the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], and Psychological 
Mindedness Scale [PMS] at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-week follow-up. App 
engagement was measured at post-intervention only. Contrary to prediction, the 
Intervention group did not perform better than the Active Control group; both 
groups showed significant improvements on anxiety and depressive symptoms from 
baseline to follow-up. From post-intervention to follow-up, only the 
Intervention group showed further improvements for anxiety symptoms. Higher 
engagement with the mHealth app predicted lower anxiety and depressive symptoms 
at follow-up, and this relationship was fully mediated by psychological 
mindedness. This study provides evidence that [a] engaging in a CBT mHealth 
programme can reduce anxiety and worry, and [b] Psychological mindedness is a 
potential pathway by which engaging with a mHealth app improves anxiety and 
depressive symptoms. While overall effect sizes were small, at the population 
level, these can make significant contributions to public mental health.

BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of 
cognitive behavioral therapy and digital mental health applications-has been 
increasingly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. As a 
resource-efficient treatment approach, bCBT appears promising for addressing the 
growing need for mental health care services, for example, as an early 
intervention before the chronification of symptoms. However, further research on 
the efficacy and feasibility of integrated bCBT interventions is needed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bCBT program 
comprising short (25 min), weekly face-to-face therapy sessions combined with a 
smartphone-based digital health app for treating mild to moderate symptoms of 
depression or anxiety.
METHODS: This prospective uncontrolled trial comprised 2 measurement points 
(before and after treatment) and 2 intervention groups. We recruited university 
students with mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. On the basis 
of the primary symptoms, participants were assigned to either a depression 
intervention group (n=67 completers) or an anxiety intervention group (n=33 
completers). Participants in each group received 6 weekly individual 
psychotherapy sessions via videoconference and completed modules tailored to 
their respective symptoms in the smartphone-based digital health app.
RESULTS: The depression group displayed medium to large improvements in the 
symptoms of depression (Cohen d=-0.70 to -0.90; P<.001). The anxiety group 
experienced significant improvements in the symptoms of generalized anxiety 
assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale with a large effect size 
(Cohen d=-0.80; P<.001) but not in symptoms of anxiety assessed with the Beck 
Anxiety Inventory (Cohen d=-0.35; P=.06). In addition, both groups experienced 
significant improvements in their perceived self-efficacy (Cohen d=0.50; P<.001 
in the depression group and Cohen d=0.71; P<.001 in the anxiety group) and 
quality of life related to psychological health (Cohen d=0.87; P<.001 in the 
depression group and Cohen d=0.40; P=.03 in the anxiety group). Work and social 
adjustment of patients improved significantly in the depression group (Cohen 
d=-0.49; P<.001) but not in the anxiety group (Cohen d=-0.06; P=.72). Patients' 
mental health literacy improved in the anxiety group (Cohen d=0.45; P=.02) but 
not in the depression group (Cohen d=0.21; P=.10). Patient satisfaction with the 
bCBT program and ratings of the usability of the digital app were high in both 
treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility and 
efficacy of a novel brief bCBT intervention. The intervention effects were 
generalized across a broad spectrum of patient-reported outcomes. Hence, the 
newly developed bCBT intervention appears promising for treating mild to 
moderate depression and anxiety in young adults.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a major challenge worldwide, with significant 
increasing personal, economic, and societal costs. Although empirically 
supported treatments have been developed, they are not always available for 
patients in routine clinical care. Therefore, we need effective and widely 
accessible strategies to prevent the onset of the very first depressive 
symptoms. Mental health apps could prove a valuable solution for this 
desideratum. Although preliminary research has indicated that such apps can be 
useful in treating depression, no study has attempted to test their utility in 
preventing depressive symptoms. The aim of this exploratory study is to contrast 
the efficacy of a smartphone app in reducing cognitive vulnerability and mild 
depressive symptoms, as risk factors for the onset of depression, against a 
wait-list condition. More specifically, we aim to test an app designed to (1) 
decrease general cognitive vulnerability and (2) promote engagement in 
protective, adaptive activities, while (3) counteracting (through gamification 
and customization) the tendency of premature dropout from intervention.
METHODS/DESIGN: Romanian-speaking adults (18 years and older) with access to a 
computer and the Internet and who own a smartphone are included in the study. 
Two parallel randomized clinical trials are conducted: in the first one, 50 
participants free of depressive symptoms (i.e., who obtain scores ≤4 on the 
Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be included, while in the second one 
50 participants with minimal depressive symptoms (i.e., who obtain PHQ-9 scores 
between 5 and 9) will be included. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting 
with substance abuse problems, psychotic symptoms, and organic brain disorders, 
or serious legal or health issues that would prevent them from using the app, as 
well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. Participants 
randomized to the active intervention will autonomously use the smartphone app 
for 4 weeks, while the others will be given access to the app after 4 weeks from 
randomization. The primary outcomes are (1) cognitive vulnerability factors as 
defined within the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) paradigm (i.e., 
dysfunctional cognitions, irrational beliefs, and negative automatic thoughts) 
(for the first trial), and (2) level of depressive symptomatology (for the 
second trial). The app includes self-help materials and exercises based on CBT 
for depression, presented in a tailored manner and incorporating gamification 
elements aimed at boosting motivation to use the app.
DISCUSSION: This study protocol is the first to capitalize on the ubiquity of 
smartphones to large-scale dissemination of CBT-based strategies aimed at 
preventing depression in non-clinical populations.

Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is underused in 
healthcare settings and is challenging for people with insomnia to access 
because of uneven geographical distribution of behavioral sleep medicine 
providers. Prescription digital therapeutics can overcome these barriers. This 
study evaluates the effectiveness of a specific digital CBT-I therapeutic. 
Materials & methods:Digital Real-world Evidence trial for Adults with insomnia 
treated via Mobile (DREAM) is a 9-week, open-label, decentralized clinical trial 
to collect real-world evidence for a digital therapeutic (Somryst™) delivering 
CBT-I to patients with chronic insomnia. The primary objective is to examine the 
effectiveness of Somryst to reduce self-reported insomnia symptoms and severity 
in a real-world population (n = 350). Conclusion: This pragmatic study seeks to 
assess the potential benefits of treating insomnia with an asynchronous, mobile, 
tailored prescription digital therapeutic. Clinical trial registration: 
NCT04325464 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract Chronic insomnia is linked to a range of 
health problems, including heart disease, chronic pain, high blood pressure and 
depression. A behavioral treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the first choice for helping patients overcome 
insomnia and reduce their risks of insomnia-related problems. Although the 
benefits of CBT-I have been established, it can be difficult for patients to 
access trained CBT-I therapists. One possible solution is to use digital forms 
of CBT-I, which patients can access on mobile devices. Somryst™ is a 
prescription digital therapeutic, which means it is authorized by the US FDA and 
has been proven effective in carefully-controlled clinical trials. Less is 
known, however, about how well the prescription digital therapeutic works in 
real-world settings. The Digital Real-world Evidence trial for Adults with 
insomnia treated via Mobile study (DREAM) will explore this question by 
evaluating a range of symptoms and outcomes in at least 350 patients with 
chronic insomnia who will use Somryst and be followed for 1 year.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure survivors experience depression symptoms 
and new impairments in physical function. Behavioural activation, an 
evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment for depression, combined with 
physical rehabilitation, is a promising intervention. Notably, mHealth 
applications (Apps) are potentially effective methods of delivering home-based 
interventions.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability and 
acceptability of a prototype App to deliver a combined, home-based behavioural 
activation and rehabilitation intervention to acute respiratory failure 
survivors.
METHODS: A prospective user-preference study was conducted with acute 
respiratory failure survivors and self-designated care partners. Survivors were 
adults with at least mild depression symptoms before hospital discharge who 
received mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit for ≥24 h. Survivors 
and care partners reviewed the App during a single in-person home visit and 
completed the System Usability Scale (range: 0-100; score >73 considered "good") 
and a semistructured interview.
RESULTS: Ten patient/care partner dyads completed study. The median 
[interquartile range] patient age was 50 [40-64] years, and 50% were female. The 
median System Usability Scale scores among patients and care partners were 76 
[68-83] and 88 [75-94], respectively. Qualitative feedback supported usability 
and acceptability of the App, with three themes reported: (1) stigma associated 
with depression, (2) App as a motivator for recovery, and (3) App providing 
multidisciplinary support for survivor and care partner.
CONCLUSIONS: A mobile App prototype designed to deliver a combined behavioural 
activation and rehabilitation intervention was usable and acceptable to 
survivors of acute respiratory failure and their care partners. Given the 
reported stigma associated with depression, the self-directed App may be 
particularly valuable for motivation and multidisciplinary support.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance symptoms are common in major depressive disorder 
(MDD) and have been found to hamper the treatment effect of conventional 
face-to-face psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. To 
increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment, blended cognitive 
behavioral therapy (bCBT) consisting of web-based and face-to-face treatment is 
on the rise for patients with MDD. To date, no study has examined whether sleep 
disturbance symptoms have an impact on bCBT treatment outcomes and whether it 
affects bCBT and treatment-as-usual (TAU) equally.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to investigate whether baseline 
sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on treatment outcomes independent of 
treatment modality and whether sleep disturbance symptoms impact bCBT and TAU in 
routine care equally.
METHODS: The study was based on data from the E-COMPARED (European Comparative 
Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment Versus 
Treatment-as-Usual) study, a 2-arm, multisite, parallel randomized controlled, 
noninferiority trial. A total of 943 outpatients with MDD were randomized to 
either bCBT (476/943, 50.5%) or TAU consisting of routine clinical MDD treatment 
(467/943, 49.5%). The primary outcome of this study was the change in depression 
symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the 
change in depression symptom severity at the 3- and 6-month follow-up and MDD 
diagnoses at the 12-month follow-up, assessed using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. 
Mixed effects models were used to examine the association of sleep disturbance 
symptoms with treatment outcome and treatment modality over time.
RESULTS: Of the 943 patients recruited for the study, 558 (59.2%) completed the 
12-month follow-up assessment. In the total sample, baseline sleep disturbance 
symptoms did not significantly affect change in depressive symptom severity at 
the 12-month follow-up (β=.16, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.36). However, baseline sleep 
disturbance symptoms were negatively associated with treatment outcome for bCBT 
(β=.49, 95% CI 0.22-0.76) but not for TAU (β=-.23, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.05) at the 
12-month follow-up, even when adjusting for baseline depression symptom 
severity. The same result was seen for the effect of sleep disturbance symptoms 
on the presence of depression measured with Mini-International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview at the 12-month follow-up. However, for both treatment formats, 
baseline sleep disturbance symptoms were not associated with depression symptom 
severity at either the 3- (β=.06, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.23) or 6-month (β=.09, 95% 
CI -0.10 to 0.28) follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline sleep disturbance symptoms may have a negative impact on 
long-term treatment outcomes in bCBT for MDD. This effect was not observed for 
TAU. These findings suggest that special attention to sleep disturbance symptoms 
might be warranted when MDD is treated with bCBT. Future studies should 
investigate the effect of implementing modules specifically targeting sleep 
disturbance symptoms in bCBT for MDD to improve long-term prognosis.

Insomnia is highly prevalent among military veterans but access to 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited. Thus, this study 
examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of Insomnia 
Coach, a CBT-I-based, free, self-management mobile app. Fifty U.S. veterans, who 
were mostly male (58%) and mean age 44.5 (range = 28-55) years with moderate 
insomnia symptoms were randomized to Insomnia Coach (n = 25) or a wait-list 
control condition (n = 25) for 6 weeks. Participants completed self-report 
measures and sleep diaries at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up (12 weeks 
postrandomization), and app participants (n = 15) completed a qualitative 
interview at posttreatment. Findings suggest that Insomnia Coach is feasible to 
use, with three quarters of participants using the app through 6 weeks and 
engaging with active elements. For acceptability, perceptions of Insomnia Coach 
were very favorable based on both self-report and qualitative interview 
responses. Finally, for potential efficacy, at posttreatment, a larger 
proportion of Insomnia Coach (28%) than wait-list control participants (4%) 
achieved clinically significant improvement (p = .049) and there was a 
significant treatment effect on daytime sleep-related impairment (d = -0.6, p = 
.044). Additional treatment effects emerged at follow-up for insomnia severity 
(d = -1.1, p = .001), sleep onset latency (d = -0.6, p = .021), global sleep 
quality (d = -0.9, p = .002), and depression symptoms (d = -0.8, p = .012). 
These findings provide preliminary evidence that among veterans with moderate 
insomnia symptoms, a CBT-I-based self-management app is feasible, acceptable, 
and promising for improving insomnia severity and other sleep-related outcomes. 
Given the vast unmet need for insomnia treatment in the population, Insomnia 
Coach may provide an easily accessible, convenient public health intervention 
for individuals not receiving care.

BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting about 1 in 100 
people in the United Kingdom. Many individuals experience a lower quality of 
life as a result of their epilepsy diagnosis and are more likely to develop 
mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. Medical interventions 
for this client group tend to focus on the treatment of seizures, whereas mental 
health disorders often remain undiagnosed and untreated. Early identification 
and treatment of mental health difficulties in people with epilepsy are vital to 
ensure better outcomes and improvements in quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this exploratory randomized controlled trial is to 
evaluate whether an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention 
delivered through a mobile app-ThinkNinja for Epilepsy-is a clinically effective 
tool to improve quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being in a 
large sample of people with epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and 
depression.
METHODS: The study aims to recruit 184 individuals, 18 to 65 years of age, with 
a self-reported diagnosis of epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and 
depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to the ThinkNinja for 
Epilepsy app condition (arm A) or the waiting-list control group (arm B). 
Participants in arm A will receive access to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app 
first. After 8 weeks, participants in arm B will receive the same full access to 
the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app as the participants in arm A. This design will 
allow an initial between-subjects analysis between the two conditions as well as 
a within-subject analysis including all participants. The primary outcome is 
participants' quality of life, measured by the 10-item patient-weighted Quality 
of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include measures of 
anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment; depression, 
using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; medication adherence, using the 
Medication Adherence Questionnaire; and impression of change, using the Patient 
Global Impression of Change questionnaire.
RESULTS: Recruitment for this study began in March 2022 and was completed in 
October 2022. We expect data collection to be finalized by May 2023 and study 
results to be available within 12 months of the final data collection date. 
Results of the study will be written up as soon as possible thereafter, with the 
intention of publishing the outcomes in high-quality peer-reviewed journals.
CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of 
the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy intervention at improving the quality of life, 
mental health, and emotional well-being of people with epilepsy. The findings 
from our study will hopefully contribute to addressing the critical gap in 
universal provision and accessibility of mental health and emotional well-being 
support for people with epilepsy.

Due to the limited availability of in-person interventions for caregivers, the 
development of effective programs that use new technologies to prevent 
depression is needed. The goal of this research was to assess the efficacy of a 
cognitive behavioral intervention for the prevention of depression, administered 
to nonprofessional caregivers through a smartphone application (app). One 
hundred and seventy-five caregivers were randomly assigned to either an 
app-based cognitive behavioral intervention (CBIA), the CBIA intervention plus a 
telephone conference call (CBIA + CC), or an attention control group (ACG). At 
post-intervention, the incidence of depression was lower in the CBIA and CBIA + 
CC compared to the ACG (1.7% and 0.0% vs. 7.9%, respectively). The absolute 
risk, relative risk, and number needed to treat compared to the ACG were 6.2%, 
21.6%, and 16 for the CBIA, whilst they were 8%, 0.0%, and 13 for the CBIA + CC. 
Depressive symptomatology was significantly lower in the CBIA and CBIA + CC 
compared to the ACG (d = 0.84, Cliff's δ = 0.49; d = 1.56, Cliff's δ = 0.72), as 
well as in the CBIA + CC compared to the CBIA (d = 0.72, Cliff's δ = 0.44). The 
prevention of depression was more likely in participants who received the CBIA, 
and adding the conference call in the CBIA + CC group improved the likelihood of 
this.

England, Armidale, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Mobile mental health apps have become ubiquitous tools to assist 
people in managing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, due to the lack 
of research and expert input that has accompanied the development of most apps, 
concerns have been raised by clinicians, researchers, and government authorities 
about their efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to estimate the proportion of mental health apps 
offering comprehensive therapeutic treatments for anxiety and/or depression 
available in the app stores that have been developed using evidence-based 
frameworks. It also aimed to estimate the proportions of specific frameworks 
being used in an effort to understand which frameworks are having the most 
influence on app developers in this area.
METHODS: A systematic review of the Apple App Store and Google Play store was 
performed to identify apps offering comprehensive therapeutic interventions that 
targeted anxiety and/or depression. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist was adapted to guide this 
approach.
RESULTS: Of the 293 apps shortlisted as offering a therapeutic treatment for 
anxiety and/or depression, 162 (55.3%) mentioned an evidence-based framework in 
their app store descriptions. Of the 293 apps, 88 (30.0%) claimed to use 
cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, 46 (15.7%) claimed to use mindfulness, 
27 (9.2%) claimed to use positive psychology, 10 (3.4%) claimed to use 
dialectical behavior therapy, 5 (1.7%) claimed to use acceptance and commitment 
therapy, and 20 (6.8%) claimed to use other techniques. Of the 162 apps that 
claimed to use a theoretical framework, only 10 (6.2%) had published evidence 
for their efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The current proportion of apps developed using evidence-based 
frameworks is unacceptably low, and those without tested frameworks may be 
ineffective, or worse, pose a risk of harm to users. Future research should 
establish what other factors work in conjunction with evidence-based frameworks 
to produce efficacious mental health apps.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that results in 
significant morbidity and mortality. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment 
for bipolar disorder; however, adjunctive psychotherapy can help individuals use 
self-management strategies to improve outcomes. Yet access to this therapy is 
limited. Smartphones and other technologies have the potential to increase 
access to therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while 
simultaneously providing real-time user feedback and provider alerts to augment 
care.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the user-centered development of LiveWell, a 
smartphone-based self-management intervention for bipolar disorder, to 
contribute to and support the ongoing improvement and dissemination of 
technology-based mental health interventions.
METHODS: Individuals with bipolar disorder first participated in a field trial 
of a simple smartphone app for self-monitoring of behavioral targets. To develop 
a complete technology-based intervention for bipolar disorder, this field trial 
was followed by design sessions, usability testing, and a pilot study of a 
smartphone-based self-management intervention for bipolar disorder. Throughout 
all phases of development, intervention revisions were made based on user 
feedback.
RESULTS: The core of the LiveWell intervention consists of a daily 
self-monitoring tool, the Daily Check-in. This self-monitoring tool underwent 
multiple revisions during the user-centered development process. Daily Check-in 
mood and thought rating scales were collapsed into a single wellness rating 
scale to accommodate user development of personalized scale anchors. These 
anchors are meant to assist users in identifying early warning signs and 
symptoms of impending episodes to take action based on personalized plans. When 
users identified personal anchors for the wellness scale, the anchors most 
commonly reflected behavioral signs and symptoms (40%), followed by cognitive 
(25%), mood (15%), physical (10%), and motivational (7%) signs and symptoms. 
Changes to the Daily Check-in were also made to help users distinguish between 
getting adequate sleep and keeping a regular routine. At the end of the pilot 
study, users reported that the Daily Check-in made them more aware of early 
warning signs and symptoms and how much they were sleeping. Users also reported 
that they liked personalizing their anchors and plans and felt this process was 
useful. Users experienced some difficulties with developing, tracking, and 
achieving target goals. Users also did not consistently follow up with app 
recommendations to contact providers when Daily Check-in data suggested they 
needed additional assistance. As a result, the human support roles for the 
technology were expanded beyond app use support to include support for 
self-management and clinical care communication. The development of these human 
support roles was aided by feedback on the technology's usability from the users 
and the coaches who provided the human support.
CONCLUSIONS: User input guided the development of intervention content, 
technology, and coaching support for LiveWell. Users valued the provision of 
monitoring tools and the ability to personalize plans for staying well, 
supporting the role of monitoring and personalization as important features of 
digital mental health technologies. Users also valued human support of the 
technology in the form of a coach, and user difficulties with aspects of 
self-management and care-provider communication led to an expansion of the 
coach's support roles. Obtaining feedback from both users and coaches played an 
important role in the development of both the LiveWell technology and human 
support. Attention to all stakeholders involved in the use of mental health 
technologies is essential for optimizing intervention development.

This study analyzed digital health applications (DiHA) available in Germany for 
treating depression, with 41% (26/64) targeting mental health. Cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) is the dominant approach, as six DiHA focus on CBT, 
featuring common components like managing unwanted thoughts, behavioral 
activation, and relaxation. However, only three apps include cognitive 
restructuring, a key aspect of CBT. There is a lack of DiHA for alternative 
therapy methods like depth psychology, limiting options for patients seeking 
different approaches. The analysis also found fragmented information on app 
components, suggesting a need for centralizing comprehensive data in the 
official DiHA directory for better decision-making.

Adolescent depression is common; however, over 60% of depressed adolescents do 
not receive mental health care. Digitally-delivered evidence-based psychosocial 
interventions (EBPIs) may provide an opportunity to improve access and 
engagement in mental health care. We present a case study that reviews lessons 
learned from using the Discover - Design - Build - Test (DDBT) model to create, 
develop, and evaluate a high-fidelity prototype of an app to deliver an EBPI for 
depression, behavioral activation (BA), on an Asynchronous Remote Communities 
(ARC) platform (referred to as ActivaTeen). We review work at each stage of the 
DDBT framework, including initial formative work, iterative design and 
development work, and an initial feasibility study. We engaged teens with 
depression, mental health clinicians, and expert evaluators through the process. 
We found that the DDBT model supported the research team in understanding the 
requirements for our prototype system, ActivaTeen, and conceiving of and 
developing specific ideas for implementation. Our work contributes a case study 
of how the DDBT framework can be applied to adapting an EBPI to a new, scalable 
and digital format. We provide lessons learned from engaging teens and 
clinicians with an asynchronous approach to EBPIs and human centered design 
considerations for teen mental health.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer has a strong impact on the mental state of those 
affected. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one effective approach to reduce 
disease burden. This randomized controlled pilot trial aimed to assess the 
effect of the digital CBT-based application Living Well on psychological 
outcomes in a German female breast cancer population.
METHODS: Female breast cancer patients (n = 70) with ongoing or finished 
oncological treatment that is who were receiving or had received any type of 
oncological treatment were included in the study and randomized to an 
intervention group (IG, n = 32) receiving Living Well in addition to care as 
usual, and a control group (CG, n = 38) receiving care as usual only. 
Participants completed standardized questionnaires at baseline and after 2, 4, 
8, and 12 weeks to assess anxiety and depression (HADS) as primary outcomes, 
distress (DT), health-related quality of life (HRQoL, AQoL-8D), and illness 
perception (B-IPQ) as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks, significant (p < 0.05) higher improvements in the IG 
could be observed in anxiety levels, HRQoL, and illness perception, when 
compared to the CG. Age and time since diagnosis were found to be relevant 
covariates for anxiety levels. In distress levels, the IG showed a clinically 
relevant and nearly significant reduction compared to the CG (p = 0.057). No 
effects could be observed in depression levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the potential of Living Well to improve 
psychological outcomes of female breast cancer patients and encourage further 
studies evaluating the effectiveness of the digital application.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered in the German Clinical Trials 
Register (DRKS00029918).

INTRODUCTION: Relapse following acute treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) is 
common. Evidence suggests cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be useful in 
the post-acute period, but few patients have access to trained providers. 
mHealth technologies have potential to increase access to high-quality care for 
AN, including in the post-acute period. The aim of this study is to estimate the 
preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile intervention 
plus treatment as usual (TAU), offered with and without an accompanying social 
networking feature.
METHOD: In the current pilot randomized controlled trial, women with AN who have 
been discharged from acute treatment in the past 2 months (N = 90) will be 
randomly assigned to a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual 
(TAU), a CBT-based mobile intervention including social networking plus TAU, or 
TAU alone. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
effectiveness of the three conditions in terms of reducing eating disorder 
psychopathology, reducing frequency of eating disorder behaviors, achieving 
weight maintenance, reducing depression and suicidal ideation, and reducing 
clinical impairment. We will examine rehospitalization and full recovery rates 
in an exploratory fashion. We will also examine whether the mobile intervention 
and social networking feature change the proposed targets and whether changes in 
targets are associated with benefit, as well as conduct exploratory analyses to 
identify within-mobile intervention predictors and moderators of outcome.
DISCUSSION: Ultimately, this research may lead to increased access to 
evidence-based treatment for individuals with AN and prevention of the extreme 
negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Relapse after acute treatment for anorexia nervosa is 
common, and few patients have access to trained providers to support them 
following acute care. This study will pilot a coached mobile app, including a 
social networking component, for this population. If ultimately successful, our 
approach could greatly increase access to evidence-based treatment for 
individuals with anorexia nervosa and ultimately prevent the extreme negative 
consequences that can result from this serious disorder.

OBJECTIVE: Since the impact of the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, the need 
for efficiency in medical services has become more urgent than ever. The digital 
treatment market is rapidly growing worldwide and digital therapeutics (DTx), a 
major part of the digital medical services, is also emerging as a new paradigm 
for treatment, with its industry growing rapidly as well. Increasing research is 
done on the effectiveness of mobile DTx in improving mental health conditions 
such as insomnia, panic, and depression.
METHODS: This review paper investigates 1) the functions and characteristics of 
mobile digital mental health care applications for the treatment of anxiety 
symptoms, 2) extracts common attributes of the applications, and 3) compares 
them with existing traditional treatment mechanisms.
RESULTS: Among the 20,000 mental health management applications that have been 
developed so far, 8 applications that are relatively widely used were selected 
and reviewed. Check-in, self-help tips, quick relief, journal, courses for 
practice are common features of the digital mental health care applications for 
anxiety and are also widely used feature in the cognitive behavioral therapy.
CONCLUSION: Based on this review, we have proposed the essential elements and 
directions for the development of a Korean digital mental health care 
applications for anxiety disorders.

Treatment for depression is a core health disparity for Latino/as in the United 
States. U.S. Latino/as are most likely to report depressive symptoms to primary 
care physicians, who often have limited resources for providing evidence-based 
psychological depression treatment. This limited treatment accessibility is 
further compounded by additional treatment barriers, including stigma related to 
seeking mental health treatment and limited English proficiency. Mobile 
technologies, including smartphones and mobile applications (apps) delivered via 
smartphone, are promising for addressing this treatment need. Herein, we discuss 
the development of a Spanish-language brief behavioral activation mobile 
application, ¡Aptívate!, that was developed to disseminate depression-based 
psychological treatment via primary care to Spanish-speaking Latino/as. This

The number of college students who need mental health treatment outpaces the 
resources available to counseling centers to provide these needed services, 
presenting a need for low-cost, scalable interventions for college populations. 
We conducted a pilot implementation-effectiveness trial of a scalable treatment 
package that consisted of a single (telehealth) workshop plus a companion app 
that provided ecological momentary intervention. Participants (n = 177) received 
a workshop provided by counseling center staff and trainees. We were interested 
in (1) engagement with the app, (2) acceptability of the treatment package, and 
(3) initial effectiveness of the treatment package. Regarding engagement with 
the app, we found that participants preferred two reminder prompts per day and 
identified two key breakpoints when engagement declined significantly: at day 
15, when just over half of the sample practiced a skill on the app at least once 
during the day and at day 41, when just over one third of people practiced a 
skill on the app each day. Regarding acceptability of the treatment package, 
students generally reported positive attitudes about the single-session workshop 
and app, but also noted that the content and assessments in the app needed to be 
more dynamic to improve how engaging it is. Regarding effectiveness, we found 
that about 75% of the sample experienced a significant reduction in negative 
affect from pre- to post-ecological momentary intervention. Moreover, there were 
significant pre- to post-study decreases in experiential avoidance and symptoms 
of anxiety and depression and increases in self-efficacy for managing negative 
emotions. The results of this study are promising in terms of providing initial 
support for this novel treatment package and provide useful information for 
researchers planning to develop and test similar interventions.

Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent among cancer patients in the United States 
(US), with up to half of cancer patients smoking at the time of their initial 
cancer diagnosis. However, evidence-based cessation programs are rarely 
implemented in oncology care, and smoking is not consistently treated in cancer 
treatment settings. Consequently, there is an urgent need for accessible and 
efficacious cessation treatments that are uniquely tailored to the needs of 
cancer patients. Here we describe the design and implementation of a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of a smartphone app (Quit2Heal) 
versus a US Clinical Practice Guidelines-based app (QuitGuide) for smoking 
cessation among a planned sample of 422 cancer patients. Quit2Heal is designed 
to address cancer-related shame, stigma, depression, anxiety, and knowledge 
about the consequences of smoking/quitting. Quit2Heal is based on the principles 
of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a behavioral therapy that teaches skills 
for accepting cravings to smoke without smoking, values-driven motivation to 
quit, and preventing relapse. The primary aim of the RCT is to determine whether 
Quit2Heal has significantly higher self-reported 30-day point prevalence 
abstinence at 12 months relative to QuitGuide. The trial will also determine 
whether Quit2Heal's effect on cessation is (1) mediated by improvements in 
cancer-related shame, stigma, depression, anxiety, and knowledge about the 
consequences of smoking/quitting; and (2) moderated by baseline factors (e.g., 
cancer type, stage, time since diagnosis). If successful, Quit2Heal will offer a 
more efficacious, broadly scalable smoking cessation treatment that could be 
implemented alongside existing oncology care, thereby improving cancer outcomes.

Evidence for the impact of psychological Interventions for subthreshold 
depression (sD) is conflicting. Moreover, human resources to deliver such 
treatments are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 
web-based intervention with adherence-focused guidance in the treatment of sD. 
Participants with sD (CES-D≥ 16, no Major Depressive Disorder according to 
DSM-IV criteria, N = 204) recruited via a large health insurance were randomly 
allocated to a web-based mobile-supported cognitive-behavioral intervention or 
to a waitlist control condition with unrestricted access to usual care. The 
primary outcome was the reduction in depressive symptom severity as measured by 
blind diagnostic raters using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 
(QIDS) at posttreatment. There was a statistically significant between-group 
difference in QIDS scores at posttreatment in favor of the intervention group, 
F(1, 201) = 11.31, p = .001, corresponding to a medium effect size of d = 0.37 
(95% CI 0.09-0.64) and a NNT of 7 (95%-CI 3.7-41.2). Significant effects in 
favour of the intervention group were also found for secondary outcomes such as 
quality of life, anxiety, and insomnia severity. Web-based self-help 
interventions with adherence-focused guidance could be an acceptable and 
effective approach to reduce a range of negative consequences associated with 
subclinical depression.

BACKGROUND: Smartphone addiction, which represents a behavioral concern, has 
been found to correlate with a diverse range of mental health problems among the 
undergraduate students. Meanwhile, the modes of behavioral inhibition/activation 
showed specific characteristics in smartphone addiction individuals. Therefore, 
clarifying the interaction of mental health and behavioral modes with smartphone 
addiction is urgent. Here, we used a cross-sectional design, aiming to explore 
the network interactions among smartphone addiction, mental health (depression, 
anxiety, stress, loneliness and life satisfaction), and the behavioral 
inhibition/activation system (BIS/BAS) in undergraduate students.
METHODS: We employed network analysis and community detection in R, to 
investigate the centrality and edge connections, which are the mainly index of 
key factors and interaction effects between factors respectively. The study was 
carried out among 701 participants with an average age of 18.27 ± 1.57 years 
old, all of whom had completed self-report scales.
RESULTS: The network analysis results suggested that depression and anxiety, the 
behavioral activation of fun seeking, reward responsiveness and behavioral 
inhibition had significantly higher centrality than the other mental health and 
BIS/BAS factors respectively. When combining the connections of network analysis 
and community detection, the stronger connections mainly present in the inner 
domain of mental health factors and the BIS/BAS, respectively. The findings 
regarding the transdomain connections imply that stress is likely to serve as a 
mediator in the relationships between smartphone addiction and both depression 
as well as BAS-Drive.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, the current study suggests that although common 
psychological and behavioral system problems may play a dominant role in 
smartphone addiction among undergraduate students, it is still necessary to 
consider whether other factors such as stress may play a potential moderating 
role. The new insight will help to enhance mental health and facilitating proper 
smartphone use management to avoid the aggravation of addiction problems among 
undergraduate student.

BACKGROUND: Rural older adults experience a high burden of depressive symptoms 
and significant barriers to accessing mental health services. The Modified 
Behavioral Activation Treatment (MBAT) has been verified to be effective among 
rural older adults in China. Due to its structured format and skill-based 
learning, it is well suited for digital-based delivery. However, only a few 
studies were from developed countries, and the evidence to support its 
application in rural China still needs to be provided. Thus, based on the fact 
that digital health technology has the potential to address the shortage of 
healthcare resources and the constraints of community mental health services in 
rural China, the effectiveness of the digital MBAT (D-MBAT) program among rural 
older adults is worth further evaluation.
METHODS: A multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 216 
rural older adults from Huayuan County and Fenghuang County in Western Hunan. 
The intervention group will receive the D-MBAT program, while the control group 
will receive routine care. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, social health, 
quality of life, and satisfaction will be measured at baseline, one-month, and 
three-month follow-ups to evaluate the digital MBAT program's effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: Existing digital psychological intervention strategies seldom take 
into account the needs and preferences of the older adults in low-resource rural 
areas. Thus, this study aims to develop a D-MBAT program based on 
person-centered and community-engaged approach to maximize the mental health 
service of rural older adults with depressive symptoms.A successful D-MBAT 
program would be a feasible and scalable approach to the management of prevalent 
mental health conditions of rural older adults in resource-limited Western 
Hunan.

BACKGROUND: The current pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol will 
comprehensively describe the implementation of a culturally adapted Filipino 
version of the World Health Organization Step-by-Step (SbS-F) program, unguided 
online psychological intervention for people with depression based on behavioral 
activation, among overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Macao (Special 
Administrative Region). The main objective of this pilot study is to explore the 
preliminary effectiveness of the SbS-F program to decrease participant-reported 
depressive symptoms compared to enhanced care as usual (ECAU); and the secondary 
objectives are to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the SbS-F to decrease 
participant-reported anxiety symptoms and improve wellbeing, and to evaluate the 
potential for SbS-F implementation in real-world settings.
METHODS: This trial will follow an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 
trial design and utilize the Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, 
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to accelerate the translation 
of clinical research into more effective implementation strategies and policies. 
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to control and treatment groups. Control 
group participants will receive ECAU that consists of brief depression 
psychoeducation and referral to local community partners. Treatment group 
participants will receive a 5-session of digital intervention through a mobile 
phone application. The primary outcome (depression) and psychological secondary 
outcomes (anxiety symptoms and wellbeing) will be measured using validated 
instruments. To evaluate study implementation, an embedded mixed-methods design 
will be used to collect data from various stakeholders. Data then will be 
analyzed using intention to treat principle and reported following the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide important new knowledge about the 
preliminary effectiveness of SbS-F, a mobile application, as a digital mental 
health intervention and its scalability. If SbS-F shows positive results among 
OFWs in Macao, it has strong potential to be used by OFWs in other countries 
that may also experience depression and difficulty accessing mental health 
services.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions for young people offer a 
promising avenue for promoting mental well-being and addressing mental health 
issues in this population.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore the range of digital mental 
health interventions available for young people aged 16-25 years, with a 
particular focus on digital tool types, modalities, delivery formats, target 
populations, and study retention rates.
METHODS: The scoping review was conducted in 6 databases (PubMed, Web of 
Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsychInfo). Studies were 
included if they were published from 2019 to 2024 in English, reported on a 
population of young people aged 16-25 years, and included validated mental 
health or well-being outcome measures. All types of digital interventions from 
promotion and prevention to treatment of mental health were included.
RESULTS: After screening 13,306 articles, 145 articles were included in the 
final review. The findings reveal a diverse landscape of studies, equally 
focusing on the prevention and promotion of mental health and the treatment of 
mental ill health, most commonly using cognitive behavioral therapy (63/145, 
43.4%). The most common digital tools were apps (51/135, 37.8%), web-based 
resources (45/135, 33.3%), and websites (19/135, 14.1%). The results highlight 
the over emphasis on convenience sampling (140/145, 96.6%), with participants 
mainly recruited from universities or colleges, and a lack of representation 
from marginalized groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer youth; those from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds; and those who 
are neurodivergent. Moreover, the focus on anxiety and depression leaves other 
mental health conditions underrepresented. Retention rates ranged from 16% to 
100% and averaged 66% across all studies.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more research on mental health promotion and 
prevention measures among those aged younger than 25 years as young people are 
at increased risk of mental health issues. This includes exploring different 
intervention approaches and modalities beyond cognitive behavioral therapy and 
ensuring inclusivity in study populations. Standardizing intervention durations 
and incorporating long-term follow-up data could provide valuable insights into 
the efficacy and effectiveness of digital interventions. Future studies should 
aim for greater inclusivity, ensuring representation from marginalized groups to 
address the diverse mental health needs of young people effectively. By adopting 
these approaches, digital mental health interventions can become more 
accessible, engaging, and impactful for young people worldwide.

Introduction: Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high 
level of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to find helpful coping 
mechanisms. Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular 
treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. 
The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness 
meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that 
are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly 
assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone 
intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to 
engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive 
restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of 
depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, 
and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track 
their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for 
between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case 
analyses. Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this 
randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group 
differences for depressive symptoms (d = -0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). 
Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) 
such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, 
mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification 
were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional 
regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in 
stress (d = -0.52) and anxiety symptoms (d = -0.47) was also observed in the 
intervention group. Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that 
promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging 
with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, 
self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce 
overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their 
thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying 
stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping 
strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which 
may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting 
situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Despite the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in minimizing 
psychosocial morbidity in breast cancer survivors (BCSs), intervention delivery 
across survivorship is limited by physical, organizational, and attitudinal 
barriers, which contribute to a mental health care treatment gap in cancer 
settings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop iNNOV Breast Cancer (iNNOVBC), a 
guided, internet-delivered, individually tailored, acceptance and commitment 
therapy-influenced cognitive behavioral intervention program aiming to treat 
mild to moderate anxiety and depression in BCSs as well as to improve fatigue, 
insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and health-related quality of life in this group. 
This study also aims to evaluate the usefulness, usability, and preliminary 
feasibility of iNNOVBC.
METHODS: iNNOVBC was developed using a user-centered design approach involving 
its primary and secondary end users, that is, BCSs (11/24, 46%) and mental 
health professionals (13/24, 54%). We used mixed methods, namely in-depth 
semistructured interviews, laboratory-based usability tests, short-term field 
trials, and surveys, to assess iNNOVBC's usefulness, usability, and preliminary 
feasibility among these target users. Descriptive statistics were used to 
characterize the study sample, evaluate performance data, and assess survey 
responses. Qualitative data were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and 
thematically analyzed.
RESULTS: Overall, participants considered iNNOVBC highly useful, with most 
participants reporting on the pertinence of its scope, the digital format, the 
relevant content, and the appropriate features. However, various usability 
issues were identified, and participants suggested that the program should be 
refined by simplifying navigation paths, using a more dynamic color scheme, 
including more icons and images, displaying information in different formats and 
versions, and developing smartphone and tablet versions. In addition, 
participants suggested that tables should be converted into plain textboxes and 
data visualization dashboards should be included to facilitate the tracking of 
progress. The possibility of using iNNOVBC in a flexible manner, tailoring it 
according to BCSs' changing needs and along the cancer care continuum, was 
another suggestion that was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that iNNOVBC is considered useful by both 
BCSs and mental health professionals, configuring a promising point-of-need 
solution to bridge the psychological supportive care gap experienced by BCSs 
across the survivorship trajectory. We believe that our results may be 
applicable to other similar programs. However, to fulfill their full supportive 
role, such programs should be comprehensive, highly usable, and tailorable and 
must adopt a flexible yet integrated structure capable of evolving in accordance 
with survivors' changing needs and the cancer continuum.

Depression affects 8.1% of the German population annually, yet many patients 
remain resistant to conventional treatments. Given that 85% of individuals with 
depression also experience chronic insomnia, sleep may represent both a 
contributing and modifiable treatment factor. This study examines whether adding 
a fully automated digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) to 
care-as-usual (CAU) improves depressive symptoms. Participants with comorbid 
depression and insomnia were randomized to either the intervention group 
(dCBT-I) or the waiting group (WLC). The intervention was delivered via a mobile 
app or web platform, consisting of 10 sequential core modules based on 
evidence-based CBT-I techniques. Assessments took place at baseline, 12- and 
24-weeks post randomization. The primary outcome was the severity of depressive 
symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes included 
insomnia severity, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, well-being and mechanistic 
effect measures. Linear mixed models were calculated to determine between-group 
effects. A total of 140 participants (120 women, mean age: M = 39.76 ± 11.65 
years) were randomized to dCBT-I (n=70) or WLC (n=70). Large treatment effects 
at 12- and 24 weeks showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms (-3.34 
and -2.83; ps <0.001; ds = 0.66-0.78) in the dCBT-I group. Treatment effects in 
favor of dCBT-I were also found for insomnia severity (ds = 1.46-1.94) and most 
secondary outcomes (ds = 0.33-1.14). This study demonstrates that digital dCBT-I 
can be effective not only for individuals with primary insomnia but also for 
those with depression. These findings align with previous research, highlighting 
the crucial role of sleep disturbances in depression management. Moreover, the 
effects remained stable even in the heterogeneous sample investigated in this 
study, reinforcing the robustness of dCBT-I across diverse patient groups. Thus, 
dCBT-I emerges as a promising adjunctive treatment. Considering these findings, 
it is essential to explore the integration of sleep-focused interventions into 
standard depression treatment. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trial

INTRODUCTION: Insomnia has a remarkably negative effect on the work, quality of 
life and psychosomatic health of individuals, and imposes a substantial economic 
burden on society. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have proven beneficial 
in the treatment of insomnia. However, the effect of mobile or online-based 
(mHealth) MBIs requires further verification. This study will evaluate the 
effectiveness of an mHealth MBI, 'Mindful Living with Insomnia' (MLWI), relative 
to that of mHealth cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is an mHealth, randomised controlled trial. Two 
hundred and fifty participants will be allocated randomly and equally to either 
the MLWI or CBT-I group. The intervention will involve 12 sessions over a 6-week 
course, with 2, 30 min sessions per week. The primary outcomes are sleep 
quality, severity of insomnia symptoms and sleep activity, according to the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index and sleep tracker Mi 
Smart Band, respectively. The secondary outcomes are perceived stress, anxiety, 
depression and mindfulness. Outcomes will be evaluated at the baseline, end of 
the intervention period and at the 3-month follow-up. Data analyses will include 
covariance, regression analysis, χ2, t-test and Pearson's correlations. 
Participants will be recruited from January to June 2022, or until the 
recruitment process is complete. The follow-up will be completed in December 
2022. All trial results should be available by the end of December 2022.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full approval for this study has been obtained from 
the Ethics Committee at The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 
Changsha, China (21010). Study results will be disseminated via social media and 
peer-reviewed publications.

BACKGROUND: Internet-cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression can 
include multiple components. This study explored depressive symptom improvement 
prognostic factors (PFs) and effect modifiers (EMs) for five common iCBT 
components including behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, problem 
solving, self-monitoring, and assertion training.
METHODS: We used data from a factorial trial of iCBT for subthreshold depression 
among Japanese university students (N = 1093). The primary outcome was the 
change in PHQ-9 scores at 8 weeks from baseline. Interactions between each 
component and various baseline characteristics were estimated using a 
mixed-effects model for repeated measures. We calculated multiplicity-adjusted 
p-values at 5 % false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
RESULTS: After multiplicity adjustment, the baseline PHQ-9 total score emerged 
as a PF and exercise habits as an EM for self-monitoring (adjusted p-values 
<0.05). The higher the PHQ-9 total score at baseline (range: 5-14), the greater 
the decrease after 8 weeks. For each 5-point increase at baseline, the change 
from baseline to 8 weeks was bigger by 2.8 points. The more frequent the 
exercise habits (range: 0-2 points), the less effective the self-monitoring 
component. The difference in PHQ-9 change scores between presence or absence of 
self-monitoring was smaller by 0.94 points when the participant exercised one 
level more frequently. Additionally, the study suggested seven out of 36 PFs and 
14 out of 160 EMs examined were candidates for future research.
LIMITATIONS: Generalizability is limited to university students with 
subthreshold depression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide some helpful information for the future 
development of individualized iCBT algorithms for depression.

BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience significant 
medical and psychological stressors that affect their mental health, well-being, 
and disease outcomes. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used 
in other patient populations and has demonstrated clinical benefits. Although 
evidence-based, nonpharmacological interventions for pain management are widely 
used in other populations, these treatments have not been well studied in SCD. 
Currently, there are no adequately powered large-scale clinical trials to 
evaluate the effectiveness and dissemination potential of behavioral pain 
management for adults with SCD. Furthermore, some important details regarding 
behavioral therapies in SCD remain unclear-in particular, what works best for 
whom and when.
OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of two 
smartphone-delivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms: digital CBT versus 
pain and SCD education (Education). Our secondary goal is to assess whether 
baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain 
outcomes. We hypothesize that digital CBT will confer greater benefits on pain 
outcomes and depressive symptoms at 6 months and a greater reduction in health 
care use (eg, opioid prescriptions or refills or acute care visits) over 12 
months.
METHODS: The CaRISMA (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management 
Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications) study is a multisite 
comparative effectiveness trial funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute. CaRISMA is conducted at six clinical academic sites, in partnership 
with four community-based organizations. CaRISMA will evaluate the effectiveness 
of two 12-week health coach-supported digital health programs with a total of 
350 participants in two groups: CBT (n=175) and Education (n=175). Participants 
will complete a series of questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. 
The primary outcome will be the change in pain interference between the study 
arms. We will also evaluate changes in pain intensity, depressive symptoms, 
other patient-reported outcomes, and health care use as secondary outcomes. We 
have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.37 SDs between study arms on 6-month 
changes in the outcomes with 15% expected attrition at 6 months. An exploratory 
analysis will examine whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect 
of the intervention on pain interference.
RESULTS: This study will be conducted from March 2021 through February 2022, 
with results expected to be available in February 2023.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD experience significant disease burden, 
psychosocial stress, and impairment of their quality of life. CaRISMA proposes 
to leverage digital technology and overcome barriers to the routine use of 
behavioral treatments for pain and depressive symptoms in the treatment of 
adults with SCD. The study will provide data on the comparative effectiveness of 
digital CBT and Education approaches and evaluate the potential for implementing 
evidence-based behavioral interventions to manage SCD pain.

Depression is highly prevalent among university students. Internet-based 
interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, 
but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic 
stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs 
provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non-specific 
intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of 
depression (CES-D ≥ 16) of a large distance-learning university were randomly 
assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress intervention group (IG; 
n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet-based 
psychoeducational program of equal length. Self-report data was assessed at 
baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks) and three-month follow-up. The primary 
outcome was depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included 
mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found 
significant between-group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% 
CI: 0.08-0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30-0.91), 
perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18-0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 
0.03-0.67) and other secondary outcomes post-treatment. Effects on depression 
were sustained at three-month follow-up. Response rates for depressive symptoms 
were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post-test (χ 
2=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three-month follow-up (p = 0.454). We also found 
significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment 
(follow-up; d = 0.36), work output (post-treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback 
(follow-up; d = 0.36). The intervention was more effective for depressive 
symptoms compared to the CG, and so controlling for unspecific intervention 
effects. This suggests that specific techniques of the intervention may provide 
significant additional benefits on depressive symptoms. Trial registration:

BACKGROUND: Mobile applications for mental health have the potential to aid 
people with mental health disorders, especially depression, by providing them 
with tools and coping mechanisms. Adolescents and young adults, being at risk of 
depressive symptoms and leading mobile users, are among the main targets of 
using mobile applications to alleviate symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of mobile application-based 
psychological interventions in reducing depression symptoms in adolescents and 
young adults compared to those not exposed to the intervention.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis focusing on mobile applications for 
reducing depressive symptoms. We searched two databases: MEDLINE and EMBASE and 
included randomized controlled trials conducted in English among participants 
aged 18-35 years old who were assessed for depressive symptoms using a validated 
screening measure and used mobile applications-based psychological 
interventions. Two of six independent reviewers conducted study selection, data 
extraction, and bias assessment. A pooled mean standardized difference (Cohen's 
d) and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias 
was assessed using I2 statistics and forest plot. Egger's test was used for 
assessing publication bias.
RESULTS: After screening 740 references, we identified 12 trials with 1869 
participants, with a mean age of participants ranging from 14.70 to 25.1 years. 
The interventions ranged from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile 
apps to interactive story-telling apps and apps delivering a mix of CBT, 
interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents, and dialectical behavior therapy 
elements. Control groups included information-only, waitlist, no intervention, 
and treatment as usual. Seven studies used Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9) to assess the severity of depressive symptoms, while the other five used 
different scales. There was no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.325). The 
mobile applications reduced depression score by 0.08 units of standardized 
difference more than the control, with a 95% CI of -0.19 to 0.03 (p = 0.294, 
I2 = 15.4%) using standardized mean difference (SMD) as the effect estimate. In 
a sensitivity analysis including only studies that used PHQ-9, we found a 
similar trend, SMD -0.72 (95%CI -1.48 to 0.03). However, both findings were not 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to support mobile applications to 
relieve depression symptoms in adolescents and young adults. Further trials with 
larger sample size are needed to confirm our findings of a positive trend. With 
emerging technologies and the high exposure of apps in this population, mobile 
applications for depression hold promise for the future of treatment and 
awareness of mental health disorders in this population.

BACKGROUND: Unmet pediatric mental health (MH) needs are growing as rates of 
pediatric depression and anxiety dramatically increase. Access to care is 
limited by multiple factors, including a shortage of clinicians trained in 
developmentally specific, evidence-based services. Novel approaches to MH care 
delivery, including technology-leveraged and readily accessible options, need to 
be evaluated in service of expanding evidence-based services to youths and their 
families. Preliminary evidence supports the use of Woebot, a relational agent 
that digitally delivers guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through a 
mobile app, for adults with MH concerns. However, no studies have evaluated the 
feasibility and acceptability of such app-delivered relational agents 
specifically for adolescents with depression and/or anxiety within an outpatient 
MH clinic, nor compared them to other MH support services.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial 
evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of an investigational device, 
Woebot for Adolescents (W-GenZD), within an outpatient MH clinic for youths 
presenting with depression and/or anxiety. The study's secondary aim will 
compare the clinical outcomes of self-reported depressive symptoms with W-GenZD 
and a telehealth-delivered CBT-based skills group (CBT-group). Tertiary aims 
will evaluate additional clinical outcomes and therapeutic alliance between 
adolescents in W-GenZD and the CBT-group.
METHODS: Participants include youths aged 13-17 years with depression and/or 
anxiety seeking care from an outpatient MH clinic at a children's hospital. 
Eligible youths will have no recent safety concerns or complex comorbid clinical 
diagnoses; have no concurrent individual therapy; and, if on medications, are on 
stable doses, based on clinical screening and as well as study-specific 
criteria.
RESULTS: Recruitment began in May 2022. As of December 8, 2022, we have 
randomized 133 participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishing the feasibility and acceptability of W-GenZD within an 
outpatient MH clinical setting will add to the field's current understanding of 
the utility and implementation considerations of this MH care service modality. 
The study will also evaluate the noninferiority of W-GenZD against the 
CBT-group. Findings may also have implications for patients, families, and 
providers looking for additional MH support options for adolescents seeking help 
for their depression and/or anxiety. Such options expand the menu of supports 
for youths with lower-intensity needs as well as possibly reduce waitlists and 
optimize clinician deployment toward more severe cases.

BACKGROUND: The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their leisure 
time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet gaming disorder 
(IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. 
It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD 
may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep 
problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased 
violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a 
transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field 
of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In 
addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more 
aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral 
change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based 
intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents.
METHOD: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school 
adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible 
adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. 
Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT 
will be delivered through the `app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. 
The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive 
sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet 
Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress 
Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The 
study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 
3 months after the intervention.
DISCUSSION: The results of this intervention could be used as adjunct therapy 
for adolescents with IGD.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence in mobile health has demonstrated that, in some 
cases, apps are an effective way to improve health care delivery. Health care 
interventions delivered via mobile technology have demonstrated both 
practicality and affordability. Lately, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
interventions delivered over the internet have also shown a meaningful impact on 
patients with anxiety and depression.
OBJECTIVE: Given the growing proliferation of smartphones and the trust in apps 
to support improved health behaviors and outcomes, we were interested in 
comparing a mobile app with Web-based methods for the delivery of CBT. This 
study aimed to compare the usability of a CBT mobile app called MoodTrainer with 
an evidence-based website called MoodGYM.
METHODS: We used convenience sampling to recruit 30 students from a large 
Midwestern university and randomly assigned them to either the MoodGYM or 
MoodTrainer user group. The trial period ran for 2 weeks, after which the 
students completed a self-assessment survey based on Nielsen heuristics. 
Statistical analysis was performed to compare the survey results from the 2 
groups. We also compared the number of modules attempted or completed and the 
time spent on CBT strategies.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the MoodTrainer app received a higher 
usability score when compared with MoodGYM. Overall, 87% (13/15) of the 
participants felt that it was easy to navigate through the MoodTrainer app 
compared with 80% (12/15) of the MoodGYM participants. All MoodTrainer 
participants agreed that the app was easy to use and did not require any 
external assistance, whereas only 67% (10/15) had the same opinion for MoodGYM. 
Furthermore, 67% (10/15) of the MoodTrainer participants found that the 
navigation controls were easy to locate compared with 80% (12/15) of the MoodGYM 
participants. MoodTrainer users, on average, completed 2.5 modules compared with 
1 module completed by MoodGYM users.
CONCLUSIONS: As among the first studies to directly compare the usability of a 
mobile app-based CBT with smartphone-specific features against a Web-based CBT, 
there is an opportunity for app-based CBT as, at least in our limited trial, it 
was more usable and engaging. The study was limited to evaluate usability only 
and not the clinical effectiveness of the app.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a major public health concern. Emerging research has 
shown that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in 
treating individuals with comorbid insomnia and depression. Traditional 
face-to-face CBT-I encounters many obstacles related to feasibility, 
accessibility, and help-seeking stigma. CBT-I delivered via smartphone 
application could be a potential solution. This paper reports a protocol 
designed to evaluate the efficacy of a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I, using a 
waitlist group as control, for people with major depression and insomnia.
METHODS: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial is conducted in a target 
sample of 285 non-suicidal Hong Kong Chinese older than 17 years of age with 
major depression and insomnia. Participants complete an online rapid screening, 
followed by a telephone diagnostic interview. Those who meet the eligibility 
criteria are randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either CBT-I immediately or 
to a waitlist control condition. The CBT-I consists of six weekly modules and is 
delivered through a smartphone application proACT-S. This smartphone app has 
been pilot tested and revamped to improve user experience. An online randomized 
algorithm is used to perform randomization to ensure allocation concealment. The 
primary outcomes are changes over the measurement points in sleep quality, 
insomnia severity, and depression severity. The secondary outcomes include 
changes over the measurement points in anxiety, subjective health, treatment 
expectancy, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments are administered at 
baseline, post-intervention, and 6-week follow-up. The recruitment is completed. 
Important adverse events, if any, are documented. Multilevel linear mixed model 
based on intention-to-treat principle will be conducted to examine the efficacy 
of the CBT-I intervention.
DISCUSSION: It is expected that proACT-S is an efficacious brief sleep-focused 
self-help treatment for people with major depression and insomnia. If proven 
efficacious, due to its self-help nature, proACT-S may be applicable as a 
community-based early intervention, thereby reducing the burden of the public 
healthcare system in Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: Evidence shows that computerized self-help interventions are 
effective for reducing symptoms of depression. One such intervention, SPARX, is 
a gamified mobile computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) developed for 
adolescents in New Zealand, which was shown to be as effective as usual care for 
young people with mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression. However, gamified 
cCBT has not yet been tested in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: This trial is designed to investigate whether a Japanese-adapted 
version of SPARX improves depressive symptoms in Japanese university students 
with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms.
METHODS: In this 7-week, multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, superiority 
randomized trial, participants will be allocated to either a treatment condition 
(SPARX) or a wait-list control condition. SPARX is a fully automated program, 
which will be delivered to the mobile phone or tablet device of the 
participants. SPARX is designed as an interactive fantasy game to guide the user 
through seven modules that teach key CBT strategies. All participants will be 
recruited from universities via advertisements on online bulletin boards, the 
campus newspaper, and posters. Participants in the treatment condition will use 
the SPARX program weekly. The primary outcome is the reduction of depressive 
symptoms (using Patient Health Questionnaires-9) measured at baseline and 
weekly: once after the 7-week intervention and once at a 1-month follow-up. 
Secondary outcomes include satisfaction with the program and satisfaction with 
life, measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale; positive and negative moods, 
measured by the Profile of Mood States Second Edition; social functioning, 
measured by the EuroQol Instrument; rumination, measured by the Ruminative 
Responses Scale; and coping, measured by the Brief Coping Orientation to Problem 
Experienced Inventory.
RESULTS: This study received funding from The Research Institute of Personalized 
Health Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, and obtained 
institutional review board approval in September 2019. Data collection began in 
April 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial may provide further evidence for the efficacy 
of gamified cCBT for the treatment of depression and, specifically, provide 
support for using SPARX with Japanese university students.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of mobile applications (apps) 
designed to support patients progressing through an evidence-based 
psychotherapy. Prolonged exposure (PE) is an efficacious treatment for 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PE Coach is a treatment companion app 
that may increase patient engagement with the active components of PE, thereby 
supporting recovery.
METHODS: This paper describes a randomized clinical trial that will evaluate PE 
delivered with and without PE Coach at post-treatment, and 1-month and 4-months 
post-treatment. Veterans with PTSD (N = 124) will be randomized (1:1) to 
conditions and complete up to 15 treatment sessions based on a priori defined 
termination criteria. We hypothesize that compared to PE without PE Coach, PE 
with the app will result in greater improvements in PTSD-related social and 
occupational functioning (primary outcome is the PTSD-Related Functioning 
Inventory), quality of life, and greater reductions in functional impairment, 
neurobehavioral symptoms, depression, and suicidal ideation (Aim 1). We also 
hypothesize that including PE Coach will reduce assessor-masked PTSD symptom 
severity, relative to PE without the app, as assessed by the revised 
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (Aim 2). We hypothesize that PE 
Coach will facilitate increased treatment adherence, as measured by completion 
of PE homework (Aim 3). We will explore the impact of PE Coach on treatment 
engagement, as measured by reduced treatment dropout.
CONCLUSION: Data on the outcomes of PE Coach can inform dissemination efforts 
and help evaluate the return on investment to guide future mental health app 
development.

BACKGROUND: Work-related stress is a risk factor for a number of adverse health 
and work outcomes. Resilience trainings are a promising approach for adequately 
dealing with work stress and keeping employees mentally healthy. However, 
results of previous resilience trainings have been heterogeneous, ranging from 
null findings to large effects. Existing digital resilience interventions show a 
lack of consistency in terms of an underlying theoretical framework and methods 
used to foster resilience. Positive Appraisal Style Theory of Resilience offers 
an innovative conceptualization of resilience. Strengths-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy is a corresponding therapeutically method reflecting 
resilience as a resource-oriented process of dealing with stress. Based on this 
background, a new hybrid web-and app-based digital resilience intervention for 
employees named RESIST was developed.
OBJECTIVE: The first aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of the 
newly developed training RESIST regarding its usability, user behavior, user 
experience and motivation to use. Second, the study sought to explore 
preliminary effects of the intervention on reducing stress and enhancing 
resilience by conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: The feasibility study was conducted in three phases. First, the 
usability of the app was investigated in a pre-test with five participants using 
a thinking-aloud method. Second, the preliminary efficacy of the training was 
examined in a pilot randomized controlled trial. A sample of 30 employees were 
randomized either to receive the resilience training (n = 15) or to be member of 
a control group (n = 15). The primary outcome was measuring perceived stress. 
Secondary outcomes included measures of resilience and depressive symptoms. 
Third, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with six participants of the 
resilience training group on training content, motivation for use, and user 
experience.
RESULTS: Overall, results indicate that RESIST can be a feasible training for 
resilience promotion and stress reduction with high user satisfaction. Analysis 
of covariance showed that, relative to controls, participants who received 
RESIST reported significantly lower stress scores at post-intervention 
(F1,27 = 16.91, p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.57; 95 % CI 0.71-2.43) than controls. 
Significant differences, with moderate-to-large effect sizes, were also detected 
for general resilience and various resilience factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are promising and provide hope that a hybrid web- and 
app-based resilience intervention based on strengths-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy can have a positive impact on dealing adequately with stress and improve 
resilience of employees.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating mental health disorder, with a large 
treatment gap. Recent years have seen a surge in digital interventions to bridge 
this treatment gap. Most of these interventions are based on computerized 
cognitive behavioral therapy. Despite the efficacy of computerized cognitive 
behavioral therapy-based interventions, their uptake is low and dropout rates 
are high. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigms provide a complementary 
approach to digital interventions for depression. However, interventions based 
on CBM paradigms have been reported to be repetitive and boring.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we described the conceptualization, design, and 
acceptability of serious games based on CBM paradigms and the learned 
helplessness paradigm.
METHODS: We searched the literature for CBM paradigms that were shown to be 
effective in reducing depressive symptoms. For each of the CBM paradigms, we 
ideated how to create a game so that the gameplay was engaging while the active 
therapeutic component remained unchanged.
RESULTS: We developed 5 serious games based on the CBM paradigms and the learned 
helplessness paradigm. The games include various core elements of gamification, 
such as goals, challenges, feedback, rewards, progress, and fun. Overall, the 
games received positive acceptability ratings from 15 users.
CONCLUSIONS: These games may help improve the effectiveness and engagement 
levels of computerized interventions for depression.

BACKGROUND: Minorities have an increased incidence of early-onset, 
obesity-related cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, effective weight 
management in this vulnerable population has significant barriers.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the feasibility and preliminary 
treatment effects of a smartphone-based weight loss intervention versus food 
journals to monitor dietary patterns in minority stroke patients.
METHODS: Swipe out Stroke was a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial 
with open blinded end point. Minority stroke patients and their caregivers were 
screened for participation using cluster enrollment. We used adaptive 
randomization for assignment to a behavior intervention with (1) 
smartphone-based self-monitoring or (2) food journal self-monitoring. The 
smartphone group used Lose it! to record meals and communicate with us. Reminder 
messages (first 30 days), weekly summaries plus reminder messages on missed days 
(days 31-90), and weekly summaries only (days 91-180) were sent via push 
notifications. The food journal group used paper diaries. Both groups received 4 
in-person visits (baseline and 30, 90, and 180 days), culturally competent 
counseling, and educational materials. The primary outcome was reduced total 
body weight.
RESULTS: We enrolled 36 stroke patients (n=23, 64% African American; n=13, 36% 
Hispanic), 17 in the smartphone group, and 19 in the food journal group. Mean 
age was 54 (SD 9) years; mean body mass index was 35.7 (SD 5.7) kg/m2; 
education, employment status, and family history of stroke or obesity did not 
differ between the groups. Baseline rates of depression (Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score median 5.5, IQR 3.0-9.5), cognitive impairment 
(Montreal Cognitive Assessment score median 23.5, IQR 21-26), and inability to 
ambulate (5/36, 14% with modified Rankin Scale score 3) were similar. In total, 
25 (69%) stroke survivors completed Swipe out Stroke (13/17 in the smartphone 
group, 12/19 in the food journal group); 1 participant in the smartphone group 
died. Median weight change at 180 days was 5.7 lb (IQR -2.4 to 8.0) in the 
smartphone group versus 6.4 lb (IQR -2.2 to 12.5; P=.77) in the food journal 
group. Depression was significantly lower at 30 days in the smartphone group 
than in the food journal group (PHQ-9 score 2 vs 8; P=.03). Clinically relevant 
depression rates remained in the zero to minimal range for the smartphone group 
compared with mild to moderate range in the food journal group at day 90 (PHQ-9 
score 3.5 vs 4.5; P=.39) and day 180 (PHQ-9 score 3 vs 6; P=.12).
CONCLUSIONS: In a population of obese minority stroke survivors, the use of a 
smartphone did not lead to a significant difference in weight change compared 
with keeping a food journal. The presence of baseline depression (19/36, 53%) 
was a confounding variable, which improved with app engagement. Future studies 
that include treatment of poststroke depression may positively influence 
intervention efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: The Student Bodies-Eating Disorders intervention (SB-ED), a digital 
cognitive behavior therapy-guided self-help intervention for college women with 
an eating disorder, is effective for reducing eating disorder psychopathology. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate moderators and mediators of the SB-ED 
intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of clinical 
mediators of a digital intervention for women with eating disorders.
METHOD: This is an exploratory secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial 
comparing the SB-ED intervention to referral to usual care among 690 women at 27 
United States colleges. Moderators included body mass index (BMI), race, 
ethnicity, weight/shape concerns, eating disorder impairment, thin ideal 
internalization, depression, anxiety, and motivation for treatment, assessed at 
baseline. Thin ideal internalization and depressive symptoms were tested as 
predictors at postintervention and mediators at 2-year follow-up. Outcome was 
change in global eating disorder psychopathology.
RESULTS: BMI moderated the effect of the intervention at follow-up (but not 
posttreatment), with individuals with a lower BMI experiencing more continued 
improvements in eating disorder psychopathology following the intervention than 
individuals with a higher BMI. Thin ideal internalization mediated the effect of 
the intervention at follow-up, and depression partially mediated the effect of 
the intervention at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of the mediator analyses suggest that helping college women 
reduce inflated internalization of the thin ideal and improve depressive 
symptoms leads to improvements in eating disorder psychopathology. Results also 
suggest opportunities to optimize the intervention so individuals across the BMI 
spectrum experience ongoing improvements over time. (PsycInfo Database Record

BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a widespread and significant problem on college 
campuses. Prolonged loneliness in young adulthood is a risk factor for 
concurrent and future mental health problems and attrition, making college a 
critical time for support. Cognitive and behavioral interventions show promise 
for decreasing loneliness and can be widely disseminated through technology.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the 
initial efficacy, feasibility, and desirability of a smartphone app, Nod, 
designed to deliver cognitive and behavioral skill-building exercises to reduce 
loneliness during the transition to college.
METHODS: First-year college students (N=221, mean age 18.7 years, 59% female) 
were recruited online during incoming student orientation, and randomized to 
either receive immediate access to Nod (experimental group, n=100) or access 
after 4 weeks (control group, n=121). The app delivered skills via fully 
automated (1) "social challenges," suggested activities designed to build social 
connections; (2) reflections, brief cognitive reframing exercises; and (3) 
student testimonials that encouraged a growth mindset toward social connection 
building. Main intention-to-treat analyses were used to compare the conditions 
on self-assessed loneliness, depressive symptoms, and other mental health and 
college adjustment outcomes at week 4, controlling for baseline values on those 
variables. Analyses were also performed to test the hypothesis that the 
treatment benefits would be particularly pronounced for participants with 
heightened psychological vulnerability at baseline (ie, higher baseline 
depressive symptoms and loneliness).
RESULTS: Retention was 97% at week 4, and participants viewed an average 36.7 
pages of app content. There were no significant condition differences in 
loneliness at week 4 (F1, 211=0.05, P=.82; ηp2 <.001). However, there was a 
significant condition-by-baseline depression interaction to predict week-4 
loneliness (F1,209=9.65, P=.002; ηp2 =.04). Simple slope analyses indicated that 
baseline depression positively predicted week-4 loneliness among control 
participants (r=0.30, t209=3.81, P<.001), but not among experimental 
participants (r=-0.09, t209=-0.84, P=.40), suggesting that Nod buffered 
participants with high baseline depression scores from experiencing heightened 
midquarter loneliness. Similarly, there were no significant condition 
differences in other week-4 outcomes. However, moderation by baseline 
vulnerability was found for week-4 depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and 
indices of college adjustment (eg, perceived social support and campus 
belonging).
CONCLUSIONS: Although Nod exposure did not impact outcomes for the full sample, 
these results provide initial evidence of its benefit for vulnerable students. 
The results of this trial suggest that cognitive and behavioral skills delivered 
via a mobile app can buffer psychologically vulnerable college students against 
heightened loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as other negative college 
adjustment outcomes. Future work will aim to improve upon app engagement, and to 
address loneliness among other key populations.

BACKGROUND: Employment plays an important role in the maintenance of mental and 
physical health. Losing a job creates emotional distress, which can, in turn, 
interfere with effective job seeking. Thus, a program for job seekers that 
provides support for both the logistics of job seeking as well as emotional 
distress may help people find employment and improve emotional well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the efficacy of the 6-week intervention for 
job seekers in a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: This is a parallel-assignment randomized control trial comparing a 
6-week return-to-work intervention versus job seeking as usual for a stratified 
sample of job seekers (n=150). The intervention will be delivered through a 
mobile phone app and scheduled video counseling sessions with a job coach. 
Assessments will be taken weekly during the intervention as well as 8 and 16 
weeks later. The intervention and control group procedures will be administered 
remotely, allowing the study to take place in several regions of the United 
States. Eligible participants will be adults aged 18 to 65 years, currently 
unemployed, and actively searching for work. Participants will be recruited from 
7 major metropolitan areas in the United States using online advertisements on 
Craigslist. The primary outcome measure is the Job Search Behavior Scale, which 
has 2 subscales, preparatory job search behavior and active job search behavior. 
Employment status will also be assessed throughout the trial. A mixed-model 
regression analysis will be used to compare job searching behavior in the 
intervention group versus the control group. A time-to-event analysis (ie, 
survival analysis) will be used to compare employment status in the 2 
experimental groups. Secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including job 
search self-efficacy and mental health-related outcomes such as anxiety and 
depression.
RESULTS: This study started on August 7, 2023, and as of June 2024, we have 
enrolled 140 participants. Enrollment began in August 2023 and will conclude by 
October 2024. Half of the participants (75/150, 50%) will be assigned to the 
intervention arm while the other half (75/150, 50%) will be assigned to the 
control arm, job seeking as usual.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study will determine the efficacy of a 
mobile app-based intervention that uses both job training and psychological 
techniques on job seeking and employment outcomes. This first trial of Distress 
Return-to-Work Intervention (DRIVEN) will provide important information about 
blended support techniques for unemployed individuals, determine the usefulness 
of mobile apps to address large-scale mental health outcomes, and improve our 
understanding of the relationship between depression and unemployment status.

BACKGROUND: Depression in older adults is a challenge for health systems in most 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Digital strategies for the management 
of this condition have been emerging worldwide, but the effectiveness of most of 
them is still unclear, especially among older adults. Thus, we aim to assess the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital psychosocial intervention to 
treat depression among older adults living in socioeconomically deprived areas 
in Guarulhos, Brazil.
METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm individually randomised controlled trial with 
1:1 allocation ratio. Five hundred older adults aged 60 years or over with 
depressive symptomatology (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score, PHQ-9 ≥ 
10) and registered with one of the primary care clinics will be recruited to 
participate in this study. A 6-week digital psychosocial programme, named Viva 
Vida, will be delivered via WhatsApp to participants allocated to the 
intervention arm. The Viva Vida will send psychoeducational and behavioural 
activation audio and visual messages 4 days a week for 6 weeks. The control arm 
will only receive a single message with general information about depression. 
The primary outcome will be the proportion of depression recovery (PHQ-9 < 10) 
assessed at 3 months. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be 
assessed at 5 months. A detailed process evaluation will be used to explore 
context and important implementation outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This programme was based on the PROACTIVE intervention and designed 
to be delivered without face-to-face contact. If effective, it could be a simple 
treatment option, appropriate not only when social distancing is required, but 
it could also be included as a regular public health programme to initiate 
depression treatment, particularly in LMICs where resources allocated to mental 
health are scarce.

The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel 
opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a population scale. 
Despite multi-sector investment along with wide-scale advertising and 
availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of 
smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically 
evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta-analysis of smartphone apps for 
depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 
eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data 
from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more 
from smartphone apps than control conditions (g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52, 
p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a 
moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g=0.56, 95% CI: 
0.38-0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions 
(g=0.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.33). Effects from smartphone-only interventions were 
greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/computerized 
aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not 
statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a 
significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p=0.004) than those of 
apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or 
interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating 
aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect 
sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising 
self-management tool for depression. Future research should aim to distil which 
aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which 
populations.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the worsening of the opioid epidemic, access to quality 
treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) including buprenorphine remains a 
challenge. With the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency, temporary 
regulatory changes and expanded reimbursement for telehealth services allowed 
for the rapid expansion of remote treatment for OUD and increased access to 
buprenorphine, but limited research exists to support this revolutionary shift 
in care delivery. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of a 
novel digital therapeutic intervention for OUD combining buprenorphine and 
behavioral therapy.
METHODS: Adults (n = 27) with OUD received treatment with daily sublingual 
buprenorphine and psychosocial treatment delivered digitally via a smartphone 
app over 12 weeks. Participants were evaluated monthly for continued opioid use, 
medication adherence, anxiety and depression indicators, abstinence 
self-efficacy, craving, and overall well-being, as well as a one-time measure of 
treatment acceptability.
RESULTS: Participants reported increased opioid abstinence days from baseline 
(M = 8.2, SD = 8.6) to 12 weeks per 30 days (M = 24.9, SD = 10.1), t(20) = -6.5, 
p < .000, with strong medication adherence across study waves (96.2%). Anxiety 
and depression indicators, and opioid craving significantly decreased, and 
abstinence self-efficacy and overall well-being significantly increased 
following the intervention. Participants also demonstrated high rates of 
treatment engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: As current public health emergency regulatory changes are reviewed 
for permanency, this feasibility and acceptability study of a novel digital 
therapeutic intervention for OUD including buprenorphine adds to the growing 
evidence that supports maintaining telehealth access for quality OUD treatment.

Tailoring interventions to the individual has been hypothesized to improve 
treatment efficacy. Personalization of target-specific underlying mechanisms 
might improve treatment effects as well as adherence. Data-driven 
personalization of treatment, however, is still in its infancy, especially 
concerning the integration of multiple sources of data-driven advice with shared 
decision-making. This study describes an innovative type of data-driven 
personalization in the context of StayFine, a guided app-based relapse 
prevention intervention for 13- to 21-year-olds in remission of anxiety or 
depressive disorders (n = 74). Participants receive six modules, of which three 
are chosen from five optional modules. Optional modules are Enhancing Positive 
Affect, Behavioral Activation, Exposure, Sleep, and Wellness. All participants 
receive Psycho-Education, Cognitive Restructuring, and a Relapse Prevention 
Plan. The personalization approach is based on four sources: (1) prior diagnoses 
(diagnostic interview), (2) transdiagnostic psychological factors (online 
self-report questionnaires), (3) individual symptom networks (ecological 
momentary assessment, based on a two-week diary with six time points per day), 
and subsequently, (4) patient preference based on shared decision-making with a 
trained expert by experience. This study details and evaluates this innovative 
type of personalization approach, comparing the congruency of advised modules 
between the data-driven sources (1-3) with one another and with the chosen 
modules during the shared decision-making process (4). The results show that 
sources of data-driven personalization provide complementary advice rather than 
a confirmatory one. The indications of the modules Exposure and Behavioral 
Activation were mostly based on the diagnostic interview, Sleep on the 
questionnaires, and Enhancing Positive Affect on the network model. Shared 
decision-making showed a preference for modules improving positive concepts 
rather than combating negative ones, as an addition to the data-driven advice. 
Future studies need to test whether treatment outcomes and dropout rates are 
improved through personalization.

BACKGROUND: Despite the growing evidence indicating the efficacy of digital 
cognitive behavioral interventions (dCBIs) for behavioral health (BH) treatment, 
broad and consistent use of such interventions has been limited by knowledge 
obtained in real-world settings, including factors that impact provider 
uptake/referral. Engaging providers early in the implementation process offers 
an opportunity to explore their needs and behaviors, integrate interventions 
into workflows, and better understand provider setting capabilities.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed providers' views on the feasibility and 
acceptability of delivering a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile 
app in multiple care settings.
METHODS: Participating providers included BH and physical health (PH) providers 
from a women's health center, an outpatient BH clinic, and both rural/urban 
primary care settings. All participating providers cocreated workflows through 
facilitated workshops, including establishing feedback loops between the project 
team and providers and identifying clinical champions at each site. Over a 
12-week period, the providers referred adult patients experiencing anxiety or 
depression to a mobile app-based dCBI, RxWell, and provided other indicated 
treatments as part of usual care. Referrals were completed by the providers 
through the electronic medical record. To better understand facilitators of and 
challenges in integrating RxWell into routine practice and perceptions of 
sustainability, a series of qualitative interviews was conducted. Interview data 
were analyzed to identify major themes using an inductive content analysis 
approach.
RESULTS: A total of 19 provider interviews were conducted to discover motivators 
and barriers for referring RxWell. The providers benefited from a focused 
discussion on how to incorporate the referral process into their workflow, and 
knowing the app content was rooted in evidence. Although the providers believed 
engaging in experiential learning was important, they indicated that more 
education on the digital health coach role and how to monitor patient progress 
is needed. The providers thought patient engagement may be impacted by 
motivation, a lack of comfort using a smartphone, or preference for in-person 
therapy. The providers also expressed enthusiasm in continuing to refer the app. 
They liked the ability to provide patients with support between sessions, to 
have an extra treatment option that teaches BH exercises, and to have a CBT 
treatment option that overcomes barriers (eg, wait times, copays, travel) to 
traditional therapy modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital intervention success in health care settings relies heavily 
on engagement of key stakeholders, such as providers, in both design and 
implementation of the intervention and focused evaluation within intended care 
setting(s). Scaling digital interventions to meet the mental health needs of 
patients in usual care settings leans on thoughtfully constructed and 
streamlined workflows to enable seamless referral of patients by providers. Our 
findings strongly suggest that providers are supportive of digital tool 
integration to support the mental health of patients and endorse its use within 
their routine workflow.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health issues addressed 
by online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) via mobile applications. This study 
introduces Sokoon, a gamified CBT app tailored for Arabic individuals, focusing 
on alleviating depression and anxiety symptoms (DASDs).
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: Evaluate the effectiveness of 
Sokoon in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Assess the usability of 
the intervention through user engagement and adherence to CBT skills.
METHODS: A single-group pre-post design evaluated Sokoon's impact on adults with 
DASDs. In consultation with psychiatrists, Sokoon integrates evidence-based 
skills such as relaxation, gratitude, behavioral activation, and cognitive 
restructuring, represented by planets. Its design incorporates Hexad theory and 
gamification, supported by a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm. The study 
involves 30 participants aged 18-35 (86.7% female), specifically those with mild 
to moderate depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: Based on a sample of 30 participants, Sokoon, a smartphone-based 
intervention, significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety (d = 2.7, 
d = 3.6, p < 0.001). Over a two-week trial, participants experienced a notable 
decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating the effectiveness of the 
model. Sokoon shows potential as a valuable tool for addressing DASDs.
CONCLUSION: Sokoon, the gamified CBT application, offers an innovative approach 
to increasing CBT skills adherence and engagement. By leveraging Hexad theory 
and gamification, Sokoon provides an enjoyable and engaging user experience 
while maintaining the effectiveness of traditional CBT techniques. The study 
findings suggest that Sokoon has a positive impact on reducing symptoms of 
depression and anxiety.

BACKGROUND: This study is one of the first randomized controlled trials 
investigating cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered by a 
fully automated mobile phone app. Such an app can potentially increase the 
accessibility of insomnia treatment for the 10% of people who have insomnia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of CBT-I 
delivered via the Sleepcare mobile phone app, compared with a waitlist control 
group, in a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: We recruited participants in the Netherlands with relatively mild 
insomnia disorder. After answering an online pretest questionnaire, they were 
randomly assigned to the app (n=74) or the waitlist condition (n=77). The app 
packaged a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction exercise, and 
sleep hygiene and education. The app was fully automated and adjusted itself to 
a participant's progress. Program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, after which 
participants received posttest measurements and a 3-month follow-up. The 
participants in the waitlist condition received the app after they completed the 
posttest questionnaire. The measurements consisted of questionnaires and 7-day 
online diaries. The questionnaires measured insomnia severity, dysfunctional 
beliefs about sleep, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The diary measured 
sleep variables such as sleep efficiency. We performed multilevel analyses to 
study the interaction effects between time and condition.
RESULTS: The results showed significant interaction effects (P<.01) favoring the 
app condition on the primary outcome measures of insomnia severity (d=-0.66) and 
sleep efficiency (d=0.71). Overall, these improvements were also retained in a 
3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy of a fully automated mobile 
phone app in the treatment of relatively mild insomnia. The effects were in the 
range of what is found for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the 
applicability of such technical tools in the treatment of insomnia. Future work 
should examine the generalizability to a more diverse population. Furthermore, 
the separate components of such an app should be investigated. It remains to be 
seen how this app can best be integrated into the current health regimens.

BACKGROUND: The current paper details findings from Elena+: Care for COVID-19, 
an app developed to tackle the collateral damage of lockdowns and social 
distancing, by offering pandemic lifestyle coaching across seven health areas: 
anxiety, loneliness, mental resources, sleep, diet and nutrition, physical 
activity, and COVID-19 information.
METHODS: The Elena+ app functions as a single-arm interventional study, with 
participants recruited predominantly via social media. We used paired samples 
T-tests and within subjects ANOVA to examine changes in health outcome 
assessments and user experience evaluations over time. To investigate the 
mediating role of behavioral activation (i.e., users setting behavioral 
intentions and reporting actual behaviors) we use mixed-effect regression 
models. Free-text entries were analyzed qualitatively.
RESULTS: Results show strong demand for publicly available lifestyle coaching 
during the pandemic, with total downloads (N = 7'135) and 55.8% of downloaders 
opening the app (n = 3,928) with 9.8% completing at least one subtopic (n = 
698). Greatest areas of health vulnerability as assessed with screening measures 
were physical activity with 62% (n = 1,000) and anxiety with 46.5% (n = 760). 
The app was effective in the treatment of mental health; with a significant 
decrease in depression between first (14 days), second (28 days), and third (42 
days) assessments: F2,38 = 7.01, p = 0.003, with a large effect size (η2G = 
0.14), and anxiety between first and second assessments: t54 = 3.7, p = <0.001 
with a medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.499). Those that followed the coaching 
program increased in net promoter score between the first and second assessment: 
t36 = 2.08, p = 0.045 with a small to medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.342). 
Mediation analyses showed that while increasing number of subtopics completed 
increased behavioral activation (i.e., match between behavioral intentions and 
self-reported actual behaviors), behavioral activation did not mediate the 
relationship to improvements in health outcome assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that: (i) there is public demand for chatbot led 
digital coaching, (ii) such tools can be effective in delivering treatment 
success, and (iii) they are highly valued by their long-term user base. As the 
current intervention was developed at rapid speed to meet the emergency pandemic 
context, the future looks bright for other public health focused chatbot-led 
digital health interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic cancer-related fatigue (CCRF) is a complex 
multidimensional problem warranting person-centered care. Providing patients and 
therapists personalized feedback based on network analysis applied to ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA) data could facilitate case conceptualization in 
psycho-oncological care. The aim was to explore patients' and therapists' 
experiences of using an EMA app and personalized feedback based on network 
theory to aid case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care.
METHODS: A n = 5 proof-of-concept study was implemented in routine 
psycho-oncological care. We purposively selected adult cancer patients suffering 
from severe CCRF who were on the waitlist for psycho-oncological care. During a 
3-week period participants filled out the EMA app Energy InSight (fatigue, mood, 
activity, responding, and context) five times a day. Participants received a 
descriptive and network feedback report, which they reflected upon during the 
first therapy sessions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze user experiences.
RESULTS: Patients experienced that filling out the Energy InSight app, as well 
as receiving descriptive and network-based personalized feedback provided them 
with insight into their CCRF. Although therapists experienced the discussion of 
network feedback as challenging, it facilitated the case conceptualization.
DISCUSSION: Using EMA during waitlist for psychological care seemed feasible. 
Patients experienced beneficial effects from filling out the EMA app and talking 
over the personalized feedback reports, which in turn aided case 
conceptualization and personalized care. Based on this evaluation, an improved 
version of the Energy InSight app and a therapist training for providing network 
feedback is developed for implementation in psycho-oncological care.

BACKGROUND: Low-income pregnant patients are at high risk of postpartum 
depression (PPD). Mothers and Babies (MB) is a cognitive behavioral 
therapy-based program that prevents up to 50% of de novo PPD when provided in 
person to low-income Spanish- and English-speaking people who are pregnant 
without depression. MB is limited by the need for trained personnel to support 
it. Transforming MB into a smartphone app may mitigate this key barrier.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use qualitative data from target end users to create and 
optimize MBapp, a novel app centered on the MB program.
METHODS: Draft wireframes of MBapp were created in English and Spanish with 
cognitive behavioral therapy-based modules adapted from MB. These wireframes 
included several features shown previously to sustain app engagement: (1) push 
notifications delivered at participant-preferred times; (2) text-, graphic-, and 
video-based content; and (3) gamification with digital rewards for app 
engagement. English- or Spanish-speaking individuals with public health 
insurance who were between 32 weeks gestation and 6 months post partum and owned 
smartphones were eligible to consent for individual in-depth interviews. 
Individuals with prior or current depression were excluded. Interviews were 
recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and inductive codes to 
characterize opinions about MBapp and perceptions of challenges and facilitators 
of use of MBapp or other perinatal or mental health apps. End user feedback led 
to major modifications to the wireframes. Each of these changes was categorized 
according to the FRAME (Framework for Modification and Adaptation), an 
established method of systematically reporting adaptations and modifications to 
evidence-based interventions via end user feedback. Recruitment ceased with 
content saturation, defined as 3 successive participants providing only positive 
feedback on MBapp's wireframe, without further suggestions for improvement.
RESULTS: A total of 25 interviews were completed. Participants were racially and 
ethnically diverse, generally representing our target end user population, and 
48% (n=12) of interviews were conducted in Spanish. Participants' suggestions to 
improve MBapp were categorized within the FRAME as adaptations that improved 
either content or context to optimize reach, retention, engagement, and fit for 
end users. Specifically, the following features were added to MBapp secondary to 
end user feedback: (1) audio narration; (2) "ask a clinician" nonurgent 
questions; (3) on-demand module summaries accessible upon module completion; and 
(4) choice to defer assessments and start the next module. Participants also 
provided insights into features of perinatal or mental health apps they found 
appealing or unappealing to understand preferences, challenges, and negotiables 
or nonnegotiables for MBapp.
CONCLUSIONS: Adapting MBapp to incorporate end users' perspectives optimized our 
digital PPD prevention intervention, ideally increasing its appeal to future 
users. Our team's next steps will confirm that MBapp is a feasible, acceptable 
intervention among English- and Spanish-speaking perinatal people at risk of 
PPD.

BACKGROUND: A strong and growing body of evidence has demonstrated the 
effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), either face-to-face, in 
person, or as self-help via the Internet, for depression. However, CBT is a 
complex intervention consisting of several putatively effective components, and 
how each component may or may not contribute to the overall effectiveness of CBT 
is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how the users of smartphone 
CBT use and benefit from various components of the program.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from a 9-week, single-blind, randomized 
controlled trial that has demonstrated the effectiveness of adjunctive use of 
smartphone CBT (Kokoro-App) over antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone among 
patients with drug-resistant major depressive disorder (total n=164, 
standardized mean difference in depression severity at week 9=0.40, J Med 
Internet Res). Kokoro-App consists of three cognitive behavioral skills of 
self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring, with 
corresponding worksheets to fill in. All activities of the participants learning 
each session of the program and completing each worksheet were uploaded onto 
Kokoro-Web, which each patient could use for self-check. We examined what use 
characteristics differentiated the more successful users of the CBT app from the 
less successful ones, split at the median of change in depression severity.
RESULTS: A total of 81 patients with major depression were allocated to the 
smartphone CBT. On average, they completed 7.0 (standard deviation [SD] 1.4) out 
of 8 sessions of the program; it took them 10.8 (SD 4.2) days to complete one 
session, during which they spent 62 min (SD 96) on the app. There were no 
statistically significant differences in the number of sessions completed, time 
spent for the program, or the number of completed self-monitoring worksheets 
between the beneficiaries and the nonbeneficiaries. However, the former 
completed more behavioral activation tasks, engaged in different types of 
activities, and also filled in more cognitive restructuring worksheets than the 
latter. Activities such as "test-drive a new car," "go to a coffee shop after 
lunch," or "call up an old friend" were found to be particularly rewarding. All 
cognitive restructuring strategies were found to significantly decrease the 
distress level, with "What would be your advice to a friend who has a similar 
problem?" found more helpful than some other strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The CBT program offered via smartphone and connected to the remote 
server is not only effective in alleviating depression but also opens a new 
avenue in gathering information of what and how each participant may utilize the 
program. The activities and strategies found useful in this analysis will 
provide valuable information in brush-ups of the program itself and of mobile 
health (mHealth) in general.

BACKGROUND: To address the need for disseminable, evidence-based depression 
treatment options for Latinx adults with limited English proficiency (LEP), our 
team developed ¡Aptívate!, a Spanish-language Behavioral Activation self-help 
mobile application. Primary aims of this study were to: 1) examine feasibility 
and uptake of ¡Aptívate! among depressed Latinx adults with LEP and 2) 
preliminarily examine ¡Aptívate! efficacy for depression treatment.
METHODS: Participants (N = 42) with elevated depressive symptoms were randomized 
2:1:1 to: 1) ¡Aptívate! (n = 22), 2) an active control Spanish-language app 
("iCouch CBT"; n = 9), or 3) Treatment As Usual (i.e., no app; n = 11). 
Feasibility was assessed via self-reported app utilization and app analytics 
data. Depressive symptoms were assessed weekly for eight weeks via self report.
RESULTS: All ¡Aptívate! participants used the app at least once, 81.8% of 
participants used the app ≥8 times, and 36.4% of participants used the app ≥56 
times. Weekly retention was strong: 72.7% and 50% of participants continued to 
use the app at one- and two-months post-enrollment, respectively. Generalized 
Estimating Equation models indicated a significant interaction between time and 
treatment, such that ¡Aptívate! participants reported significantly lower 
depressive symptoms over time than TAU. Depressive symptoms did not differ on 
average across time between the iCouch and TAU conditions, nor between iCouch 
and ¡Aptívate!.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations include small sample size, limited follow-up, and lack 
of analytics data for the active control condition.
CONCLUSIONS: With further research, ¡Aptívate! may offer a feasible, efficacious 
approach to extend the reach of evidence-based depression treatment for Latinx 
adults with LEP.

BACKGROUND: Hundreds of mental health apps are available to the general public. 
With increasing pressures on health care systems, they offer a potential way for 
people to support their mental health and well-being. However, although many are 
highly rated by users, few are evidence-based. Equally, our understanding of 
what makes apps engaging and valuable to users is limited.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze functionality and user opinions 
of mobile apps purporting to support cognitive behavioral therapy for depression 
and to explore key factors that have an impact on user experience and support 
engagement.
METHODS: We systematically identified apps described as being based on cognitive 
behavioral therapy for depression. We then conducted 2 studies. In the first, we 
analyzed the therapeutic functionality of apps. This corroborated existing work 
on apps' fidelity to cognitive behavioral therapy theory, but we also extended 
prior work by examining features designed to support user engagement. Engagement 
features found in cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression were compared 
with those found in a larger group of apps that support mental well-being in a 
more general sense. Our second study involved a more detailed examination of 
user experience, through a thematic analysis of publicly available user reviews 
of cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression.
RESULTS: We identified 31 apps that purport to be based on cognitive behavioral 
therapy for depression. Functionality analysis (study 1) showed that they 
offered an eclectic mix of features, including many not based on cognitive 
behavioral therapy practice. Cognitive behavioral therapy apps used less varied 
engagement features compared with 253 other mental well-being apps. The analysis 
of 1287 user reviews of cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression (study 
2) showed that apps are used in a wide range of contexts, both replacing and 
augmenting therapy, and allowing users to play an active role in supporting 
their mental health and well-being. Users, including health professionals, 
valued and used apps that incorporated both core cognitive behavioral therapy 
and non-cognitive behavioral therapy elements, but concerns were also expressed 
regarding the unsupervised use of apps. Positivity was seen as important to 
engagement, for example, in the context of automatic thoughts, users expressed a 
preference to capture not just negative but also positive ones. Privacy, 
security, and trust were crucial to the user experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression need to improve 
with respect to incorporating evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
elements. Equally, a positive user experience is dependent on other design 
factors, including consideration of varying contexts of use. App designers 
should be able to clearly identify the therapeutic basis of their apps, but they 
should also draw on evidence-based strategies to support a positive and engaging 
user experience. The most effective apps are likely to strike a balance between 
evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy strategies and evidence-based design 
strategies, including the possibility of eclectic therapeutic techniques.

Objective: This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a 
self-guided, mobile application for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia 
(CBT-I Coach) in a sample of college students. Participants: Data was collected 
from 55 students, who mostly identified as women (82%) and white (84%) and 
reported at least moderate insomnia symptoms based on the Insomnia Severity 
Index. Methods: Participants were randomized to either an intervention condition 
(i.e., 4 wk of CBT-I Coach) or a wait-list condition and completed self-report 
measures biweekly across the 8-week study period. Results: Nearly 70% of 
participants found the app moderately to extremely effective. The intervention 
group experienced a larger reduction in insomnia symptoms from baseline to 
post-treatment compared to the control group (g = 0.88). Conclusions: These 
findings provide preliminary evidence that utilizing a self-guided mobile 
intervention for insomnia among college students is feasible and components of 
the app were perceived to be moderately to highly effective.

OBJECTIVE: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of digitally delivered Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) have demonstrated reductions in insomnia 
severity, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal ideation. The 
present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-guided, digital CBT-I 
to improve sleep-specific outcomes.
METHOD: An RCT of Australian adults with insomnia and depressive symptoms 
(N = 1149) compared SHUTi, a digital CBT-I intervention, with HealthWatch, an 
attention-matched control internet program, at baseline, posttest (9 weeks) and 
at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups. Online sleep diaries were used to derive 
measures of sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep 
efficiency (SE), number of awakenings, sleep quality, and total sleep time 
(TST).
RESULTS: Participants in the SHUTi condition had greater improvements at 
posttest compared with control for: SOL, WASO, SE, number of awakenings, and 
sleep quality. These improvements were sustained at every follow-up (p < .02 for 
all outcomes except TST, in which statistically significant increases were 
observed only at 12- and 18-months).
CONCLUSIONS: Digitally delivered CBT-I produced lasting improvements in sleep 
outcomes among adults with insomnia and depressive symptoms. Findings provide 
further evidence of long-term improvements associated with a digital therapeutic 
for insomnia, compared to an attention-control condition.

Efficacy of the mHealth App Intellect in Improving Subclinical 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in University Students: Randomized Controlled 
Trial With a 4-Week Follow-Up.

BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the third most prevalent 
mental health disorder in Singapore, with a high degree of burden and large 
treatment gaps. Self-guided programs on mobile apps are accessible and 
affordable interventions, with the potential to address subclinical OCD before 
symptoms escalate.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the efficacy of a 
self-guided OCD program on the mobile health (mHealth) app Intellect in 
improving subclinical OCD and maladaptive perfectionism (MP) as a potential 
moderator of this predicted relationship.
METHODS: University students (N=225) were randomly assigned to an 8-day, 
self-guided app program on OCD (intervention group) or cooperation (active 
control). Self-reported measures were obtained at baseline, after the program, 
and at a 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome measure was OCD symptom severity 
(Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised [OCI-R]). Baseline MP was assessed as a 
potential moderator. Depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression Anxiety and 
Stress Scales-21) were controlled for during statistical analyses.
RESULTS: The final sample included 192 participants. The intervention group 
reported significantly lower OCI-R scores compared with the active control group 
after the intervention (partial eta-squared [ηp2]=0.031; P=.02) and at 4-week 
follow-up (ηp2=0.021; P=.044). A significant, weak positive correlation was 
found between MP and OCI-R levels at baseline (r=0.28; P<.001). MP was not found 
to moderate the relationship between condition and OCI-R scores at 
postintervention (P=.70) and at 4-week follow-up (P=.88).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the self-guided OCD program on 
the Intellect app is effective in reducing subclinical OCD among university 
students in Singapore. Future studies should include longer follow-up durations 
and study MP as a moderator in a broader spectrum of OCD symptom severity.

Race, Ethnicity, and Other Cultural Background Factors in Trials of 
Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in developing scalable interventions, 
including internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), to meet the 
increasing demand for mental health services. Given the growth in diversity 
worldwide, it is essential that the clinical trials of iCBT for depression 
include diverse samples or, at least, report information on the race, ethnicity, 
or other background indicators of their samples. Unfortunately, the field lacks 
data on how well diversity is currently reported and represented in the iCBT 
literature.
OBJECTIVE: Thus, the main objective of this systematic review was to examine the 
overall reporting of racial and ethnic identities in published clinical trials 
of iCBT for depression. We also aimed to review the representation of specific 
racial and ethnic minoritized groups and the inclusion of alternative background 
indicators such as migration status or country of residence.
METHODS: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials in 
which iCBT was compared to a waiting list, care-as-usual, active control, or 
another iCBT. The included papers also had to have a focus on acute treatment 
(eg, 4 weeks to 6 months) of depression, be delivered via the internet on a 
website or a smartphone app and use guided or unguided self-help. Studies were 
initially identified from the METAPSY database (n=59) and then extended to 
include papers up to 2022, with papers retrieved from Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, 
and Cochrane (n=3). Risk of bias assessment suggested that reported studies had 
at least some risk of bias due to use of self-report outcome measures.
RESULTS: A total of 62 iCBT randomized controlled trials representing 17,210 
participants are summarized in this study. Out of those 62 papers, only 17 (27%) 
of the trials reported race, and only 12 (19%) reported ethnicity. Reporting 
outside of the United States was very poor, with the United States accounting 
for 15 (88%) out of 17 of studies that reported race and 9 (75%) out of 12 for 
ethnicity. Out of 3,623 participants whose race was reported in the systematic 
review, the racial category reported the most was White (n=2716, 74.9%), 
followed by Asian (n=209, 5.8%) and Black (n=274, 7.6%). Furthermore, only 25 
(54%) out of the 46 papers conducted outside of the United States reported other 
background demographics.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to note that the underreporting observed in this 
study does not necessarily indicate an underrepresentation in the actual study 
population. However, these findings highlight the poor reporting of race and 
ethnicity in iCBT trials for depression found in the literature. This lack of 
diversity reporting may have significant implications for the scalability of 
these interventions.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV often struggle with mental health 
comorbidities that lower their antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. There is 
growing evidence that depression treatment may improve ART adherence and result 
in improved HIV outcomes. Given that mental health services are severely 
underequipped in low-resource settings, including in Uganda, new solutions to 
increase access to mental health care and close the treatment gap are urgently 
needed. This protocol paper presents the Suubi-Mhealth study, which proposed to 
develop a mobile health (mHealth) intervention for use among Ugandan youths 
(14-17 years) with comorbid HIV and depression, taking into account their unique 
contextual, cultural, and developmental needs.
OBJECTIVE: The proposed study is guided by the following objectives: (1) to 
develop and iteratively refine an intervention protocol for Suubi-Mhealth based 
on formative work to understand the needs of youths living with HIV; (2) to 
explore the feasibility and acceptability of Suubi-Mhealth on a small scale to 
inform subsequent refinement; (3) to test the preliminary impact of 
Suubi-Mhealth versus a waitlist control group on youths' outcomes, including 
depression and treatment adherence; and (4) to examine barriers and facilitators 
for integrating Suubi-Mhealth into health care settings.
METHODS: Youths will be eligible to participate in the study if they are (1) 
14-17 years of age, (2) HIV-positive and aware of their status, (3) receiving 
care and ART from one of the participating clinics, and (4) living within a 
family. The study will be conducted in 2 phases. In phase 1, we will conduct 
focus group discussions with youths and health care providers, for feedback on 
the proposed intervention content and methods, and explore the feasibility and 
acceptability of the intervention. In phase II, we will pilot-test the 
preliminary impact of the intervention on reducing depression and improving ART 
adherence. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 1-, 2-, and 6-months post 
intervention completion.
RESULTS: Participant recruitment for phase 1 is completed. Youths and health 
care providers participated in focus group discussions to share their feedback 
on the proposed Suubi-Mhealth intervention content, methods, design, and format. 
Transcription and translation of focus group discussions have been completed. 
The team is currently developing Suubi-Mhealth content based on participants' 
feedback.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will lay important groundwork for several initiatives at 
the intersection of digital therapeutics, HIV treatment, and mental health, 
especially among sub-Saharan African youths, as they transition through 
adolescence and into adult HIV care settings.

BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBTi) is an 
effective intervention for treating insomnia. The findings regarding its 
efficacy compared to face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia are 
inconclusive but suggest that dCBTi might be inferior. The lack of human support 
and low treatment adherence are believed to be barriers to dCBTi achieving its 
optimal efficacy. However, there has yet to be a direct comparative trial of 
dCBTi with different types of coaching support.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines whether adding chatbot-based and human coaching 
would improve the treatment efficacy of, and adherence to, dCBTi.
METHODS: Overall, 129 participants (n=98, 76% women; age: mean 34.09, SD 12.05 
y) whose scores on the Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] were greater than 9 were 
recruited. A randomized controlled comparative trial with 5 arms was conducted: 
dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching and therapist support (dCBTi-therapist), dCBTi 
with chatbot-based coaching and research assistant support, dCBTi with 
chatbot-based coaching only, dCBTi without any coaching, and digital sleep 
hygiene and self-monitoring control. Participants were blinded to the condition 
assignment and study hypotheses, and the outcomes were self-assessed using 
questionnaires administered on the web. The outcomes included measures of 
insomnia (the ISI and the Sleep Condition Indicator), mood disturbances, 
fatigue, daytime sleepiness, quality of life, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, 
and sleep-related safety behaviors administered at baseline, after treatment, 
and at 4-week follow-up. Treatment adherence was measured by the completion of 
video sessions and sleep diaries. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Significant condition-by-time interaction effects showed that dCBTi 
recipients, regardless of having any coaching, had greater improvements in 
insomnia measured by the Sleep Condition Indicator (P=.003; d=0.45) but not the 
ISI (P=.86; d=-0.28), depressive symptoms (P<.001; d=-0.62), anxiety (P=.01; 
d=-0.40), fatigue (P=.02; d=-0.35), dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (P<.001; 
d=-0.53), and safety behaviors related to sleep (P=.001; d=-0.50) than those who 
received digital sleep hygiene and self-monitoring control. The addition of 
chatbot-based coaching and human support did not improve treatment efficacy. 
However, adding human support promoted greater reductions in fatigue (P=.03; 
d=-0.33) and sleep-related safety behaviors (P=.05; d=-0.30) than dCBTi with 
chatbot-based coaching only at 4-week follow-up. dCBTi-therapist had the highest 
video and diary completion rates compared to other conditions (video: 16/25, 60% 
in dCBTi-therapist vs <3/21, <25% in dCBTi without any coaching), indicating 
greater treatment adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the efficacy of dCBTi in treating insomnia, 
reducing thoughts and behaviors that perpetuate insomnia, reducing mood 
disturbances and fatigue, and improving quality of life. Adding chatbot-based 
coaching and human support did not significantly improve the efficacy of dCBTi 
after treatment. However, adding human support had incremental benefits on 
reducing fatigue and behaviors that could perpetuate insomnia, and hence may 
improve long-term efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Although major depression is a frequent disorder in non-professional 
caregivers and there are effective psychological interventions to prevent it, 
caregivers have difficulty accessing them. Interventions for depression applied 
through an app could improve accessibility; yet, to date, adherence to such 
interventions has been low. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the 
efficacy of a cognitive behavioral depression prevention intervention 
administered through a smartphone app with and without telephone conference 
calls, (2) analyze the mediators of the change in the incidence of depression 
and depressive symptoms, and (3) assess adherence and satisfaction with the 
interventions.
METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Caregivers 
with elevated symptoms will be randomly assigned to a cognitive behavioral 
intervention administered by a smartphone app (CBIA) group, a CBIA plus 
telephone conference calls (TCCs) group (CBIA + TCC), or an attention control 
group. Each condition will consist of approximately 58 participants. Both 
interventions will be administered in five modules through a smartphone app and 
the CBIA + TCC group will receive additional TCCs in group format (four sessions 
of 30 min each). Trained blind assessors will conduct pre-treatment, 
post-treatment and follow-up assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence of the efficacy of a cognitive 
behavioral intervention to prevent depression in caregivers with elevated 
depressive symptoms administered through a smartphone app and the impact of 
feedback applied through conference calls to increase program adherence and 
efficacy. If the results were favorable, it would mean that we have developed a 
more effective, accessible, and clinically useful preventive depression 
intervention than the currently available ones for many present and future 
caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers play a pivotal role in maintaining an economically viable 
health care system, yet they are characterized by low levels of psychological 
well-being and consistently report unmet needs for psychological support. Mobile 
app-based (mobile health [mHealth]) interventions present a novel approach to 
both reducing stress and improving well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided mobile 
app-based psychological intervention for people providing care to family or 
friends with a physical or mental disability.
METHODS: In a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial, 183 caregivers 
recruited through the web were randomly allocated to either an intervention 
(n=73) or active control (n=110) condition. The intervention app contained 
treatment modules combining daily self-monitoring with third-wave 
(mindfulness-based) cognitive-behavioral therapies, whereas the active control 
app contained only self-monitoring features. Both programs were completed over a 
5-week period. It was hypothesized that intervention app exposure would be 
associated with decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, and increases in 
well-being, self-esteem, optimism, primary and secondary control, and social 
support. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-4 months 
postintervention. App quality was also assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 25% (18/73) of the intervention participants were lost to 
follow-up at 3 months, and 30.9% (34/110) of the participants from the wait-list 
control group dropped out before the postintervention survey. The intervention 
group experienced reductions in stress (b=-2.07; P=.04) and depressive symptoms 
(b=-1.36; P=.05) from baseline to postintervention. These changes were further 
enhanced from postintervention to follow-up, with the intervention group 
continuing to report lower levels of depression (b=-1.82; P=.03) and higher 
levels of emotional well-being (b=6.13; P<.001), optimism (b=0.78; P=.007), 
self-esteem (b=-0.84; P=.005), support from family (b=2.15; P=.001), support 
from significant others (b=2.66; P<.001), and subjective well-being (b=4.82; 
P<.001). On average, participants completed 2.5 (SD 1.05) out of 5 treatment 
modules. The overall quality of the app was also rated highly, with a mean score 
of 3.94 out of a maximum score of 5 (SD 0.58).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that mHealth psychological interventions 
are an effective treatment option for caregivers experiencing high levels of 
stress. Recommendations for improving mHealth interventions for caregivers 
include offering flexibility and customization in the treatment design.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychotherapy 
modalities used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Homework is an 
integral component of CBT, but homework compliance in CBT remains problematic in 
real-life practice. The popularization of the mobile phone with app capabilities 
(smartphone) presents a unique opportunity to enhance CBT homework compliance; 
however, there are no guidelines for designing mobile phone apps created for 
this purpose. Existing literature suggests 6 essential features of an optimal 
mobile app for maximizing CBT homework compliance: (1) therapy congruency, (2) 
fostering learning, (3) guiding therapy, (4) connection building, (5) emphasis 
on completion, and (6) population specificity. We expect that a well-designed 
mobile app incorporating these features should result in improved homework 
compliance and better outcomes for its users.

Adherence and Engagement With a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based 
Conversational Agent (Wysa for Chronic Pain) Among Adults With Chronic Pain: 
Survival Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Digital applications are commonly used to support mental health and 
well-being. However, successfully retaining and engaging users to complete 
digital interventions is challenging, and comorbidities such as chronic pain 
further reduce user engagement. Digital conversational agents (CAs) may improve 
user engagement by applying engagement principles that have been implemented 
within in-person care settings.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate user retention and engagement with an artificial 
intelligence-led digital mental health app (Wysa for Chronic Pain) that is 
customized for individuals managing mental health symptoms and coexisting 
chronic pain.
METHODS: In this ancillary survival analysis of a clinical trial, participants 
included 51 adults who presented to a tertiary care center for chronic 
musculoskeletal pain, who endorsed coexisting symptoms of depression or anxiety 
(Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System score of ≥55 for 
depression or anxiety), and initiated onboarding to an 8-week subscription of 
Wysa for Chronic Pain. The study outcomes were user retention, defined as 
revisiting the app each week and on the last day of engagement, and user 
engagement, defined by the number of sessions the user completed.
RESULTS: Users engaged in a cumulative mean of 33.3 sessions during the 8-week 
study period. The survival analysis depicted a median user retention period 
(i.e., time to complete disengagement) of 51 days, with the usage of a morning 
check-in feature having a significant relationship with a longer retention 
period (P=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that user retention and engagement with a 
CBT-based CA built for users with chronic pain is higher than standard industry 
metrics. These results have clear implications for addressing issues of 
suboptimal engagement of digital health interventions and improving access to 
care for chronic pain. Future work should use these findings to inform the 
design of evidence-based interventions for individuals with chronic pain and to 
enhance user retention and engagement of digital health interventions more 
broadly.

INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) is common, persistent, and 
stigmatized. There are insufficient trained professionals to deliver appropriate 
screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
AREAS COVERED: WB001 is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) based Agent-Guided 
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (AGCBT) program for the treatment of PPD, for which 
Breakthrough Device Designation was recently granted by the US Food and Drug 
Administration. WB001 combines therapeutic alliance, human-centered design, 
machine learning techniques, and established principles from CBT and 
interpersonal therapy (IPT). We introduce AGCBT as a new model of service 
delivery, whilst describing Woebot, the agent technology that enables guidance 
through the replication of some elements of human relationships. The profile 
describes the device's design principles, enabling technology, risk handling, 
and efficacy data in PPD.
EXPERT OPINION: WB001 is a dynamic and personalized tool with which patients may 
establish a therapeutic bond. Woebot is designed to augment (rather than 
replace) human healthcare providers, unlocking the therapeutic potency 
associated with guidance, whilst retaining the scalability and agency that 
characterizes self-help approaches. WB001 has the potential to improve both the 
quality and the scalability of care through providing support to patients on 
waiting lists, in between clinical encounters, and enabling automation of 
measurement-based-care.

BACKGROUND: Digitally delivered psychological therapies are increasingly used 
for older adults, but their effectiveness for depression and anxiety remains 
unclear.
METHODS: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) on digitally delivered 
psychological therapies were searched in databases including Pubmed, Web of 
Science, Cochrane Library, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase. The search 
time was from the establishment of the database to September 2024. The quality 
of the included RCTs was evaluated by two trained researchers using the Cochrane 
Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Data extraction and analysis were conducted 
independently using Network Meta-analysis (NMA) with Stata 18.0 statistical 
software.
RESULTS: A total of 28 studies, encompassing six different digitally delivered 
psychological therapies and involving 4000 older adults, were included in this 
review. The NMA demonstrated that digitally delivered psychological therapies 
are effective in alleviating symptoms of both depression and anxiety symptoms in 
older adults. Specifically, digital Reminiscence therapy (RT) may be more 
effective in alleviating depressive symptoms (SMD: -7.60, 95 % CI: -13.92 to 
-1.28) than other interventions. For anxiety symptoms, digital Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) may be more effective (SMD: -3.11, 95 % CI: -4.25 to 
-1.96).
CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence shows that digital RT may be more effective 
for reducing depression symptoms, while digital CBT is more effective for 
anxiety symptoms. However, due to the diversity of psychological therapies and 
the small number of studies included in each therapy, the coverage of this study 
may not be comprehensive. Future research should prioritize large-sample, 
multi-center, and high-quality RCTs to further validate these results.

BACKGROUND: According to previous research, dysfunctional attitudes and/or 
scoring extreme on the end-point anchors of questionnaires of dysfunctional 
thinking predict depressive relapse/recurrence. Evidence that these two methods 
represent a risk for depressive relapse/recurrence is however mixed, due to 
differential or poorly defined concepts. The current study aimed to test the two 
methods.
METHODS: Remitted recurrently depressed patients with low residual depressive 
symptoms (N = 264) were recruited as part of a randomized controlled trial of 
the effectiveness of mobile Cognitive Therapy for recurrent depression versus 
treatment as usual. In the current secondary analysis, Cox regression models 
were conducted to test dysfunctional attitudes and extreme responding variables 
(assessed on the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale [DAS]) as predictors of 
depressive relapse/recurrence within two years after randomization.
RESULTS: Data from 255 participants were analyzed. Results showed that DAS total 
scores at baseline significantly predicted depressive relapse/recurrence (Hazard 
Ratio [HR] = 1.01, p = .042). An index that reflects endorsement of habitual 
relative to functional responses was a significant predictor of depressive 
relapse/recurrence (HR = 2.11, p = .029).
LIMITATIONS: The current study employed a single measure to identify extreme 
responses and dysfunctional attitudes. Secondly, various statistical analyses 
were performed without correcting for multiple testing, which in turn increased 
the likelihood to finding significant results.
CONCLUSIONS: Current study confirmed both methods: People who scored higher on 
the DAS or had relatively more habitual than functional responses on the extreme 
positive ends of the DAS had a decreased time to depressive relapse/recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions provide significant strategies for 
improving access to health services, offering a potential solution to reduce the 
mental health treatment gap. Economic evaluation of this intervention is needed 
to help inform local mental health policy and program development.
OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an economic evaluation conducted 
alongside 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of a psychological intervention delivered through a 
technological platform (CONEMO) to treat depressive symptoms in people with 
diabetes, hypertension, or both.
METHODS: The economic evaluation uses a within-trial analysis to evaluate the 
incremental costs and health outcomes of CONEMO plus enhanced usual care in 
comparison with enhanced usual care from public health care system and societal 
perspectives. Participants are patients of the public health care services for 
hypertension, diabetes, or both conditions in São Paulo, Brazil (n=880) and 
Lima, Peru (n=432). Clinical effectiveness will be measured by reduction in 
depressive symptoms and gains in health-related quality of life. We will conduct 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, providing estimates of the cost 
per at least 50% reduction in 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores, and 
cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. The measurement of clinical 
effectiveness and resource use will take place over baseline, 3-month follow-up, 
and 6-month follow-up in the intervention and control groups. We will use a 
mixed costing methodology (ie, a combination of top-down and bottom-up 
approaches) considering 4 cost categories: intervention (CONEMO related) costs, 
health care costs, patient and family costs, and productivity costs. We will 
collect unit costs from the RCTs and national administrative databases. The 
multinational economic evaluations will be fully split analyses with a 
multicountry costing approach. We will calculate incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios and present 95% CIs from nonparametric bootstrapping (1000 replicates). 
We will perform deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, 
we will present cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to compare a range of 
possible cost-effectiveness thresholds.
RESULTS: The economic evaluation project had its project charter in June 2018 
and is expected to be completed in September 2021. The final results will be 
available in the second half of 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: We expect to assess whether CONEMO plus enhanced usual care is a 
cost-effective strategy to improve depressive symptoms in this population 
compared with enhanced usual care. This study will contribute to the evidence

Workforce shortages represent a major bottleneck to delivering depression care, 
particularly in lower resource settings. This pilot study aimed to assess the 
acceptability and feasibility of a digital training program on developing 
knowledge and skills in the delivery of a brief behavioral activation 
intervention for depression among non-specialist providers (NSPs) in Gujarat, 
India. Participating NSPs, such as community health workers and other frontline 
providers without specialized training in mental health care, were provided 
access to a digital program covering the core skills and content necessary to 
deliver the Healthy Activity Program, an evidence-based behavioral activation 
intervention for depression. NSPs completed knowledge assessments before and 
after the digital training, followed by focus group discussions to gather their 
feedback about the program content and delivery format. Of 43 NSPs enrolled in 
this study, 67% (n = 29) were community health workers called Accredited Social 
Health Activists and 33% (n = 14) were frontline mid-level health providers 
called Community Health Officers. Most participants (n = 39; 91%) completed the 
full course. Knowledge assessment scores showed improvement from pre-training 
(mean = 29.96; 95% CI: 27.12-32.81) to post-training (mean = 34.62; 95% CI: 
31.05-38.19; p = 0.0448). Focus group discussions revealed that participants 
appreciated the digital mode of training despite facing technical challenges 
while completing the course. This study further supports the feasibility and 
acceptability of digital approaches for training frontline providers to deliver 
brief psychological interventions for depression. With adequate resources and 
proper execution, digital training holds potential to serve as a key tool to 
build capacity of NSPs and expand the mental health workforce in India.

BACKGROUND: Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a 
pervasive negative mood, research indicates that the mood of depressed patients 
is rarely entirely stagnant. It is often dynamic, distinguished by highs and 
lows, and it is highly responsive to external and internal regulatory processes. 
Mood dynamics can be defined as a combination of mood variability (the magnitude 
of the mood changes) and emotional inertia (the speed of mood shifts). The 
purpose of this study is to explore various distinctive profiles in real-time 
monitored mood dynamics among MDD patients in routine mental healthcare.
METHODS: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data were collected as part of 
the cross-European E-COMPARED trial, in which approximately half of the patients 
were randomly assigned to receive the blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
(bCBT). In this study a subsample of the bCBT group was included (n = 287). As 
part of bCBT, patients were prompted to rate their current mood (on a 1-10 
scale) using a smartphone-based EMA application. During the first week of 
treatment, the patients were prompted to rate their mood on three separate 
occasions during the day. Latent profile analyses were subsequently applied to 
identify distinct profiles based on average mood, mood variability, and 
emotional inertia across the monitoring period.
RESULTS: Overall, four profiles were identified, which we labeled as: (1) "very 
negative and least variable mood" (n = 14) (2) "negative and moderate variable 
mood" (n = 204), (3) "positive and moderate variable mood" (n = 41), and (4) 
"negative and highest variable mood" (n = 28). The degree of emotional inertia 
was virtually identical across the profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: The real-time monitoring conducted in the present study provides 
some preliminary indications of different patterns of both average mood and mood 
variability among MDD patients in treatment in mental health settings. Such 
varying patterns were not found for emotional inertia.

INTRODUCTION: Postpartum Depression (PPD) is common, persistent, and 
stigmatized. There are insufficient trained professionals to deliver appropriate 
screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
AREAS COVERED: WB001 is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) based Agent-Guided 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (AGCBT) program for the treatment of PPD, for which 
Breakthrough Device Designation was recently granted by the US Food and Drug 
Administration. WB001 combines therapeutic alliance, human-centered design, 
machine learning techniques, and established principles from CBT and 
interpersonal therapy (IPT). We introduce AGCBT as a new model of service 
delivery, whilst describing Woebot, the agent technology that enables guidance 
through the replication of some elements of human relationships. The profile 
describes the device's design principles, enabling technology, risk handling, 
and efficacy data in PPD.
EXPERT OPINION: WB001 is a dynamic and personalized tool with which patients may 
establish a therapeutic bond. Woebot is designed to augment (rather than 
replace) human healthcare providers, unlocking the therapeutic potency 
associated with guidance, whilst retaining the scalability and agency that 
characterizes self-help approaches. WB001 has the potential to improve both the 
quality and the scalability of care through providing support to patients on 
waiting lists, in between clinical encounters, and enabling automation of 
measurement-based care.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe hemoglobinopathy characterized by acute 
and chronic pain. Sufferers of the disease, most of whom are underrepresented 
minorities, are at increased risk for mental health disorders. The purpose of 
this study is to test the acceptability and implementation of a computerized 
cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) intervention, Beating the Blues, to improve 
depression, anxiety, and pain in patients with SCD. Adults with SCD and 
significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score ≥ 
10) or anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7] score ≥ 10) were 
eligible to participate and be randomized to either receive eight sessions of 
cCBT with care coach support or treatment as usual. Participants reported daily 
pain and mood symptoms using a mobile diary app. Depression, anxiety, and pain 
symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Thirty patients were enrolled: 18 
to cCBT, and 12 to control. The cCBT intervention was feasible to implement in 
clinical settings and acceptable to participants. Patients in the cCBT arm 
reported a marginally greater decrease in depression at 6 months (-3.82, SE = 
1.30) than those in the control group (-0.50, SE = 1.60; p = .06). There were no 
significant effects of treatment on anxiety; however, cCBT was associated with 
improved daily pain reported via a mobile diary app (p = .014). cCBT, delivered 
via mobile device, is a feasible strategy to provide mental health care to 
adults living with SCD. cCBT was acceptable to the target population; was able 
to be implemented in real-world, nonideal conditions; and has the potential to 
improve patient-reported outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Subthreshold depression is a risk factor for major depression and is 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in older adults. 
There is emerging evidence that digital interventions, including self-help 
interventions, may reduce depressive symptoms. We aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a mobile messaging intervention at reducing subthreshold 
depressive symptoms among older adults in Brazil.
METHODS: PRODIGITAL was a single blind, two-arm, individually randomised 
controlled trial conducted in 46 primary care clinics in the city of Guarulhos, 
Brazil. Individuals aged 60+ years were contacted by phone following a randomly 
ordered list for a screening assessment. Those who presented with anhedonia 
and/or depressed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2≥1), and who 
subsequently scored between 5 and 9 on the PHQ-9 were invited to participate. 
The intervention arm received the 'Viva Vida' digital self-help intervention 
consisting of automated multi-media messages sent via WhatsApp. Forty-eight 
audio and visual messages based on psychoeducation and behavioural activation 
were automatically delivered over six weeks. The control arm received a single 
message containing information about depression. The primary outcome was the 
difference in mean PHQ-9 scores between treatment arms at the three-month 
follow-up. All primary analyses were performed according to allocated arm with 
imputed data. The trial is registered with ReBEC, RBR-6c7ghfd.
FINDINGS: Participants were recruited between 8 September 2021 and 19 August 
2022. Of the 454 participants enrolled, 223 were randomised to the intervention 
arm, 231 to the control arm. Participants' mean age was 65.3 years (SD 5.0) and 
64.0% (n = 292) were female. A total of 385 (84.8%) completed the three-month 
follow-up assessment; no difference in mean PHQ-9 scores between the treatment 
arms was observed (adjusted difference: -0.61; 95% CI: -1.75, 0.53; p = 0.29).
INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that the Viva Vida digital self-help 
intervention did not help to improve subthreshold depressive symptoms amongst 
older adults. Further research is needed to understand why this self-help 
intervention was not effective in this population, and to explore how it might 
be adapted to achieve this goal.

OBJECTIVE: Interventions in post-disaster environments may be accelerated by 
identifying protective behavioral factors adding incremental value to models of 
psychopathology using longitudinal methods. One protective behavior applicable 
to post-disaster contexts is behavioral activation (BA). BA is defined here as a 
behavioral pattern involving presence of valued activity engagement. While 
relevant post-disaster, the incremental value of BA behaviors in predicting 
longitudinal post-disaster outcomes is not well understood. We hypothesized that 
higher baseline engagement in behaviors consistent with a BA framework would 
predict decreased posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, 
depression symptom severity, and sleep disturbance approximately 3, 6, and 12 
months after hurricane survivors completed baseline measures.
METHODS: The current study is a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled 
trial of a disaster mental health digital intervention. Participants completed 
surveys at baseline and approximately 3, 6, and 12 months post-enrollment. 
Correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were calculated following data 
screening to predict PTSD symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and 
sleep disturbances.
RESULTS: Controlling for alcohol use, prior trauma, displacement, and 
intervention condition, higher baseline BA consistently predicted less PTSD 
symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and sleep disturbances.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that post-disaster interventions should consider 
addressing BA. The study provides evidence that BA is potentially an important 
protective factor longitudinally predicting sleep disturbances and 
psychopathology after natural disasters.

PURPOSE: Perinatal depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and 
childbirth, and it is associated with adverse consequences. The United States 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that pregnant and postpartum 
(i.e., perinatal) individuals at risk for depression be referred for therapy or 
counseling interventions; however, it is unclear to what extent this 
recommendation has been implemented.
METHODS: Pregnant individuals were recruited via advertisements on a pregnancy 
app and a separate study on sleep. Respondents completed the initial screening 
questions to determine their risk for perinatal depression, defined as 
self-reported history of depression; recent stressors; history of emotional, 
sexual, or physical abuse; mild depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; single; 
diabetes diagnosis; or unwanted pregnancy. Eligible respondents reported their 
providers' recommendations for preventing depression, and their utilization of 
interventions to prevent depression (n = 303).
RESULTS: Fewer than 15% of participants reported that a provider referred them 
for therapy or counseling to prevent depression; recommendations included 
cognitive behavioral therapy (4%), interpersonal psychotherapy (2.3%), 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (4.3%), or other/unknown (6.6%). 
Approximately 12% reported that a provider recommended medication to prevent 
depression. Provider referral rates varied by risk factor, but not by patient 
demographics. Nearly 20% of participants reported using therapy or counseling to 
prevent depression, and nearly 13% reported using medication to prevent 
depression.
CONCLUSIONS: We explore potential factors affecting the uptake of the USPSTF 
recommendation and underscore the importance of preventing perinatal depression.

BACKGROUND: Based on evidence that mental health is more than an absence of 
mental disorders, there have been calls to find ways to promote flourishing at a 
population level, especially in young people, which requires effective and 
scalable interventions. Despite their potential for scalability, few mental 
wellbeing apps have been rigorously tested in high-powered trials, derived from 
models of healthy emotional functioning, or tailored to individual profiles. We 
aimed to test a personalised emotional competence self-help app versus a 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help app versus a self-monitoring app 
to promote mental wellbeing in healthy young people.
METHODS: This international, multicentre, parallel, open-label, randomised 
controlled trial within a cohort multiple randomised trial (including a parallel 
trial of depression prevention) was done at four university trial sites in four 
countries (the UK, Germany, Spain, and Belgium). Participants were recruited 
from schools and universities and via social media from the four respective 
countries. Eligible participants were aged 16-22 years with well adjusted 
emotional competence profiles and no current or past diagnosis of major 
depression. Participants were randomised (1:1:1) to usual practice plus either 
the emotional competence app, the CBT app or the self-monitoring app, by an 
independent computerised system, minimised by country, age, and self-reported 
gender, and followed up for 12 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome 
was mental wellbeing (indexed by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale 
[WEMWBS]) at 3-month follow-up, analysed in participants who completed the 
3-month follow-up assessment. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. 
The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04148508, and is closed.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2020, and Aug 3, 2021, 2532 participants were 
enrolled, and 847 were randomly assigned to the emotional competence app, 841 to 
the CBT app, and 844 to the self-monitoring app. Mean age was 19·2 years (SD 
1·8). Of 2532 participants self-reporting gender, 1896 (74·9%) were female, 613 
(24·2%) were male, 16 (0·6%) were neither, and seven (0·3%) were both. 425 
participants in the emotional competence app group, 443 in the CT app group, and 
447 in the self-monitoring app group completed the follow-up assessment at 3 
months. There was no difference in mental wellbeing between the groups at 3 
months (global p=0·47). The emotional competence app did not differ from the CBT 
app (mean difference in WEMWBS -0·21 [95% CI -1·08 to 0·66]) or the 
self-monitoring app (0·32 [-0·54 to 1·19]) and the CBT app did not differ from 
the self-monitoring app (0·53 [-0·33 to 1·39]). 14 of 1315 participants were 
admitted to or treated in hospital (or both) for mental health-related reasons, 
which were considered unrelated to the interventions (five participants in the 
emotional competence app group, eight in the CBT app group, and one in the 
self-monitoring app group). No deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: The emotional competence app and the CBT app provided limited 
benefit in promoting mental wellbeing in healthy young people. This finding 
might reflect the low intensity of these interventions and the difficulty 
improving mental wellbeing via universal digital interventions implemented in 
low-risk populations.

BACKGROUND: Depression often emerges for the first time during adolescence. 
There is accumulating evidence that universal depression prevention programs may 
have the capacity to reduce the impact of depression when delivered in the 
school environment.
OBJECTIVE: This trial investigated the effectiveness of SPARX-R, a gamified 
online cognitive behavior therapy intervention for the prevention of depression 
relative to an attention-matched control intervention delivered to students 
prior to facing a significant stressor-final secondary school exams. It was 
hypothesized that delivering a prevention intervention in advance of a stressor 
would reduce depressive symptoms relative to the control group.
METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 10 government 
schools in Sydney, Australia. Participants were 540 final year secondary 
students (mean 16.7 [SD 0.51] years), and clusters at the school level were 
randomly allocated to SPARX-R or the control intervention. Interventions were 
delivered weekly in 7 modules, each taking approximately 20 to 30 minutes to 
complete. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression as measured by the 
Major Depression Inventory. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, participants in the SPARX-R condition (n=242) 
showed significantly reduced depression symptoms relative to the control (n=298) 
at post-intervention (Cohen d=0.29) and 6 months post-baseline (d=0.21) but not 
at 18 months post-baseline (d=0.33).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial to demonstrate a preventive effect on 
depressive symptoms prior to a significant and universal stressor in 
adolescents. It demonstrates that an online intervention delivered in advance of 
a stressful experience can reduce the impact of such an event on the potential 
development or exacerbation of depression.

Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is an under-utilized Level A evidence-based 
treatment for migraine prevention. We studied the feasibility and acceptability 
of smartphone application (app)-based PMR for migraine in a neurology setting, 
explored whether app-based PMR might reduce headache (HA) days, and examined 
potential predictors of app and/or PMR use. In this single-arm pilot study, 
adults with ICHD3 migraine, 4+ HA days/month, a smartphone, and no prior 
behavioral migraine therapy in the past year were asked to complete a daily HA 
diary and do PMR for 20 min/day for 90 days. Outcomes were: adherence to PMR 
(no. and duration of audio plays) and frequency of diary use. Predictors in the 
models were baseline demographics, HA-specific variables, baseline PROMIS 
(patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) depression and 
anxiety scores, presence of overlapping pain conditions studied and app 
satisfaction scores at time of enrollment. Fifty-one patients enrolled (94% 
female). Mean age was 39 ± 13 years. The majority (63%) had severe migraine 
disability at baseline (MIDAS). PMR was played 22 ± 21 days on average. 
Mean/session duration was 11 ± 7 min. About half (47%) of uses were 1+ time/week 
and 35% of uses were 2+ times/week. There was a decline in use/week. On average, 
high users (PMR 2+ days/week in the first month) had 4 fewer days of reported 
HAs in month 2 vs. month 1, whereas low PMR users (PMR < 2 days/week in the 
first month) had only 2 fewer HA days in month 2. PROMIS depression score was 
negatively associated with the log odds of using the diary at least once (vs. no 
activity) in a week (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.55, 0.85]) and of doing the PMR at 
least once in a week (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.68, 0.91]). PROMIS anxiety was 
positively associated with using the diary at least once every week (OR = 1.33, 
95% CI = [1.09, 1.73]) and with doing the PMR at least once every week 
(OR = 1.14 [95% CI = [1.02, 1.31]). In conclusion, about half of participants 
used smartphone-based PMR intervention based upon a brief, initial introduction 
to the app. App use was associated with reduction in HA days. Higher depression 
scores were negatively associated with diary and PMR use, whereas higher anxiety 
scores were positively associated.

Obesity has become a major public health issue which relate to numerous physical 
problems and highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Recently, some studies 
of technology-based interventions for weight reduction emerged to overcome the 
barriers from time, cost and distance. Mood component and eating behavior 
related to obesity are less discussed so far with technology-based intervention 
though. This pilot study was aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth 
assisted intervention on weight reduction, mood status, and eating behavior 
change under a smartphone application (app) with novel 3D food picture 
recognition and incorporated with cognitive behavioral training programs. Adult 
aged 30-60 years old with overweight were recruited and randomly assigned to 
control-first group and intervention-first group. In period 1, control-first 
group had regular life and intervention-first group underwent app intervention; 
in period 2, two groups went crossover. Body composition and 
psychological/behavioral questionnaires were collected at baseline, end of 
period 1, and end of period 2. Nonparametric statistics was performed for data 
analyzing. A total of 20 participants were enrolled. In control-first group, 
there were statistically significant reduction in body weight (- 0.55 kg, 
p = 0.02) and change of body weight percentage (- 0.6%, p = 0.02) after App use. 
In intervention-first group, the fat percentage decreased by 0.4% after App use 
in period 1, and increased by 0.05% in period 2. The integrated crossover data 
revealed that subjects of App group had significant improvements in mindful 
eating behavior. This pilot study showed the effectiveness in using CogniNU app 
for weight control and eating behavior. The difference of short-term and 
long-term effectiveness of technology-based weight control intervention deserves 
more investigation in the future.Clinical Trial Registration: ISRCTN16082909.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions can be effective in the treatment of 
depression. However, internet-based interventions for older adults with 
depression are scarce, and little is known about their feasibility and 
effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To present the design of 2 studies aiming to assess the feasibility 
of internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment for older adults with 
depression. We will assess the feasibility of an online, guided version of the 
Moodbuster platform among depressed older adults from the general population as 
well as the feasibility of a blended format (combining integrated face-to-face 
sessions and internet-based modules) in a specialized mental health care 
outpatient clinic.
METHODS: A single-group, pretest-posttest design will be applied in both 
settings. The primary outcome of the studies will be feasibility in terms of (1) 
acceptance and satisfaction (measured with the Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire-8), (2) usability (measured with the System Usability Scale), and 
(3) engagement (measured with the Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies 
Scale). Secondary outcomes include (1) the severity of depressive symptoms 
(measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale), (2) 
participant and therapist experience with the digital technology (measured with 
qualitative interviews), (3) the working alliance between patients and 
practitioners (from both perspectives; measured with the Working Alliance 
Inventory-Short Revised questionnaire), (4) the technical alliance between 
patients and the platform (measured with the Working Alliance Inventory for 
Online Interventions-Short Form questionnaire), and (5) uptake, in terms of 
attempted and completed modules. A total of 30 older adults with mild to 
moderate depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15 score between 5 and 
11) will be recruited from the general population. A total of 15 older adults 
with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15 score 
between 8 and 15) will be recruited from a specialized mental health care 
outpatient clinic. A mixed methods approach combining quantitative and 
qualitative analyses will be adopted. Both the primary and secondary outcomes 
will be further explored with individual semistructured interviews and 
synthesized descriptively. Descriptive statistics (reported as means and SDs) 
will be used to examine the primary and secondary outcome measures. Within-group 
depression severity will be analyzed using a 2-tailed, paired-sample t test to 
investigate differences between time points. The interviews will be recorded and 
analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The studies were funded in October 2019. Recruitment started in 
September 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these pilot studies will show whether this platform 
is feasible for use by the older adult population in a blended, guided format in 
the 2 settings and will represent the first exploration of the size of the 
effect of Moodbuster in terms of decreased depressive symptoms.

BACKGROUND: This paper reports the results of a pilot randomized controlled 
trial comparing the delivery modality (mobile phone/tablet or fixed computer) of 
a cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for the treatment of depression. 
The aim was to establish whether a previously validated computerized program 
(The Sadness Program) remained efficacious when delivered via a mobile 
application.
METHOD: 35 participants were recruited with Major Depression (80% female) and 
randomly allocated to access the program using a mobile app (on either a mobile 
phone or iPad) or a computer. Participants completed 6 lessons, weekly homework 
assignments, and received weekly email contact from a clinical psychologist or 
psychiatrist until completion of lesson 2. After lesson 2 email contact was only 
provided in response to participant request, or in response to a deterioration 
in psychological distress scores. The primary outcome measure was the Patient 
Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Of the 35 participants recruited, 68.6% 
completed 6 lessons and 65.7% completed the 3-months follow up. Attrition was 
handled using mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA.
RESULTS: Both the Mobile and Computer Groups were associated with statistically 
significantly benefits in the PHQ-9 at post-test. At 3 months follow up, the 
reduction seen for both groups remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence to indicate that delivering a CBT 
program using a mobile application, can result in clinically significant 
improvements in outcomes for patients with depression.

Novel Smartphone App and Supportive Accountability for the Treatment of 
Childhood Disruptive Behavior Problems: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled 
Trial.

BACKGROUND: Although evidence-based treatments have been developed for childhood 
behavior problems, many families encounter barriers to treatment access and 
completion (eg, local availability of services, transportation, cost, and 
perceived stigma). Smartphone apps offer a cost-efficient method to deliver 
content to families.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UseIt! 
mobile health system as both stand-alone and coach-assisted interventions via a 
randomized controlled trial. The UseIt! System is designed to reduce disruptive 
behaviors in young children.
METHODS: A nationwide sample of parents of children aged 5 years to 8 years with 
disruptive behaviors (N=324 dyads) are randomly assigned to the stand-alone app 
(UseIt!; n=108), the coach-assisted app (UseIt! plus supportive accountability; 
n=108), or the control app (mindfulness app; n=108). The UseIt! App provides 
parents with tools and troubleshooting to address disruptive behaviors, along 
with a behavior diary to track behaviors and strategies over time. The 
coach-assisted condition includes a bachelor's level paraprofessional who 
provides weekly phone calls to promote engagement with the app. The control 
condition is composed of a mindfulness app. The web-based, self-assessed outcome 
measures (post treatment and 6-month follow-up) include measures of app usage, 
parenting knowledge (eg, knowledge of parent management training and cognitive 
behavioral therapy skills), and strategies (use of evidence-based parenting 
strategies), symptom reduction (eg, behavior problems), and parent mental health 
(eg, anxiety, stress, and depression). We hypothesize that both intervention 
conditions will show greater parent knowledge and use of skills along with 
greater symptom reduction relative to the control condition. Further, we 
hypothesize that those assigned to the coach assisted condition will report 
greater knowledge, skill use, and symptom reduction than the stand-alone app. We 
will use intent-to-treat analyses to regress outcomes on study conditions to 
evaluate for differences across conditions.
RESULTS: Recruitment of study participants began in December of 2022 and is 
ongoing. We have recruited over half of our intended sample of 324 parent-child 
dyads (n=214) as of December 2024. These dyads have been randomly allocated to 
each of the intervention conditions, with 71 assigned to the coach-assisted 
condition, 72 assigned to the stand-alone app, and 71 assigned to the control 
app condition. Data collection is projected to be completed by late 2026.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study aims to address a gap in the literature regarding 
the feasibility, effectiveness, and utility of a smartphone app that includes a 
coach-assisted arm. Digital therapeutics have the potential to enhance the reach 
and scalability of skills-based psychosocial interventions. Findings from this 
study will advance scientific knowledge and have implications for clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: The Feeling Good App is an automated stand-alone digital mobile 
mental health tool currently undergoing beta testing with the goal of providing 
evidence-informed self-help lessons and exercises to help individuals reduce 
depressive symptoms without guidance from a mental health provider. Users work 
through intensive basic training (IBT) and ongoing training models that provide 
education regarding cognitive behavioral therapy principles from a smartphone.
OBJECTIVE: The key objective of this study was to perform a nonsponsored 
third-party academic assessment of an industry-generated data set; this data set 
focused on the safety, feasibility, and accessibility of a commercial automated 
digital mobile mental health app that was developed to reduce feelings 
associated with depression.
METHODS: The Feeling Good App development team created a waitlist cohort 
crossover design and measured symptoms of depression and anxiety using the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and an 
app-specific measure of negative feelings called the 7 Dimension Emotion Slider 
(7-DES). The waitlist cohort crossover design divided the participants into 2 
groups, where 48.6% (141/290) of the participants were given immediate access to 
the apps, while 51.4% (149/290) were placed on a 2-week waitlist before being 
given access to the app. Data collected by the Feeling Good App development team 
were deidentified and provided to the authors of this paper for analysis through 
a nonsponsored university data use agreement. All quantitative data were 
analyzed using SPSS Statistics (version 28.0; IBM Corp). Descriptive statistics 
were calculated for demographic variables. Feasibility and acceptability were 
descriptively assessed. All participants included in the quantitative data were 
given access to the Feeling Good App; this study did not include a control 
group.
RESULTS: In terms of safety, there was no statistically significant change in 
suicidality from preintervention to postintervention time points (t288=0.0; 
P>.99), and there was a statistically significant decrease in hopelessness from 
preintervention to postintervention time points (F289=30.16; P<.01). In terms of 
acceptability, 72.2% (166/230) of the users who started the initial 2-day IBT 
went on to complete it, while 34.8% (80/230) of the users who started IBT 
completed the entirety of the apps' 4-week protocol (150/230, 65.22% dropout 
rate over 4 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first reported proof-of-concept evaluation of the 
Feeling Good App in terms of safety, feasibility, and statistical trends within 
the data set. It demonstrates a feasible and novel approach to industry and 
academic collaboration in the process of developing a digital mental health 
technology translated from an existing evidence-informed treatment. The results 
support the prototype app as safe for a select nonclinical population. The app 
had acceptable levels of engagement and dropouts throughout the intervention. 
Those who stay engaged showed reductions in symptom severity of depression 
warranting further investigation of the app's efficacy.

BACKGROUND: As an evidence-based psychotherapy for treating insomnia, cognitive 
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which helps people with sleep problems 
to change their unhelpful sleep-related beliefs and habits, has been 
well-established in older adults. Recently, the utilization of mobile CBT-I apps 
has been getting attention from mental health professionals and researchers; 
however, whether mobile CBT-I apps are usable among older users has yet to be 
determined.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore the relationships between 
subjective sleep quality and subjective memory complaints and depressive 
symptoms; to explore the relationship between perceived difficulty in mobile app 
use and usability of the mobile phone-based self-help CBT-I app, named MIND 
MORE, in urban community-dwelling Korean older adults; to compare changes in 
subjective sleep quality from pre-intervention to post-intervention, during 
which they used the mobile app over a 1-week intervention period; and evaluate 
adherence to the app.
METHODS: During the 2-hour training program delivered on 1 day titled 
"Overcoming insomnia without medication: How to use the 'MIND MORE' mobile app 
for systematic self-management of insomnia" (pre-intervention), 41 attendants 
were asked to gain hands-on experience with the app facilitated by therapists 
and volunteer workers. They were then asked to complete questionnaires on 
sociodemographic characteristics, subjective evaluation of mental health status 
(ie, depression, memory loss and impairment, and sleep problems), and app 
usability. For the 1-week home-based self-help CBT-I using the app 
(post-intervention), 9 of the 41 program attendants, who had already signed up 
for the pre-intervention, were guided to complete the given questionnaires on 
subjective evaluation of sleep quality after the 1-week intervention, 
specifically 8 days after the training program ended.
RESULTS: Due to missing data, 40 of 41 attendants were included in the data 
analysis. The main findings of this study were as follows. First, poor 
subjective sleep quality was associated with higher ratings of depressive 
symptoms (40/40; ρ=.60, P<.001) and memory complaints (40/40; ρ=.46, P=.003) at 
baseline. Second, significant improvements in subjective sleep quality from 
pre-intervention to post-intervention were observed in the older adults who used 
the MIND MORE app only for the 1-week intervention period (9/9; t8=3.74, 
P=.006). Third, apart from the program attendants who did not have a smartphone 
(2/40) or withdrew from their MIND MORE membership (3/40), those who attended 
the 1-day sleep education program adhered to the app from at least 2 weeks 
(13/35, 37%) to 8 weeks (2/35, 6%) without any further contact.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence that the newly developed 
MIND MORE app not only is usable among older users but also could improve 
subjective sleep quality after a 1-week self-help intervention period.

BACKGROUND: Web-based interventions for depression have been widely tested for 
usability and functioning. However, the few studies that have addressed the 
therapeutic quality of these interventions have mainly focused on general 
aspects without consideration of specific quality factors related to particular 
treatment components. Clinicians and scientists are calling for standardized 
assessment criteria for web-based interventions to enable effective and 
trustworthy patient care. Therefore, an extensive evaluation of web-based 
interventions at the level of individual treatment components based on 
therapeutic guidelines and manuals is needed.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of unguided 
web-based interventions for depression at the level of individual treatment 
components based on their adherence to current gold-standard treatment 
guidelines and manuals.
METHODS: A comprehensive online search of popular app stores and search engines 
in January 2018 revealed 11 desktop programs and 17 smartphone apps that met the 
inclusion criteria. Programs and apps were included if they were available for 
German users, interactive, unguided, and targeted toward depression. All 
programs and apps were tested by three independent researchers following a 
standardized procedure with a predefined symptom trajectory. During the testing, 
all web-based interventions were rated with a standardized list of criteria 
based on treatment guidelines and manuals for depression.
RESULTS: Overall interrater reliability for all raters was substantial with an 
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.73 and Gwet AC1 value of 0.80. The main 
features of web-based interventions included mood tracking (24/28, 86%), 
psychoeducation (21/28, 75%), cognitive restructuring (21/28, 75%), crisis 
management (20/28, 71%), behavioral activation (19/29, 68%), and relaxation 
training (18/28, 64%). Overall, therapeutic meaningfulness was rated higher for 
desktop programs (mean 4.13, SD 1.17) than for smartphone apps (mean 2.92, SD 
1.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Although many exercises from manuals are included in web-based 
interventions, the necessary therapeutic depth of the interventions is often not 
reached, and risk management is frequently lacking. There is a need for further 
research targeting general principles for the development and evaluation of 
therapeutically sound web-based interventions for depression.

BACKGROUND: Adolescent depression is a significant public health concern; 
however, access to effective mental health care is limited. Digital therapeutics 
(DTx) can improve access to evidence-based interventions; however, their 
efficacy in adolescents is sparsely documented.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the efficacy of a mobile app DTx versus an 
active control as an adjunct treatment for adolescent depression symptoms.
METHODS: An internet-based open-label randomized control trial was conducted 
nationwide with a partial crossover design, and 168 adolescents aged 13 to 21 
years with symptoms of depression were recruited between November 2020 and 
September 2021. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the cognitive behavioral 
therapy-based treatment app (Spark) or to a psychoeducational control app 
(control), which they would use for a duration of 5 weeks. The primary outcome 
was a between-group (Spark vs control) difference in the change in depression 
symptoms from baseline to postintervention, as measured by the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) using a linear mixed-effects analysis. The PHQ-8 ranges 
from 0 to 24, with scores of 5 to 9 indicating mild depression symptoms, scores 
of 10 to 14 indicating moderate symptoms, scores of 15 to 19 indicating 
moderately severe symptoms, and scores of 20 to 24 indicating severe symptoms. A 
minimal clinically important difference (5-point reduction between baseline and 
postintervention) in the Spark arm and group differences in remission and 
treatment response rates based on the PHQ-8 at postintervention were also 
investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 160 participants were randomized, 80 in the Spark arm (mean 
age 16.89, SD 2.5 y) and 80 in the control arm (mean age 16.79, SD 2.59 y). Data 
from 121 participants (Spark: n=63; control: n=58) with moderate to severe 
(PHQ-8≥10) symptoms at baseline were included in the primary analyses following 
a modified intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed-effect analysis revealed 
a nonsignificant difference between the study arms in depression symptom change 
over the intervention period. The Spark arm met a minimal clinically important 
difference threshold (mean -5.08, 95% CI -6.72 to -3.42). The remission rate in 
the Spark arm was significantly higher than that in the control arm (11/63, 17% 
vs 2/58, 3%; χ21=6.2; P=.01; false discovery rate-adjusted P=.03). The treatment 
response rates were not significantly different between the study arms (P=.07; 
false discovery rate-adjusted P=.16). Post hoc analyses including participants 
with mild to severe (PHQ-8 score ≥5) symptoms at baseline revealed promising 
evidence that Spark is effective in those with mild to severe symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: There is initial evidence that a self-guided, cognitive behavioral 
therapy-based DTx intervention may effectively treat mild to severe depression 
symptoms in adolescents. DTx may improve access to mental health care for 
adolescents or serve as an important adjunct to the standard of care.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a potential treatment strategy 
across some psychiatric conditions. However, there is high heterogeneity in tDCS 
efficacy as a stand-alone treatment. To increase its therapeutic potential, 
researchers have begun to explore the efficacy of combining tDCS with 
psychological and pharmacological interventions. The current case series details 
the effect of 6-10 weeks of self-administered tDCS paired with a behavioral 
therapy smartphone app (Flow™), on depressive and anxiety symptoms, in seven 
patients (26-51 years old; four female) presenting distinctive psychiatric 
disorders (major depression, dysthymia, illness anxiety disorder, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorders). tDCS protocol consisted 
of an acute phase of daily 30 min sessions, across 10 workdays (2 weeks 
Monday-to-Friday; Protocol 1) or 15 workdays (3 weeks Monday-to-Friday; Protocol 
2). A maintenance phase followed, with twice-weekly sessions for 4 or 3 weeks, 
corresponding to 18 or 21 sessions in total (Protocol 1 or 2, respectively). The 
Flow tDCS device uses a 2 mA current intensity, targeting the bilateral 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The Flow app offers virtually guided behavioral 
therapy courses to be completed during stimulation. We assessed depressive 
symptoms using MADRS-S and BDI-II, anxious symptoms using STAI-Trait, 
acceptability using ACCEPT-tDCS, and side effects using the Adverse Effects 
Questionnaire, at baseline and week 6 of treatment. Six patients underwent 
simultaneous cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and two were on antidepressants 
and benzodiazepines. According to the Reliable Change Index (RCI), for 
depressive symptoms, we found clinically reliable improvement in five patients 
using MADRS-S (out of seven; RCI: -1.45, 80% CI; RCI: -2.17 to -4.82, 95% CI; 
percentage change: 37.9-66.7%) and in four patients using BDI-II (out of five; 
RCI: -3.61 to -6.70, 95% CI; percentage change: 57.1-100%). For anxiety 
symptoms, clinically reliable improvement was observed in five patients (out of 
six; RCI: -1.79, 90% CI; RCI: -2.55 to -8.64, 95% CI; percentage change: 
12.3-46.4%). Stimulation was well-tolerated and accepted, with mild tingling 
sensation and scalp discomfort being the most common side effects. This case 
series highlights the applicability, acceptability, and promising results when 
combining home-based tDCS with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy to manage 
depression and anxiety symptoms in clinical practice.

Introduction: Mental health mobile apps (MHapps) can provide depression 
treatment to people worldwide who do not have access to care, but few apps are 
culturally targeted to the population. In this series of studies, we described 
sociocultural considerations of MHapp development, and we explored participants' 
perceptions of acceptability, usability, and cultural relevance of the MHapp. 
Method: Individual interviews were conducted in three separate primary care 
sites in the Dominican Republic among convenience samples of staff and patients 
(n = 23, 18, and 21, respectively), using mixed methods of data collection. 
Results: Modifications were made during the iterative design process to reflect 
user preferences, which included a female gendered voice, the addition of 
animations, and changes to the psychoeducational content. Discussion: Primary 
care patients reported strong interest in MHapps due to its convenience, 
privacy, and affordability. Our findings support the necessity of detailed 
examination of user preferences to develop culturally congruent MHapp 
psychoeducation.

BACKGROUND: Limited English Proficiency (LEP) Latinxs experience a longer 
duration of untreated depression and anxiety. LEP Latinxs have difficulty 
accessing mental healthcare due to insufficient Spanish-speaking 
behavioral/mental health clinicians to meet demand. These under-resourced 
healthcare systems are less likely to be the site for the implementation of 
innovations. Digital interventions can provide an effective option for 
overcoming these barriers; yet, when digital evidence-based treatments are 
available, uptake and engagement is often low. This manuscript presents the 
protocol for the SUPERA (SUpport from PEeRs to expand Access) study which will 
evaluate the implementation of an evidence-based, Spanish language, digital 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (dCBT) intervention (i.e., SilverCloud) in 
safety-net primary care clinics for LEP Latinx patients with depression or 
anxiety.
METHODS: We will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial (Type 2) 
design comparing engagement and clinical outcomes in two modalities of dCBT 
delivery (peer-supported vs. unsupported). We will also compare provider-level 
outreach (using a clinic patient registry) versus inreach (traditional provider 
referral) to compare rates of initiation, completion, and cost. Participants 
will be 426 LEP Latinx adults ≥18 years of age, PHQ-9 ≥ 10 or GAD-7 ≥ 8, with 
access to the internet via smartphone, and not currently receiving individual 
psychotherapy. We will collect baseline, post-intervention (8 weeks), and follow 
up (3 months) data.
CONCLUSION: The long-term goal of this research is to aid in the implementation 
of digital mental health interventions that can be sustainably implemented in 
low-resourced settings, while reducing the reliance on professionals, overcoming 
workforce deficits, and increasing relevance for diverse populations.

Background Text messaging services could increase access to psychotherapeutic 
content for individuals with depression by avoiding barriers to in-person 
psychotherapy such as cost, transportation, and therapist availability. 
Determining whether text messages reflecting different psychotherapeutic 
techniques exhibit differences in acceptability or effectiveness may help guide 
service development. Objectives We aimed to determine: (1) the feasibility of 
delivering a psychotherapy-based text messaging service to people with 
depression identified via the internet, (2) whether there is variation in 
satisfaction with messages according to the type of psychotherapeutic technique 
they represent, and (3) whether symptoms of depression vary according to receipt 
of each message type and participants' satisfaction with the messages they 
received. Methods For this study 190 US adults who screened positive for a major 
depressive episode (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10) were 
recruited from online advertisements. Participants received a daily 
psychotherapy-based text message 6 days per week for 12 weeks. Text messages 
were developed by a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers to 
reflect three psychotherapeutic approaches: acceptance and commitment therapy 
(ACT), behavioural activation, and cognitive restructuring. Each week the 
message type for the week was randomly assigned from one of the three types, 
allowing for repeats. Participants were asked daily to rate each message. On the 
7th day of each week, participants completed a two-item depression screener 
(PHQ-2). Web-based surveys at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks were used as the primary 
measure of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Results Of the 190 participants 
enrolled, 85 (45%) completed the 6-week web survey and 67 (35%) completed the 
12-week survey. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 19.4 (SD 4.2) and there was a 
statistically significant mean improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -2.9 (SD 6.0; 
p < 0.001) at 6 weeks and -4.8 (SD 6.6; p < 0.001) at 12 weeks. Mean 
satisfaction ratings did not vary across message types. There was generally no 
association between the number of weeks in which participants received a given 
message type and PHQ-9 scores at follow-up. However, among individuals with more 
severe depression at baseline (PHQ-9 ≥ 20; n = 30), the number of weeks of 
behavioural activation messages received was associated with less symptom 
improvement (ρ = 0.37; p = 0.04) at 12 weeks. Participants who gave higher 
satisfaction ratings to messages regardless of type had greater reductions in 
PHQ-9 scores at 6 weeks. Conclusions Study participants exhibited borderline 
clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks suggesting 
the effects of the intervention, if any, were small. Although there was no 
overall variation in changes in PHQ-9 according to users' exposure to the three 
message types, effectiveness among severely depressed participants could 
potentially be improved by tailoring towards fewer behavioural activation 
messages. Controlled studies to determine effectiveness of texting interventions 
such as this one are indicated considering that even small effects may be cost 
effective given the low cost of delivering text messages.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurotransmitter changes in youth addicted to the 
Internet and smartphone were compared with normal controls and in subjects after 
cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, the correlations between 
neurotransmitters and affective factors were investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen young people with Internet and smartphone 
addiction and 19 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (male/female ratio, 9:10; 
mean age, 15.47 ± 3.06 years) were included. Twelve teenagers with Internet and 
smartphone addiction (male/female ratio, 8:4; mean age, 14.99 ± 1.95 years) 
participated in 9 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy. Meshcher-Garwood 
point-resolved spectroscopy was used to measure γ-aminobutyric acid and Glx 
levels in the anterior cingulate cortex. The γ-aminobutyric acid and Glx levels 
in the addicted group were compared with those in controls and after cognitive 
behavioral therapy. The γ-aminobutyric acid and Glx levels correlated with 
clinical scales of Internet and smartphone addiction, impulsiveness, depression, 
anxiety, insomnia, and sleep quality.
RESULTS: Brain parenchymal and gray matter volume-adjusted γ-aminobutyric 
acid-to-creatine ratios were higher in subjects with Internet and smartphone 
addiction (P = .028 and .016). After therapy, brain parenchymal- and gray matter 
volume-adjusted γ-aminobutyric acid-to-creatine ratios were decreased (P = .034 
and .026). The Glx level was not statistically significant in subjects with 
Internet and smartphone addiction compared with controls and posttherapy status. 
Brain parenchymal- and gray matter volume-adjusted γ-aminobutyric 
acid-to-creatine ratios correlated with clinical scales of Internet and 
smartphone addictions, depression, and anxiety. Glx/Cr was negatively correlated 
with insomnia and sleep quality scales.
CONCLUSIONS: The high γ-aminobutyric acid levels and disrupted balance of 
γ-aminobutyric acid-to-Glx including glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex 
may contribute to understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of Internet 
and smartphone addiction and associated comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Perinatal mood disorders are common yet underdiagnosed and un- or 
undertreated. Barriers exist to accessing perinatal mental health services, 
including limited availability, time, and cost. Automated conversational agents 
(chatbots) can deliver evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy content 
through text message-based conversations and reduce depression and anxiety 
symptoms in select populations. Such digital mental health technologies are 
poised to overcome barriers to mental health care access but need to be 
evaluated for efficacy, as well as for preliminary feasibility and acceptability 
among perinatal populations.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a mental 
health chatbot for mood management in a general postpartum population.
STUDY DESIGN: An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a 
tertiary academic center. English-speaking postpartum women aged 18 years or 
above with a live birth and access to a smartphone were eligible for enrollment 
prior to discharge from delivery hospitalization. Baseline surveys were 
administered to all participants prior to randomization to a mental health 
chatbot intervention or to usual care only. The intervention group downloaded 
the mental health chatbot smartphone application with perinatal-specific 
content, in addition to continuing usual care. Usual care consisted of routine 
postpartum follow up and mental health care as dictated by the patient's 
obstetric provider. Surveys were administered during delivery hospitalization 
(baseline) and at 2-, 4-, and 6-weeks postpartum to assess depression and 
anxiety symptoms. The primary outcome was a change in depression symptoms at 
6-weeks as measured using two depression screening tools: Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes 
included anxiety symptoms measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and 
satisfaction and acceptability using validated scales. Based on a prior study, 
we estimated a sample size of 130 would have sufficient (80%) power to detect a 
moderate effect size (d=.4) in between group difference on the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9.
RESULTS: A total of 192 women were randomized equally 1:1 to the chatbot or 
usual care; of these, 152 women completed the 6-week survey (n=68 chatbot, n=84 
usual care) and were included in the final analysis. Mean baseline mental health 
assessment scores were below positive screening thresholds. At 6-weeks, there 
was a greater decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores among the 
chatbot group compared to the usual care group (mean decrease=1.32, standard 
deviation=3.4 vs mean decrease=0.13, standard deviation=3.01, respectively). 
6-week mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder-7 scores did not differ between groups and were similar to baseline. 
91% (n=62) of the chatbot users were satisfied or highly satisfied with the 
chatbot, and 74% (n=50) of the intervention group reported use of the chatbot at 
least once in 2 weeks prior to the 6-week survey. 80% of study participants 
reported being comfortable with the use of a mobile smartphone application for 
mood management.
CONCLUSION: Use of a chatbot was acceptable to women in the early postpartum 
period. The sample did not screen positive for depression at baseline and thus 
the potential of the chatbot to reduce depressive symptoms in this population 
was limited. This study was conducted in a general obstetric population. Future 
studies of longer duration in high-risk postpartum populations who screen 
positive for depression are needed to further understand the utility and 
efficacy of such digital therapeutics for that population.

BACKGROUND: Despite substantial improvements in technology and the increased 
demand for technology-enabled behavioral health tools among consumers, little 
progress has been made in easing the burden of mental illness. This may be 
because of the inherent challenges of conducting traditional clinical trials in 
a rapidly evolving technology landscape.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to validate the effectiveness of Pacifica, a 
popular commercially available app for the self-management of mild-to-moderate 
stress, anxiety, and depression.
METHODS: A total of 500 adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depression were 
recruited from in-app onboarding to participate in a randomized waitlist 
controlled trial of Pacifica. We conducted an all-virtual study, recruiting, 
screening, and randomizing participants through a Web-based participant portal. 
Study participants used the app for 1 month, with no level of use required, 
closely mimicking real-world app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were 
given access to the app after 1 month. Measurements included self-reported 
symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. We performed an 
intent-to-treat analysis to examine the interactive effects of time and 
condition.
RESULTS: We found significant interactions between time and group. Participants 
in the active condition demonstrated significantly greater decreases in 
depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in self-efficacy. Although we did 
not find a relationship between overall engagement with the app and symptom 
improvement, participants who completed relatively more thought record exercises 
sustained improvements in their symptoms through the 2-month follow-up to a 
greater degree than those who completed fewer. In addition, we found that 
participants who reported concomitantly taking psychiatric medications during 
the trial benefitted less from the app, as measured by the symptoms of anxiety 
and stress.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that Pacifica, a popular commercially 
available self-help app, is effective in reducing self-reported symptoms of 
depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly among individuals who utilize 
thought records and are not taking psychiatric medication.

INTRODUCTION: The IMPACT study focuses on chronic low back pain (CLBP) and 
depression symptoms, a prevalent and complex problem that represents a challenge 
for health professionals. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Brief 
Behavioural Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) are effective treatments 
for patients with persistent pain and depression, respectively. The objectives 
of this 12 month, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) are (i) to 
examine the efficacy and cost-utility of adding a group-based form of ACT or 
BATD to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for patients with CLBP and moderate to severe 
levels of depressive symptoms; (ii) identify pre-post differences in levels of 
some physiological variables and (iii) analyse the role of polymorphisms in the 
FKBP5 gene, psychological process measures and physiological variables as 
mediators or moderators of long-term clinical changes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants will be 225 patients with CLBP and moderate 
to severe depression symptoms recruited at Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu (St. 
Boi de Llobregat, Spain) and Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain), randomly 
allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU vs TAU+ACT versus TAU+BATD. A 
comprehensive assessment to collect clinical variables and costs will be 
conducted pretreatment, post-treatment and at 12 months follow-up, being pain 
interference the primary outcome measure. The following physiological variables 
will be considered at pretreatment and post-treatment assessments in 50% of the 
sample: immune-inflammatory markers, hair cortisol and cortisone, serum 
cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin and vitamin D. Polymorphisms in the 
FKBP5 gene (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780, rs9470080 and rs4713916) will be 
analysed at baseline assessment. Moreover, we will include 
mobile-technology-based ecological momentary assessment, through the Pain 
Monitor app, to track ongoing clinical status during ACT and BATD treatments. 
Linear mixed-effects models using restricted maximum likelihood, and a full 
economic evaluation applying bootstrapping techniques, acceptability curves and 
sensitivity analyses will be computed.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the Fundació Sant Joan de Déu and Hospital del Mar. The results will be 
actively disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, 
social media and various community engagement activities.

Aging populations are at increased risk of sleep deficiencies (e.g., insomnia) 
that are associated with a variety of chronic health risks, including 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Insomnia medications carry 
additional risk, including increased drowsiness and falls, as well as 
polypharmacy risks. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), but access is limited. 
Telehealth is one way to increase access, particularly for older adults, but to 
date telehealth has been typically limited to simple videoconferencing portals. 
While these portals have been shown to be non-inferior to in-person treatment, 
it is plausible that telehealth could be significantly improved. This work 
describes a protocol designed to evaluate whether a clinician-patient dashboard 
inclusive of several user-friendly features (e.g., patterns of sleep data from 
ambulatory devices, guided relaxation resources, and reminders to complete 
in-home CBTi practice) could improve CBTi outcomes for middle- to older-aged 
adults (N = 100). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three telehealth 
interventions delivered through 6-weekly sessions: (1) CBTi augmented with a 
clinician-patient dashboard, smartphone application, and integrated smart 
devices; (2) standard CBTi (i.e., active comparator); or (3) sleep hygiene 
education (i.e., active control). All participants were assessed at screening, 
pre-study evaluation, baseline, throughout treatment, and at 1-week 
post-treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary 
and exploratory outcomes span sleep diary, actiwatch and Apple watch assessed 
sleep parameters (e.g., efficiency, duration, timing, variability), psychosocial 
correlates (e.g., fatigue, depression, stress), cognitive performance, treatment 
adherence, and neurodegenerative and systemic inflammatory biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Reducing the disease burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is of 
major public health relevance. The prevention of depression is regarded as one 
possible approach to reach this goal. People with multiple risk factors for MDD 
such as chronic back pain and subthreshold depressive symptoms may benefit most 
from preventive measures. The Internet as intervention setting allows for 
scaling up preventive interventions on a public mental health level.
METHODS: This study is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
of parallel design aiming to investigate the (cost-) effectiveness of an 
Internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) for the prevention of depression 
in chronic back pain patients (PROD-BP) with subthreshold depressive symptoms. 
eSano BackCare-DP is a guided, chronic back pain-specific depression prevention 
intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles comprising 
six weekly plus three optional modules and two booster sessions after completion 
of the intervention. Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback 
messages after each module. A total of 406 patients with chronic back pain and 
without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic 
rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment-as-usual 
(TAU). Primary patient-relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of 
MDD measured by the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM 
(SCID) at baseline and 1-year post-randomization. Key secondary outcomes are 
health-related quality of life, depression severity, pain intensity, 
pain-related disability, ability to work, intervention satisfaction and 
adherence as well as side effects of the intervention. Online assessments take 
place at baseline and 9 weeks as well as 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Cox 
regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at 
12-month follow-up. Moreover, an economic analysis will be conducted from a 
societal and public health perspective.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention 
in a sample of chronic pain patients. If this implementation of a depression 
prevention IMI into orthopedic aftercare proves effective, the intervention 
could be integrated into routine care with minimal costs and extended for use 
with other chronic diseases. Results will have implications for researchers, 
health care providers and public health policy makers.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD). 
Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do 
not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and 
scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in 
reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced 
mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy 
mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known 
regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in 
postpartum women with depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women 
with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms.
METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness 
intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large 
integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician 
referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression 
screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included 
the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation 
practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 
min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on 
patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and 
mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and 
adherence were used to assess feasibility.
RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or 
declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In 
addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 
years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, 
participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the 
study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 
47%) used the app on ≥50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of 
the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) 
reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews 
indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the 
program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in 
pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: 
-3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: -6.0, P=.005), 
and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: -2.1, P=.02, indicating less 
sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five 
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01).
CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with 
moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable. An 
efficacy trial is warranted.

Trial.

BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen a significant increase in the availability of 
smartphone apps for mental health problems. Despite their proliferation, few 
apps have been specifically developed for young people, and almost none have 
been subject to any form of evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to undertake a preliminary evaluation of a 
smartphone app (BlueIce), coproduced with young people and designed to help 
young people manage distress and urges to self-harm. We aimed to assess the 
acceptability, safety, and use of BlueIce and to explore the effects on the 
primary outcome of self-harm and the secondary outcomes of psychological 
functioning.
METHODS: We undertook an open trial where we recruited young people aged 12 to 
17 years attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services 
(CAMHS) who were currently self-harming or had a history of self-harm. Eligible 
participants were assessed at baseline and then given BlueIce. They were 
assessed 2 weeks later (post familiarization) and again at 12 weeks (post use). 
A behavior-screening questionnaire (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) 
was completed along with standardized measures of depression (Mood and Feelings 
Questionnaire or MFQ) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale or 
RCADS), taking into account self-reports of self-harm, app helpfulness, and 
safety.
RESULTS: All core CAMHS professional groups referred at least 1 young person. 
Out of 40 young people recruited, 37 (93%) elected to use BlueIce after 
familiarization, with 29 out of 33 (88%) wanting to keep it at the end of the 
study. No young person called the emergency numbers during the 12-week trial, 
and no one was withdrawn by his or her clinician due to increased risk of 
suicide. Almost three-quarters (73%) of those who had recently self-harmed 
reported reductions in self-harm after using BlueIce for 12 weeks. There was a 
statistically significant mean difference of 4.91 (t31=2.11; P=.04; 95% CI 
0.17-9.64) on postuse symptoms of depression (MFQ) and 13.53 on symptoms of 
anxiety (RCADS) (t30=3.76; P=.001; 95% CI 6.17-20.90), which was evident across 
all anxiety subscales. Ratings of app acceptability and usefulness were high.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has a number of methodological limitations, particularly 
the absence of a comparison group and a prospective way of assessing self-harm. 
Nonetheless, our findings are encouraging and suggest that BlueIce, used 
alongside a traditional CAMHS face-to-face intervention, can help young people 
manage their emotional distress and urges to self-harm.

BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the most common complications of childbirth, 
and is experienced by approximately 17% of pregnant women and 13% of postpartum 
women. An estimated 85% of these women go untreated-an alarming statistic given 
the serious consequences for the mother, her child, other family members, and 
society. Professional societies (the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists and American Academy of Pediatrics) have recommended improvements 
in screening and treatment. Meta-analyses indicate that cognitive behavioral 
therapy eHealth interventions are efficacious for depression, generally, and for 
perinatal depression, specifically. Earlier controlled trials have established 
the effectiveness and acceptability of MomMoodBooster (including an Australian 
version, MumMoodBooster), an eHealth program for ameliorating postpartum 
depression.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a perinatal version 
of MomMoodBooster encompassing both prenatal and postpartum content in a 
healthcare delivery setting already providing universal screening and referral 
of at-risk patients as part of routine care.
STUDY DESIGN: A practical effectiveness study randomly assigned 95 pregnant and 
96 postpartum women screened as depressed and satisfying eligibility criteria to 
experimental groups: the healthcare organization's perinatal depression care 
program (routine-care group) and routine care+MomMoodBooster2 program (eHealth 
group). Eligibility criteria included: pregnant or <1 year postpartum, ≥18 years 
of age, no active suicidal ideation, access to broadband internet via 
desktop/laptop, tablet, or smartphone, and English language proficiency.
RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses of group effects used fixed-effects growth 
models to assess 12-week posttest change in outcomes. Results showed that both 
groups had significantly decreased depression severity, anxiety, stress, and 
automatic thoughts, and increased behavioral activation and self-efficacy. 
Relative to the routine-care group, the eHealth group displayed significantly 
greater decreases in depression severity and stress. These group comparisons 
were not moderated by depression severity (screening or baseline), anxiety, 
stress, or pregnant/postpartum status. Almost all (93%; n=89) women in the 
eHealth group visited their program, of whom 99% visited program sessions (M 
sessions visited=4.3±2.0; M total session duration=73.0±70.2 minutes; 49% viewed 
all 6 sessions). Among confirmed eHealth program users who provided ratings, 96% 
(79/82) rated their program as easy to use, 83% rated it helpful, and 93% 
(76/82) indicated that they would recommend it.
CONCLUSION: Results support the effectiveness of using MomMoodBooster2 as a 
treatment option for perinatal women with depression, especially when combined 
with universal depression screening and referral. Consequently, the eHealth 
program shows promise as a tool to increase the reach of treatment delivery and 
to potentially reduce the number of untreated perinatal women with depression.

BACKGROUND: Depression is often comorbid with diabetes; however, undertreatment 
of depressive symptoms in people affected is common.
OBJECTIVE: We studied preliminary acceptability and effectiveness of a fully 
automated, mobile phone, and web-based public health intervention, myCompass, 
for reducing depressive symptoms and improving mental health comorbidities in 
people with diabetes.
METHODS: In this single-group feasibility study, 89 volunteers with type 1 
(n=34) or type 2 (n=55) diabetes and at least mild depressive symptoms used 
myCompass for 7 weeks. Web-based measures of depressive and anxious symptoms, 
functional impairment, diabetes-specific variables, and user satisfaction were 
completed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Retention rates were 54% (n=48) at postintervention and 36% (n=32) at 
follow-up. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved at postintervention 
(P<.001; within-group effect size d=1.05), with gains persisting at follow-up. 
Mental health comorbidities, including anxiety (P<.001), functioning (P<.001), 
and diabetes-specific distress (P<.001), also showed significant and sustained 
improvement. Satisfaction with myCompass was high, with convenience and ease of 
program use, and relevance of program content rated positively by participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The myCompass program shows promise as an acceptable and effective 
treatment for depression and comorbid mental health problems in people with 
diabetes. The program is broadly available, free to use, and may benefit 
patients with diabetes who do not access services and/or wish to manage their 
mental health themselves. Replication of these findings in a controlled study is 
warranted.

OBJECTIVE: Smartphones are being used with increasing frequency to deliver 
behavioral interventions for depression via apps. However, barriers specific to 
using an app for depression are poorly defined. The purpose of the current study 
is to identify barriers to the use of a mobile app to deliver treatment for 
depression. Secondarily, design implications will be provided based upon 
identified barriers.
METHOD: A card sorting task that ranked and grouped barriers to the use of apps 
for depression was completed. Participants first completed a card sorting task 
identifying barriers to face-to-face treatment, as a primer to identification of 
treatment barriers. The sample consisted of those above (n = 9) and below 
(n = 11) the threshold for a referral to psychotherapy, to capture anticipated 
barriers for likely end users. Cluster analyses were conducted to analyze the 
card sorting data. Multiple analyses were conducted to identify: 1) the most 
important barriers, and 2) how consistently barriers were ranked as important.
RESULT: The card sorting task identified a number of primary barriers to the use 
of apps for depression treatment, including concerns over intervention efficacy, 
app functioning, privacy, cost, and lack of guidance and tailored feedback. The 
top face-to-face treatment barrier was cost, overlapping with mobile barriers.
CONCLUSION: This study identified perceived barriers to the use of mobile 
treatment apps. Identification of barriers implicates design recommendations for 
apps for depression.

BACKGROUND: Mental illness is a pervasive worldwide public health issue. 
Residentially vulnerable populations, such as those living in rural medically 
underserved areas (MUAs) or mental health provider shortage areas (MHPSAs), face 
unique access barriers to mental health care. Despite the growth of digital 
mental health interventions using relational agent technology, little is known 
about their use patterns, efficacy, and favorability among residentially 
vulnerable populations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore differences in app use, therapeutic 
alliance, mental health outcomes, and satisfaction across residential subgroups 
(metropolitan, nonmetropolitan, or rural), MUAs (yes or no), and MHPSAs (yes or 
no) among users of a smartphone-based, digital mental health intervention, 
Woebot LIFE (WB-LIFE). WB-LIFE was designed to help users better understand and 
manage their moods and features a relational agent, Woebot, that converses 
through text-based messages.
METHODS: We used an exploratory study that examined data from 255 adults 
enrolled in an 8-week, single-arm trial of WB-LIFE. Analyses compared levels of 
app use and therapeutic alliance total scores as well as subscales (goal, task, 
and bond), mental health outcomes (depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, 
resilience, and burnout), and program satisfaction across residential subgroups.
RESULTS: Few study participants resided in nonmetropolitan (25/255, 10%) or 
rural (3/255, 1%) areas, precluding estimates across this variable. Despite a 
largely metropolitan sample, nearly 39% (99/255) resided in an MUA and 55% 
(141/255) in an MHPSA. There were no significant differences in app use or 
satisfaction by MUA or MHPSA status. There also were no differences in 
depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, resilience, or burnout, with the exception 
of MUA participants having higher baseline depressive symptoms among those 
starting in the moderate range or higher (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item 
scale≥10) than non-MUA participants (mean 16.50 vs 14.41, respectively; P=.01). 
Although working alliance scores did not differ by MHPSA status, those who 
resided in an MUA had higher goal (2-tailed t203.47=2.21; P=.03), and bond 
(t203.47=1.94; P=.05) scores at day 3 (t192.98=2.15; P=.03), and higher goal 
scores at week 8 (t186.19=2.28; P=.02) as compared with those not living in an 
MUA.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the study not recruiting many participants from rural or 
nonmetropolitan populations, sizable proportions resided in an MUA or an MHPSA. 
Analyses revealed few differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental 
health outcomes (including baseline levels), or satisfaction across MUA or MHPSA 
status over the 8-week study. Findings suggest that vulnerable residential 
populations may benefit from using digital agent-guided cognitive behavioral 
therapy.

Self-Guided Smartphone App (Vimbo) for the Reduction of Symptoms of Depression 
and Anxiety in South African Adults: Pilot Quantitative Single-Arm Study.

BACKGROUND: Barriers to mental health assessment and intervention have been well 
documented within South Africa, in both urban and rural settings. 
Internationally, evidence has emerged for the effectiveness of technology and, 
specifically, app-based mental health tools and interventions to help overcome 
some of these barriers. However, research on digital interventions specific to 
the South African context and mental health is limited.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study investigated the feasibility of using an app (Vimbo) 
to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression in South African adults recruited 
from a community sample. The Vimbo app is a self-guided, cognitive behavioral 
therapy-based digital intervention for common mental health difficulties 
developed for the South African context.
METHODS: This pilot study used a naturalistic, single-arm design testing the 
Vimbo app over 12 weeks, from October 2020 to February 2021. Participants were 
recruited through the South African Depression and Anxiety Group and social 
media advertisements online. A 2-week retention period was used to allow for a 
minimum of 2 datasets. App usage and engagement metrics were extracted directly 
from the back end of the app. Based on the model, researchers expected many 
users to discontinue usage when their symptom levels entered a healthy range. 
Pre-post review of symptom levels was used to reflect on clinical recovery 
status at discontinuation after the retention period.
RESULTS: A total of 218 applicants met study eligibility criteria and were 
invited to download the Vimbo app. Of these, 52% (114/218) of the participants 
registered with the app, who indicated multiple variances of depression and 
anxiety symptoms ranging in severity from mild to severe. Two participants users 
withdrew from the study. Moreover, 69% (77/112) of users were retained, 
including 8 who had technical issues with their treatment. When comparing broad 
uptake across all interested participants, chi-square analysis indicated 
significantly reduced uptake in participants identifying as "unemployed but 
seeking employment" (χ24=10.47; N=251; P=.03). When considering app usage for 
the entire cohort (n=69, excluding participants with technical issues), there 
was a mean of 72.87 (SD 71.425) total module pages read, a mean of 30% (SD 
29.473%) of prescribed content completed, and a mean of 19.93 (SD 27.517) times 
engaging with tools and skills.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the case for continued exploration of 
app-based interventions for treating depression and anxiety in South Africa. 
Developing strategies to increase access and improve intervention uptake may 
prove essential to helping mobile health interventions make as significant an 
impact as possible. Future research should include a randomized controlled trial 
with a larger sample to further assess the efficacy of app-based interventions 
in treating mental health difficulties in South Africa.

BACKGROUND: Rising rates of psychological distress (symptoms of depression, 
anxiety, and stress) among adults in the United States necessitate effective 
mental wellness interventions. Despite the prevalence of smartphone app-based 
programs, research on their efficacy is limited, with only 14% showing 
clinically validated evidence. Our study evaluates Noom Mood, a commercially 
available smartphone-based app that uses cognitive behavioral therapy and 
mindfulness-based programming. In this study, we address gaps in the existing 
literature by examining postintervention outcomes and the broader impact on 
mental wellness.
OBJECTIVE: Noom Mood is a smartphone-based mental wellness program designed to 
be used by the general population. This prospective study evaluates the efficacy 
and postintervention outcomes of Noom Mood. We aim to address the rising 
psychological distress among adults in the United States.
METHODS: A 1-arm study design was used, with participants having access to the 
Noom Mood program for 16 weeks (N=273). Surveys were conducted at baseline, week 
4, week 8, week 12, week 16, and week 32 (16 weeks' postprogram follow-up). This 
study assessed a range of mental health outcomes, including anxiety symptoms, 
depressive symptoms, perceived stress, well-being, quality of life, coping, 
emotion regulation, sleep, and workplace productivity (absenteeism or 
presenteeism).
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 40.5 (SD 11.7) years. Statistically 
significant improvements in anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and perceived 
stress were observed by week 4 and maintained through the 16-week intervention 
and the 32-week follow-up. The largest changes were observed in the first 4 
weeks (29% lower, 25% lower, and 15% lower for anxiety symptoms, depressive 
symptoms, and perceived stress, respectively), and only small improvements were 
observed afterward. Reductions in clinically relevant anxiety (7-item 
generalized anxiety disorder scale) and depression (8-item Patient Health 
Questionnaire depression scale) criteria were also maintained from program 
initiation through the 16-week intervention and the 32-week follow-up. Work 
productivity also showed statistically significant results, with participants 
gaining 2.57 productive work days from baseline at 16 weeks, and remaining 
relatively stable (2.23 productive work days gained) at follow-up (32 weeks). 
Additionally, effects across all coping, sleep disturbance (23% lower at 32 
weeks), and emotion dysregulation variables exhibited positive and significant 
trends at all time points (15% higher, 23% lower, and 25% higher respectively at 
32 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes insights into the promising positive impact 
of Noom Mood on mental health and well-being outcomes, extending beyond the 
intervention phase. Though more rigorous studies are necessary to understand the 
mechanism of action at play, this exploratory study addresses critical gaps in 
the literature, highlighting the potential of smartphone-based mental wellness 
programs to lessen barriers to mental health support and improve diverse 
dimensions of well-being. Future research should explore the scalability, 
feasibility, and long-term adherence of such interventions across diverse 
populations.

Mobile Apps for Management of Tinnitus: Users' Survey, Quality Assessment, and 
Content Analysis.

Montfort University, Leicester, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is the perception of a sound without any outside source. It 
affects 6 million people in the United Kingdom. Sound therapy is a core 
component of many tinnitus management programs. Potential mechanisms of benefit 
include making tinnitus less noticeable, habituation, distracting attention from 
tinnitus, relaxation, and promoting neuroplastic changes within the brain. In 
recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the use of mobile 
technology. This provided an additional medium through which people with 
tinnitus can access different tinnitus management options, including sound 
therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to (1) generate the list of apps that 
people use for management of their tinnitus, (2) explore reasons for app use and 
nonuse, (3) perform quality assessment of the most cited apps, and (4) perform 
content analysis to explore and describe options and management techniques 
available in the most cited apps.
METHODS: A Web-based survey consisting of 33 open and closed questions captured 
(1) demographic information, information about tinnitus, and hearing loss and 
(2) mobile app-specific information about the motivation to use an app, the apps 
which respondents used for tinnitus, important factors when choosing an app, 
devices used to access apps, and reasons for not using apps. The quality of the 
most cited apps was assessed using the Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS). Content 
and features of the most cited apps were analyzed.
RESULTS: Data from 643 respondents were analyzed. The majority of respondents 
(482/643, 75.0%) had never used an app for management of tinnitus mainly because 
of lack of awareness (381/643, 59.3%). The list of the 55 apps that people use 
for their tinnitus was generated. These included apps that were developed 
specifically for the management of tinnitus; however, the majority of cited apps 
were developed for other problems (eg, sleep, depression or anxiety, and 
relaxation). Quality assessment of the 18 most popular apps using MARS resulted 
in a range of mean scores from 1.6 to 4.2 (out of 5). In line with the current 
model of tinnitus management, sound was the main focus of the majority of the 
apps. Other components included relaxation exercises, elements of cognitive 
behavioral therapy, information and education, and hypnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: People used apps for the management of their tinnitus; however, 
this was done mostly as a self-help option, without conjunction with management 
provided by hearing health care professionals. Further research should consider 
the place for apps in tinnitus management (stand-alone self-management 
intervention vs part of the management by a hearing professional). As the 
content of the apps varies with respect to sound options, information, and 
management strategies, it seems that the choice of the best management app 
should be guided by individual patient's needs and preferences.

BACKGRUOUND: This study examines integrating physical and mental healthcare for 
disadvantaged persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild-to-moderate 
depression in the community, using a mobile application within a 
public-private-academic partnership.
METHODS: The Korean Diabetes Association has developed a mobile application 
combining behavioral activation for psychological well-being and diabetes 
self-management, with conventional medical therapy. Participants were randomly 
assigned to receive the application with usual care or only usual care. Primary 
outcomes measured changes in psychological status and diabetes selfmanagement 
through questionnaires at week 12 from the baseline. Secondary outcomes assessed 
glycemic and lipid control, with psychological assessments at week 16.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 73 participants completed the study (20 and 19 in the 
intervention and control groups, respectively) and were included in the 
analysis. At week 12, the intervention group showed significant reductions in 
depression severity and perceived stress compared to the control group. 
Additionally, they reported increased perceived social support and demonstrated 
improved diabetes self-care behavior. These positive effects persisted through 
week 16, with the added benefit of reduced anxiety. While fasting glucose levels 
in the intervention group tended to improve, no other significant differences 
were observed in laboratory assessments between the groups.
CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence for the potential efficacy 
of a mobile application that integrates physical and mental health components to 
address depressive symptoms and enhance diabetes self-management in 
disadvantaged individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression. Further 
research involving larger and more diverse populations is warranted to validate 
these findings and solidify their implications.

Cancer patients experience various psychological and social difficulties, the 
most common being depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to 
develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an app-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy program for depression and anxiety in cancer patients. For this purpose, 
63 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either 
a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday), a 
simple information-provision mobile-application-based program (HARUCard), or a 
waitlist control group. Self-report questionnaires including the Beck Depression 
Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Health-Related Quality of Life Scale, 
Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and two computer tasks including the dot-probe 
task and the Implicit Association Test, were administered before and after 66 
days of intervention. The results showed that the Beck Depression Inventory and 
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores of the cognitive behavioral therapy program 
(HARUToday) group decreased significantly after the intervention compared to the 
attention control (HARUCard) and waitlist control groups. However, there were no 
significant changes in scores of the Health-Related Quality of Life Scale and 
Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and the two computer tasks. Such results suggest 
that a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program may be an 
effective intervention for alleviating depression and anxiety, but not the 
general quality of life of cancer patients. Taking into consideration that 
psychosocial problems may not the topmost priority for cancer patients who are 
facing a chronic and possibly mortal disease, a mobile-application cognitive 
behavioral therapy program may be a possible solution for the alleviation of 
depression and anxiety in cancer patients who have many restraints in terms of 
time and space.

BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and 
disability among American women. The prevalence of CHD is expected to increase 
by more than 40% by 2035. In 2015, the estimated cost of caring for patients 
with CHD was US $182 billion in the United States; hospitalizations accounted 
for more than half of the costs. Compared with men, women with CHD or those who 
have undergone coronary revascularization have up to 30% more rehospitalizations 
within 30 days and up to 1 year. Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is the gold 
standard of care after an acute coronary event, but few women attend these 
valuable programs. Effective home-based interventions for improving 
cardiovascular health among women with CHD are vital for addressing this gap in 
care.
OBJECTIVE: The ubiquity of mobile phones has made mobile health (mHealth) 
behavioral interventions a viable option to improve healthy behaviors of both 
women and men with CHD. First, this study aimed to examine the usability of a 
prototypic mHealth intervention designed specifically for women with CHD (herein 
referred to as HerBeat). Second, we examined the influence of HerBeat on 
selected health behaviors (self-efficacy for diet, exercise, and managing 
chronic illness) and psychological (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) 
characteristics of the participants.
METHODS: Using a single-group, pretest, posttest design, 10 women participated 
in the 12-week usability study. Participants were provided a smartphone and a 
smartwatch on which the HerBeat app was installed. Using a web portal dashboard, 
a health coach monitored participants' ecological momentary assessment data, 
their behavioral data, and their heart rate and step count. Participants then 
completed a 12-week follow-up assessment.
RESULTS: All 10 women (age: mean 64.4 years, SD 6.3 years) completed the study. 
The usability and acceptability of HerBeat were good, with a mean system 
usability score of 83.60 (SD 16.3). The participants demonstrated statistically 
significant improvements in waist circumference (P=.048), weight (P=.02), and 
BMI (P=.01). Furthermore, depressive symptoms, measured with the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9, significantly improved from baseline (P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth prototype was feasible and usable for women with CHD. 
Participants provided data that were useful for further development of HerBeat. 
The mHealth intervention is expected to help women with CHD self-manage their 
health behaviors. A randomized controlled trial is needed to further verify the 
findings.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent mental disorder, and is often co-occurring with 
depression and anxiety disorders. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia as 
treatment of choice for insomnia can also be applied digitally (digital 
cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia), making it more accessible. This is 
a secondary data analysis of a two-armed parallel randomized-controlled trial. 
In the primary publication, N = 238 participants meeting criteria for the 5th 
edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders chronic 
insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of digital cognitive 
behavioural therapy for insomnia + treatment-as-usual, or waitlist + 
treatment-as-usual. To determine the clinical effects of digital cognitive 
behavioural therapy for insomnia in populations with comorbid anxiety and 
depression symptoms, this secondary analysis focused on two subgroups: (1) 
participants with high initial depressive symptoms; and (2) participants with 
high initial anxiety symptoms. Symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety as 
primary outcome measures were obtained at baseline, 8 weeks post-randomization 
and, in the intervention group only, at 6- and 12-months follow-up. At 8 weeks 
post-randomization, the use of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for 
insomnia in both subgroups was associated with large reductions in insomnia 
severity in comparison to control (depression subgroup: d = 2.37; anxiety 
subgroup: d = 2.13). Between-group treatment effects were also observed for 
symptoms of depression in the depression subgroup (d = 1.59), and for symptoms 
of anxiety in the anxiety subgroup (d = 1.28). Within-group effects were stable 
over time (d = 0.64-1.63). This secondary analysis shows that digital cognitive 
behavioural therapy for insomnia reduces insomnia and comorbid symptoms in 
participants with high initial symptoms of either depression or anxiety with 
sustained long-term effects.

Digital health technologies for people with epilepsy (PWE) include 
internet-based resources and mobile apps for seizure management. Since 
non-pharmacological interventions, such as listening to specific Mozart's 
compositions, cognitive therapy, psychosocial and educational interventions were 
shown to reduce epileptic seizures, these modalities can be integrated into 
mobile software and delivered by mobile medical apps as digital therapeutics. 
Herein, we describe: (1) a survey study among PWE about preferences to use 
mobile software for seizure control, (2) a rationale for developing digital 
therapies for epilepsy, (3) creation of proof-of-concept mobile software 
intended for use as an adjunct digital therapeutic to reduce seizures, and (4) 
broader applications of digital therapeutics for the treatment of epilepsy and 
other chronic disorders. A questionnaire was used to survey PWE with respect to 
preferred features in a mobile app for seizure control. Results from the survey 
suggested that over 90% of responders would be interested in using a mobile app 
to manage their seizures, while 75% were interested in listening to specific 
music that can reduce seizures. To define digital therapeutic for the treatment 
of epilepsy, we designed and created a proof-of-concept mobile software 
providing digital content intended to reduce seizures. The rationale for all 
components of such digital therapeutic is described. The resulting web-based app 
delivered a combination of epilepsy self-care, behavioral interventions, 
medication reminders and the antiseizure music, such as the Mozart's sonata 
K.448. To improve long-term patient engagement, integration of mobile medical 
app with music and multimedia streaming via smartphones, tablets and computers 
is also discussed. This work aims toward development and regulatory clearance of 
software as medical device (SaMD) for seizure control, yielding the adjunct 
digital therapeutic for epilepsy, and subsequently a drug-device combination 
product together with specific antiseizure medications. Mobile medical apps, 
music, therapeutic video games and their combinations with prescription 
medications present new opportunities to integrate pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological interventions for PWE, as well as those living with other 
chronic disorders, including depression and pain.

BACKGROUND: Mobile apps may offer a valuable platform for delivering 
evidence-based psychological interventions for individuals with atypical 
appearances, or visible differences, who experience psychosocial appearance 
concerns such as appearance-based social anxiety and body dissatisfaction. 
Before this study, researchers and stakeholders collaboratively designed an app 
prototype based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), an evidence-based 
form of cognitive behavioral therapy that uses strategies such as mindfulness, 
clarification of personal values, and value-based goal setting. The intervention 
also included social skills training, an established approach for increasing 
individuals' confidence in managing social interactions, which evoke 
appearance-based anxiety for many.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors aim to evaluate the feasibility of an 
ACT-based app prototype via the primary objectives of user engagement and 
acceptability and the secondary feasibility objective of clinical safety and 
preliminary effectiveness.
METHODS: To address the feasibility objectives, the authors used a single-group 
intervention design with mixed methods in a group of 36 participants who have a 
range of visible differences. The authors collected quantitative data via 
measures of program use, satisfaction ratings, and changes over 3 time points 
spanning 12 weeks in outcomes, including selected ACT process measures 
(experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and valued action), scales of 
appearance concerns (appearance-based life disengagement, appearance-fixing 
behaviors, appearance self-evaluation, and fear of negative appearance 
evaluation), and clinical well-being (depression and anxiety). Semistructured 
exit interviews with a subsample of 12 participants provided qualitative data to 
give a more in-depth understanding of participants' views and experiences of the 
program.
RESULTS: In terms of user engagement, adherence rates over 6 sessions aligned 
with the upper boundary of those reported across mobile mental health apps, with 
over one-third of participants completing all sessions over 12 weeks, during 
which a steady decline in adherence was observed. Time spent on sessions matched 
design intentions, and engagement frequencies highlighted semiregular 
mindfulness practice, mixed use of value-based goal setting, and high engagement 
with social skills training. The findings indicate a good overall level of 
program acceptability via satisfaction ratings, and qualitative interview 
findings offer positive feedback as well as valuable directions for revisions. 
Overall, testing for clinical safety and potential effectiveness showed 
encouraging changes over time, including favorable changes in appearance-related 
life disengagement, appearance-fixing behaviors, and selected ACT measures. No 
iatrogenic effects were indicated for depression or anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: An ACT-based mobile program for individuals struggling with visible 
differences shows promising proof of concept in addressing appearance concerns, 
although further revisions and development are required before further 
development and more rigorous evaluation.

Technology-enabled services (TESs) are clinical interventions that combine 
technological and human components to provide health services. TESs for mental 
health are efficacious in the treatment of anxiety and depression and are 
currently being offered as frontline treatments around the world. It is hoped 
that these interventions will be able to reach diverse populations across a 
range of identities and ultimately decrease disparities in mental health 
treatment. However, this hope is largely unrealized. TESs include both 
technology and human service components, and we argue that cultural responsivity 
must be considered in each of these components to help address existing 
treatment disparities. To date, there is limited guidance on how to consider 
cultural responsivity within these interventions, including specific targets for 
the development, tailoring, or design of the technologies and services within 
TESs. In response, we propose a framework that provides specific recommendations 
for targets based on existing models, both at the technological component level 
(informed by the Behavioral Intervention Technology Model) and the human support 
level (informed by the Efficiency Model of Support). We hope that integrating 
culturally responsive considerations into these existing models will facilitate 
increased attention to cultural responsivity within TESs to ensure they are 
ethical and responsive for everyone.

While studies show links between smartphone data and affective symptoms, we lack 
clarity on the temporal scale, specificity (e.g., to depression vs. anxiety), 
and person-specific (vs. group-level) nature of these associations. We conducted 
a large-scale (n = 1013) smartphone-based passive sensing study to identify 
within- and between-person digital markers of depression and anxiety symptoms 
over time. Participants (74.6% female; M age = 40.9) downloaded the LifeSense 
app, which facilitated continuous passive data collection (e.g., GPS, app and 
device use, communication) across 16 weeks. Hierarchical linear regression 
models tested the within- and between-person associations of 2-week windows of 
passively sensed data with depression (PHQ-8) or generalized anxiety (GAD-7). We 
used a shifting window to understand the time scale at which sensed features 
relate to mental health symptoms, predicting symptoms 2 weeks in the future 
(distal prediction), 1 week in the future (medial prediction), and 0 weeks in 
the future (proximal prediction). Spending more time at home relative to one's 
average was an early signal of PHQ-8 severity (distal β = 0.219, p = 0.012) and 
continued to relate to PHQ-8 at medial (β = 0.198, p = 0.022) and proximal 
(β = 0.183, p = 0.045) windows. In contrast, circadian movement was proximally 
related to (β = -0.131, p = 0.035) but did not predict (distal β = 0.034, 
p = 0.577; medial β = -0.089, p = 0.138) PHQ-8. Distinct communication features 
(i.e., call/text or app-based messaging) related to PHQ-8 and GAD-7. Findings 
have implications for identifying novel treatment targets, personalizing digital 
mental health interventions, and enhancing traditional patient-provider 
interactions. Certain features (e.g., circadian movement) may represent 
correlates but not true prospective indicators of affective symptoms. 
Conversely, other features like home duration may be such early signals of 
intra-individual symptom change, indicating the potential utility of 
prophylactic intervention (e.g., behavioral activation) in response to 
person-specific increases in these signals.

This pilot study tested a single-session digital values affirmation for 
behavioral activation (VABA) intervention. Hypotheses predicted the VABA 
intervention would be more effective than an active control condition in 
improving mood, decreasing COVID-19 fear/worry and depressive symptoms, and 
promoting positively reinforcing behaviors during early weeks of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Participants were a diverse sample of undergraduate students (N = 296) 
under a state-wide lockdown. Students were randomized to either VABA, a 10-min 
values clarification and affirmation task, or Control, a time- and 
attention-matched task. Positive and negative affects were assessed pre- and 
post-intervention. At next-day follow-up, positive and negative affects were 
reassessed, as well as past 24-h behavioral activation and depressive symptoms. 
Within-group increases in positive affect were observed in both conditions (VABA 
d = 0.39; Control d = 0.19). However, VABA produced a significantly larger 
increase than Control (F[2] = 3.856, p = .022, d = 0.22). At 24-h follow-up, 
behavioral activation, which was significantly higher in VABA versus Control 
(t[294] = -5.584, p < .001, d = 0.65), predicted fewer depressive symptoms (R2 
change = .019, β = -.134, p = .003). VABA is an ultra-brief intervention that 
appears to have acute effects on mood-enhancement and behavioral activation.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are common in young people and have consequences 
for academic, social, emotional, and behavioral development. The most effective 
treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), with evidence 
suggesting that it is efficacious even when delivered digitally.
OBJECTIVE: There are no commercially available digitally delivered CBT-I 
programs for use by young people. The aim of this project was to develop a 
smartphone app that delivers CBT-I to young people to improve sleep.
METHODS: To inform the development of the app, young people (N=21) aged between 
12 and 16 years attended one of the 3 focus groups (each with 4-10 
participants). These focus groups were conducted at different stages of the 
development process such that the process could be iterative. Participants were 
asked the reasons why they might use an app to help them sleep, the kinds of 
features or functions that they would like to see in such an app, and any 
concerns they may have in using the app. Data were analyzed using a thematic 
analysis approach. Of the issues discussed by the participants, the researchers 
selected themes associated with content, functionality, and accessibility and 
user experience to examine, as these were most informative for the app design 
process.
RESULTS: In terms of content, young people were interested in receiving 
information about recommended sleep guidelines and personalized information for 
their age group. They reported that keeping a sleep diary was acceptable, but 
they should be able to complete it flexibly, in their own time. They reported 
mixed views about the use of the phone's accelerometer. Young people felt that 
the functionality of the app should include elements of game playing if they 
were to remain engaged with the app. Flexibility of use and personalized 
features were also desirable, and there were mixed views about the schedule of 
notifications and reminders. Participants reported that for the app to be 
accessible and usable, it should be from a trusted developer, have engaging 
aesthetics, have a layout that is easy to navigate, not rely on Internet 
coverage, and preferably be free. Participants felt that being able to conceal 
the purpose of the app from peers was an advantage and were willing to provide 
personal information to use the app if the purpose and use of that information 
was made clear. Overall, participants endorsed the use of the app for sleep 
problems among their age group and reported motivation to use it.
CONCLUSIONS: The Sleep Ninja is a fully-automated app that delivers CBT-I to 
young people, incorporating the features and information that young people 
reported they would expect from this app. A pilot study testing the feasibility, 
acceptability, and efficacy of the Sleep Ninja is now underway.

The comorbidity of depression with physical chronic diseases is usually not 
considered in clinical guidelines. This study evaluated the feasibility of a 
technology-assisted collaborative care (TCC) program for depression in people 
with diabetes and/or high blood pressure (DM/HBP) attending a primary health 
care (PHC) facility in Santiago, Chile. Twenty people diagnosed with DM/HBP 
having a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 15 points were recruited. The 
TCC program consisted of a face-to-face, computer-assisted psychosocial 
intervention (CPI, five biweekly sessions), telephone monitoring (TM), and a 
mobile phone application for behavioral activation (CONEMO). Assessments of 
depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes were made. Thirteen 
patients completed the CAPI, 12 received TM, and none tried CONEMO. The TCC 
program was potentially efficacious in treating depression, with two-thirds of 
participants achieving response to depression treatment 12 weeks after baseline. 
Decreases were observed in depressive symptoms and healthcare visits and 
increases in mental health-related quality of life and adherence to treatment. 
Patients perceived the CPI as acceptable. The TCC program was partially feasible 
and potentially efficacious for managing depression in people with DM/HBP. These 
data are valuable inputs for a future randomized clinical trial.

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Mobile app-based 
behavior change interventions that promote lifestyle physical activity (PA) may 
serve as viable alternatives or adjuncts to traditional treatments offering 
increased reach and accessibility. This protocol describes an experimental, 
pre-post single-arm trial to investigate the feasibility and preliminary effects 
of an app-based, 9-week PA intervention (MoodMover) designed for individuals 
with depression. MoodMover is co-designed with patients and a multidisciplinary 
research team using a no-code intervention development platform (Pathverse). 
This study will employ a single-arm pre-post trial with an optional 9-week 
follow-up, following the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) 
model. Thirty-six adults who self-report a clinical diagnosis of major 
depressive disorder or report at least mild depressive symptoms based on the 
Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items (PHQ-9) will be recruited. The main 
outcomes of this study are the feasibility and acceptability of MoodMover, such 
as the recruitment strategy, assessments (e.g., PHQ-9), and user engagement. 
Preliminary effects will be assessed by evaluating changes in PA and depressive 
symptoms. Recruitment is expected to begin on November 1st, 2024, and end on May 
1st, 2025. Trial results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed 
journals and via presentations at academic conferences. This study fits within 
Phase IIa: Proof-of-concept and Phase IIb: Pilot and Preliminary Testing of the 
ORBIT model. The robust feasibility and acceptability measures, especially the 
user engagement data powered by Pathverse, will provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the MoodMover intervention's feasibility and potential effects. 
Results will inform potential progression to the next step of the ORBIT 
model-Phase IIc: Phase II Efficacy Trial-to test MoodMover in a more rigorous 
randomized controlled trial. This study has been registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06573125; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06573125).

BACKGROUND: Loneliness is commonly reported by young people and has been shown 
to contribute to the rapid onset and escalation of depression and suicidal 
ideation during adolescence. Lonely people may also be particularly susceptible 
to disengaging from treatment early given the likelihood of their more complex 
clinical profiles leading to cognitive fatigue. While a smartphone intervention 
(LifeBuoy) has been shown to effectively reduce suicidal ideation in young 
adults, poor engagement is a well-documented issue for this therapeutic modality 
and has been shown to result in poorer treatment outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether loneliness affects how young 
people experiencing suicidal ideation engage with and benefit from a therapeutic 
smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy).
METHODS: A total of 455 community-based Australian young adults (aged 18-25 
years) experiencing recent suicidal ideation were randomized to use a 
dialectical behavioral therapy-based smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy) or an 
attention-matched control app (LifeBuoy-C) for 6 weeks. Participants completed 
measures of suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and loneliness at baseline 
(T0), post intervention (T1), and 3 months post intervention (T2). Piecewise 
linear mixed models were used to examine whether loneliness levels moderated the 
effect of LifeBuoy and LifeBuoy-C on suicidal ideation and depression across 
time (T0 to T1; T1 to T2). This statistical method was then used to examine 
whether app engagement (number of modules completed) influenced the relationship 
between baseline loneliness and suicidal ideation and depression across time.
RESULTS: Loneliness was positively associated with higher levels of overall 
suicidal ideation (B=0.75, 95% CI 0.08-1.42; P=.03) and depression (B=0.88, 95% 
CI 0.45-1.32; P<.001), regardless of time point or allocated condition. However, 
loneliness did not affect suicidal ideation scores across time (time 1: B=1.10, 
95% CI -0.25 to 2.46; P=.11; time 2: B=0.43, 95% CI -1.25 to 2.12; P=.61) and 
depression scores across time (time 1: B=0.00, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.66; P=.99; time 
2: B=0.41, 95% CI -0.37 to 1.18; P=.30) in either condition. Similarly, 
engagement with the LifeBuoy app was not found to moderate the impact of 
loneliness on suicidal ideation (B=0.00, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.18; P=.98) or 
depression (B=-0.08, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.03; P=.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was not found to affect young adults' engagement with a 
smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy) nor any clinical benefits derived from the 
intervention. LifeBuoy, in its current form, can effectively engage and treat 
individuals regardless of how lonely they may be.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia in adolescents is common, persistent, and associated with 
poor mental health including anxiety and depression. Insomnia in adolescents 
attending child mental health services is seldom directly treated, and the 
effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia (CBTi) on the 
mental health of adolescents with significant mental health problems are 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This open study aimed to assess the feasibility of adding supported 
Web-based CBT for insomnia to the usual care of young people aged 14 to 17 years 
attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).
METHODS: A total of 39 adolescents with insomnia aged 14 to 17 years attending 
specialist CAMHS were assessed and offered digital CBTi. The digital 
intervention was Sleepio, an evidence-based, self-directed, fully automated CBTi 
that has proven effective in multiple randomized controlled trials with adults. 
Self-report assessments of sleep (Sleep Condition Indicator [SCI], Insomnia 
Severity Scale, and Web- or app-based sleep diaries), anxiety (Revised Child 
Anxiety and Depression Scale [RCADS]), and depression (Mood and Feelings 
Questionnaire [MFQ]) were completed at baseline and post intervention. Postuse 
interviews assessed satisfaction with digital CBTi.
RESULTS: Average baseline sleep efficiency was very poor (53%), with 
participants spending an average of 9.6 hours in bed but only 5.1 hours asleep. 
All participants scored less than 17 on the SCI, with 92% (36/39) participants 
scoring 15 or greater on the Insomnia Severity Scale, suggesting clinical 
insomnia. Of the 39 participants, 36 (92%) scored 27 or greater on the MFQ for 
major depression and 20 (51%) had clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety. The 
majority of participants (38/49, 78%) were not having any treatment for their 
insomnia, with the remaining 25% (12/49) receiving medication. Sleepio was 
acceptable, with 77% (30/39) of the participants activating their account and 
54% (21/39) completing the program. Satisfaction was high, with 84% (16/19) of 
the participants finding Sleepio helpful, 95% (18/19) indicating that they would 
recommend it to a friend, and 37% (7/19) expressing a definite preference for a 
digital intervention. Statistically significant pre-post improvements were found 
in weekly diaries of sleep efficiency (P=.005) and sleep quality (P=.001) and on 
measures of sleep (SCI: P=.001 and Insomnia Severity Index: P=.001), low mood 
(MFQ: P=.03), and anxiety (RCADS: P=.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has a number of methodological limitations, particularly 
the small sample size, absence of a comparison group and no follow-up 
assessment. Nonetheless, our findings are encouraging and suggest that digital 
CBTi for young people with mental health problems might offer an acceptable and 
an effective way to improve both sleep and mental health.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is frequently used to treat 
depressive symptoms in people living with HIV. We developed an internet-based 
cognitive behavioral intervention for people with HIV and depressive symptoms, 
which was based on an effective self-help booklet. The Web-based intervention 
was previously found to be effective.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate potential mediators of 
the Web-based intervention.
METHODS: This study was part of a randomized controlled trial, in which the 
intervention was compared with an attention-only waiting list control condition. 
Participants were 188 (97 in intervention group and 91 in control group) people 
with HIV and mild to moderate depressive symptoms recruited in HIV treatment 
centers in the Netherlands. A total of 22 participants (22/188, 11.7%) in the 
study were female and 166 (166/188, 88.3%) were male. The average age of the 
participants was 46.30 years (SD 10.63). The intervention comprised Web-based 
self-help CBT for 8 weeks, 1 to 2 hours a week, including minimal telephone 
support from a coach. The participants received Web-based questionnaires at 
pretest, 3 times during the intervention/or waiting period, and post 
intervention. The outcome was depressive symptoms. Factors tested as potential 
mediators were changes in behavioral activation, relaxation, the cognitive 
coping strategies catastrophizing and positive refocusing, goal re-engagement, 
and coping self-efficacy.
RESULTS: Using multilevel structural equation modeling, changes in behavioral 
activation (P=.006) and goal re-engagement (P=.009) were found to be significant 
mediators of the intervention effect. The mediation effect seemed to occur 
between weeks 3 and 5 for behavioral activation and weeks 1 and 3 for goal 
re-engagement. Using (bivariate) autoregressive latent trajectory analysis, we 
found a return effect (from the dependent variable to the mediator) for goal 
re-engagement but not for behavioral activation, which suggested that the 
mediation effect of changes in behavioral activation was stronger than that in 
goal re-engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that changes in behavioral activation and goal 
re-engagement may mediate the effect of the Web-based intervention for people 
with HIV and depressive symptoms. The results may lead to possible mechanisms of 
change of the intervention and improvement of therapy outcomes.

Understanding why therapists deviate from a treatment manual is crucial to 
interpret the mixed findings on the adherence-outcome association. The current 
study aims to examine whether therapists' interpersonal behaviours and patients' 
active engagement predict treatment outcome and therapist adherence in cognitive 
behaviour therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for 
depressive symptoms. In addition, the study explores rater's explanations for 
therapist nonadherence at sessions in which therapist adherence was low. Study 
participants were 61 patients with diabetes and depressive symptoms who were 
randomized to either CBT or MBCT. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II. Therapist adherence, therapist interpersonal skills 
(i.e., empathy, warmth, and involvement), patients' active engagement, and 
reasons for nonadherence were assessed by two independent raters (based on 
digital video recordings). Therapist adherence, therapists' interpersonal 
skills, and patients' active engagement did not predict posttreatment depressive 
symptom reduction. Patients' active engagement was positively associated with 
therapist adherence in CBT and in MBCT. This indicates that adherence may be 
hampered when patients are not actively engaged in treatment. Observed reasons 
for nonadherence mostly covered responses to patient's in-session behaviour. The 
variety of reasons for therapist nonadherence might explain why therapist 
adherence was not associated with outcomes of CBT and MBCT.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many cancer survivors who received intensive treatment such as 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) experience posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) symptoms. PTSD is associated with lower quality of life and 
other symptoms that require clinical treatment. The iterative treatment 
decisions that happen in clinical practice are not adequately represented in 
traditional randomized controlled trials (RCT) of PTSD treatments. The proposed 
stepped-care SMART design allows for evaluation of initial response to the 
Cancer Distress Coach mobile app; adaptive stepped-care interventions; and 
precision treatment strategies that tailor treatment selection to patient 
characteristics.
METHODS/DESIGN: HCT survivors (N = 400) reporting PTSD symptoms are being 
recruited at two cancer centers and randomly assigned to: 1) Cancer Distress 
Coach app or 2) Usual Care. The app includes educational and cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT)-based activities. Four weeks post-randomization, 
participants re-rate their PTSD symptoms and, based on intervention response, 
non-responders are re-randomized to receive video-conferenced sessions with a 
therapist: 3) coaching sessions in using the mobile app; or 4) CBT specific to 
HCT survivors. Participants complete outcome measures of PTSD, depression, and 
anxiety after Months 1, 3, and 6. Participant characteristics moderating 
intervention responses will be examined.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel adaptive trial design will afford evidence that furthers 
knowledge about optimizing PTSD interventions for HCT survivors. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first SMART design evaluating PTSD symptom 
management in cancer survivors. If successful, it could be used to optimize 
treatment among a range of cancer and other trauma survivors.

BACKGROUND: This study assessed the effectiveness of the NEVERMIND e-health 
system, consisting of a smart shirt and a mobile application with lifestyle 
behavioural advice, mindfulness-based therapy, and cognitive behavioural 
therapy, in reducing depressive symptoms among patients diagnosed with severe 
somatic conditions. Our hypothesis was that the system would significantly 
decrease the level of depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared to 
the control group.
METHODS: This pragmatic, randomised controlled trial included 425 patients 
diagnosed with myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney 
failure, or lower limb amputation. Participants were recruited from hospitals in 
Turin and Pisa (Italy), and Lisbon (Portugal), and were randomly assigned to 
either the NEVERMIND intervention or to the control group. Clinical interviews 
and structured questionnaires were administered at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 
weeks. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms at 12 weeks measured by the 
Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Intention-to-treat analyses included 425 
participants, while the per-protocol analyses included 333 participants. This 
trial is registered in the German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00013391.
FINDINGS: Patients were recruited between Dec 4, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019, with 
213 assigned to the intervention and 212 to the control group. The sample had a 
mean age of 59·41 years (SD=10·70), with 44·24% women. Those who used the 
NEVERMIND system had statistically significant lower depressive symptoms at the 
12-week follow-up (mean difference=-3·03, p<0·001; 95% CI -4·45 to -1·62) 
compared with controls, with a clinically relevant effect size (Cohen's d=0·39).
INTERPRETATION: The results of this study show that the NEVERMIND system is 
superior to standard care in reducing and preventing depressive symptoms among 
patients with the studied somatic conditions.
FUNDING: The NEVERMIND project received funding from the European Union's 
Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 689691.

BACKGROUND: Current psychiatric epidemiological evidence estimates that 17% of 
young adults (aged 18-25 years) experienced a major depressive episode in 2020, 
relative to 8.4% of all adults aged ≥26 years. Young adults with a major 
depressive episode in the past year are the least likely to receive treatment 
for depression compared with other age groups.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized clinical trial following our initial 4-week 
SMS text message-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-txt) for depression 
in young adults. We sought to test mechanisms of change for CBT-txt.
METHODS: Based on participant feedback, outcome data, and the empirical 
literature, we increased the treatment dosage from 4-8 weeks and tested 3 
mechanisms of change with 103 young adults in the United States. Participants 
were from 34 states, recruited from Facebook and Instagram and presenting with 
at least moderate depressive symptomatology. Web-based assessments occurred at 
baseline prior to randomization and at 1, 2, and 3 months after enrollment. The 
primary outcome, the severity of depressive symptoms, was assessed using the 
Beck Depression Inventory II. Behavioral activation, perseverative thinking, and 
cognitive distortions were measured as mechanisms of change. Participants were 
randomized to CBT-txt or a waitlist control condition. Those assigned to the 
CBT-txt intervention condition received 474 fully automated SMS text messages, 
delivered every other day over a 64-day period and averaging 14.8 (SD 2.4) SMS 
text messages per treatment day. Intervention texts are delivered via TextIt, a 
web-based automated SMS text messaging platform.
RESULTS: Across all 3 months of the study, participants in the CBT-txt group 
showed significantly larger decreases in depressive symptoms than those in the 
control group (P<.001 at each follow-up), producing a medium-to-large effect 
size (Cohen d=0.76). Over half (25/47, 53%) of the treatment group moved into 
the "high-end functioning" category, representing no or minimal clinically 
significant depressive symptoms, compared with 15% (8/53) of the control 
condition. Mediation analysis showed that CBT-txt appeared to lead to greater 
increases in behavioral activation and greater decreases in cognitive 
distortions and perseverative thinking across the 3-month follow-up period, 
which were then associated with larger baseline to 3-month decreases in 
depression. The size of the indirect effects was substantial: 57%, 41%, and 50% 
of the CBT-txt effect on changes in depression were mediated by changes in 
behavioral activation, cognitive distortions, and perseverative thinking, 
respectively. Models including all 3 mediators simultaneously showed that 63% of 
the CBT-txt effect was mediated by the combined indirect effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the efficacy of CBT-txt to reduce 
young adult depressive symptoms through hypothesized mechanisms. To the best of 
our knowledge, CBT-txt is unique in its SMS text message-delivered modality, the 
strong clinical evidence supporting efficacy and mechanisms of change.

BACKGROUND: Unipolar and bipolar disorder combined account for nearly half of 
all morbidity and mortality due to mental and substance use disorders, and 
burden society with the highest health care costs of all psychiatric and 
neurological disorders. Among these, costs due to psychiatric hospitalization 
are a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique platform for 
the monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. No prior trial has 
investigated whether the use of a smartphone-based system can prevent 
re-admission among patients discharged from hospital. The present RADMIS trials 
aim to investigate whether using a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment 
system, including an integrated clinical feedback loop, reduces the rate and 
duration of re-admissions more than standard treatment in unipolar disorder and 
bipolar disorder.
METHODS: The RADMIS trials use a randomized controlled, single-blind, 
parallel-group design. Patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar 
disorder are invited to participate in each trial when discharged from 
psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region of Denmark following an affective 
episode and randomized to either (1) a smartphone-based monitoring system 
including (a) an integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians and 
(b) context-aware cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules (intervention 
group) or (2) standard treatment (control group) for a 6-month trial period. The 
trial started in May 2017. The outcomes are (1) number and duration of 
re-admissions (primary), (2) severity of depressive and manic (only for patients 
with bipolar disorder) symptoms; psychosocial functioning; number of affective 
episodes (secondary), and (3) perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated 
depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms (only for patients with bipolar 
disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, wellbeing, 
ruminations, worrying, and satisfaction (tertiary). A total of 400 patients (200 
patients with unipolar disorder and 200 patients with bipolar disorder) will be 
included in the RADMIS trials.
DISCUSSION: If the smartphone-based monitoring system proves effective in 
reducing the rate and duration of re-admissions, there will be basis for using a 
system of this kind in the treatment of unipolar and bipolar disorder in general 
and on a larger scale.

BACKGROUND: Translation of knowledge and skills from classroom settings to 
clinical practice is a major challenge in healthcare training, especially for 
behavioral interventions. For example, screening, brief intervention, and 
referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a highly-promoted approach to identifying and 
treating individuals at risk for alcohol or drug problems, yet effective, 
routine use of SBIRT has lagged.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the development, pilot 
testing, and trial protocol of a mobile app based on the theory of planned 
behavior (TPB) to promote SBIRT skill translation and application.
METHODS: Intended for use after classroom training occurs, the mobile app has 
three primary functions designed to increase behavioral intent to deliver SBIRT: 
(1) review skills (ie, address knowledge and beliefs about SBIRT), (2) apply 
skills with patients (ie, build confidence and perceived behavioral control), 
and (3) report performance data (ie, increase accountability and social norms 
and/or influence). The app includes depression and anxiety screening tools due 
to high comorbidity with substance use. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is 
in progress among health and social service learners (N=200) recruited from 3 
universities and 6 different training programs in nursing, social work, internal 
medicine, psychiatry, and psychology. Participants are randomized to SBIRT 
classroom instruction alone or classroom instruction plus app access prior to 
beginning their field placement rotations. TPB-based data are collected via 
Qualtrics or via the mobile app pre-post and SBIRT utilization, weekly for 10 
weeks. Key outcomes include the frequency of and self-reported confidence in 
delivery of SBIRT.
RESULTS: Beta testing with advanced practice nursing students (N=22) indicated 
that the app and its associated assessment tools were acceptable and useful. The 
system usability scale (SUS) mean was 65.8 (n=19), which indicated that the 
SBIRT app was acceptable but could benefit from improvement. Indeed, 
modifications were implemented prior to starting the trial. Enrollment of trial 
participants began in September 2016. Results are expected by December 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the process of TPB-based app development and 
testing, and the protocol for a RCT to determine the effectiveness of the app in 
enhancing skill translation. If effective, this approach could improve SBIRT 
implementation, fidelity, and clinical outcomes.

The majority of children with physical disabilities experience significant 
restrictions in their daily lives. Notably, they are at a risk for lower levels 
of activity and involvement in critical life domains. To address this issue, 
this study investigated whether behavioral activation (BA), in tandem with the 
installment of power-assisted devices (PAD), would have beneficial effects on 
activity levels, overall involvement in life domains, mobility, and depressive 
symptoms among children with physical disabilities. From among 123 children with 
physical disabilities aged 6-13 who used a nonpowered wheelchair device, 40 who 
met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized into either the 
PAD-only group or the BA + PAD group. The participants were assessed at 3 time 
periods (pretreatment, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks), using standardized self-report 
measures and digital odometers. Both groups showed an increase in the distance 
traveled. Although BA + PAD had no additional benefits over PAD-only in 
improving the distance traveled and depressive symptoms, the BA + PAD group 
showed significantly higher levels of activity and overall involvement in life 
domains than the PAD-only group did. The findings provide preliminary support 
for the provision of BA for children with physical disabilities. (PsycInfo

BACKGROUND: Depression is the most prevalent mental health condition in older 
adults. However, not all evidence-based treatments are easily accessible. 
Web-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (wCBT) facilitated by laypersons is a 
viable treatment alternative.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a 
novel wCBT program, Empower@Home, supported by trained lay coaches, against a 
waitlist attention control. Empower@Home is among the very few existing wCBT 
programs specifically designed for older adults. The primary objective was to 
assess the efficacy of the intervention compared with attention control. The 
secondary objective was to evaluate the program's impact on secondary 
psychosocial outcomes and explore potential change mechanisms.
METHODS: Older adults (N=70) were recruited via web-based research registries, 
social media advertisements, and community agency referrals and randomly 
assigned to either the intervention or control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. 
The intervention group received access to Empower@Home, which included 9 
web-delivered self-help lessons and weekly telephone coaching sessions by a 
trained layperson over 10 weeks. The control group received weekly friendly 
phone calls and depressive symptom monitoring. The primary clinical outcome was 
the severity of depressive symptoms assessed using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9. The secondary clinical outcomes included anxiety, anger, social 
isolation, insomnia, pain intensity, and quality of life. Linear mixed modeling 
was used to determine the treatment effects on depression, and 2-tailed t tests 
were used to assess within-group changes and between-group differences.
RESULTS: Most participants in the intervention group completed all 9 sessions 
(31/35, 89%). The usability and acceptability ratings were excellent. The 
intervention group had a large within-group change in depressive symptoms (Cohen 
d=1.22; P<.001), whereas the attention control group experienced a medium change 
(Cohen d=0.57; P<.001). The between-group effect size was significant, favoring 
the intervention group over the control group (Cohen d=0.72; P<.001). In the 
linear mixed model, the group-by-time interaction was statistically significant 
(b=-0.68, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.35; P<.001). The treatment effects were mediated by 
improvements in cognitive behavioral therapy skills acquisition; behavioral 
activation; and satisfaction with the basic psychological needs of autonomy, 
competence, and relatedness. Furthermore, the intervention group showed 
significant within-group improvements in secondary psychosocial outcomes, 
including anxiety (P=.001), anger (P<.001), social isolation (P=.02), insomnia 
(P=.007), and pain (P=.03). By contrast, the control group did not experience 
significant changes in these outcome domains. However, the between-group 
differences in secondary outcomes were not statistically significant, owing to 
the small sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: Empower@Home, a wCBT program supported by lay coaches, was more 
efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms than friendly telephone calls and 
depression symptom monitoring. Future studies should examine the effectiveness 
of the intervention in community and practice settings using nonclinician staff 
already present in these real-world settings as coaches.

BACKGROUND: Blended group therapy combines group sessions with Web- and 
mobile-based treatment modules. Consequently, blended group therapy widens the 
choice within blended interventions at reasonable costs. This is the first 
qualitative study on blended group therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the patient-centered 
feasibility of blended group therapy for major depression, with special emphasis 
on the fit and dynamic interplay between face-to-face and internet-based 
elements.
METHODS: A total of 22 patients who had a variety of experiences through 
participating in one of the two blended group therapy interventions were 
interviewed following a semistructured interview guide. In-depth interviews were 
analyzed by three trained psychologists, using thematic analysis and a 
rule-guided internet-based program (QCAmap). The transcript of the interviews 
(113,555 words) was reduced to 1081 coded units, with subsequent extraction of 
16 themes.
RESULTS: Web- and mobile-based elements were described as a treatment 
facilitator and motivator, increasing the salience and consolidation of 
cognitive behavioral therapy materials, resulting in in- and inter-session 
alignment to the treatment. Additionally, patients valued the option of intimate 
Web-based self-disclosure (by lateral patient-therapist communication), and 
therapists were provided with tools for between-session monitoring and 
reinforcement of exercising. In this context, group phenomena seemed to back up 
therapists' efforts to increase treatment engagement. The dissonance because of 
noncompliance with Web-based tasks and the constriction of in-session group 
interaction were considered as possible negative effects. Finally, issues of 
tailoring and structure seemed to fulfill different preconditions compared with 
individual therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Blended group therapy constitutes a structured and proactive 
approach to work with depression, and the integration of both modalities 
initiates a beneficial interplay. Results support the patient-centered value of 
blended group therapy and provide the first insight into blended group therapy's 
role in fostering therapeutic treatment factors. However, potential negative 
effects should be considered carefully.

BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for scalable psychological treatments to 
address adolescent depression in low-resource settings. Digital mental health 
interventions have many potential advantages, but few have been specifically 
designed for or rigorously evaluated with adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: This study had 2 main objectives. The first was to describe the 
user-centered development of a smartphone app that delivers behavioral 
activation (BA) to treat depression among adolescents in rural South Africa and 
Uganda. The second was to summarize the findings from multicycle usability 
testing.
METHODS: An iterative user-centered agile design approach was used to co-design 
the app to ensure that it was engaging, culturally relevant, and usable for the 
target populations. An array of qualitative methods, including focus group 
discussions, in-depth individual interviews, participatory workshops, usability 
testing, and extensive expert consultation, was used to iteratively refine the 
app throughout each phase of development.
RESULTS: A total of 160 adolescents from rural South Africa and Uganda were 
involved in the development process. The app was built to be consistent with the 
principles of BA and supported by brief weekly phone calls from peer mentors who 
would help users overcome barriers to engagement. Drawing on the findings of the 
formative work, we applied a narrative game format to develop the Kuamsha app. 
This approach taught the principles of BA using storytelling techniques and game 
design elements. The stories were developed collaboratively with adolescents 
from the study sites and included decision points that allowed users to shape 
the narrative, character personalization, in-app points, and notifications. Each 
story consists of 6 modules ("episodes") played in sequential order, and each 
covers different BA skills. Between modules, users were encouraged to work on 
weekly activities and report on their progress and mood as they completed these 
activities. The results of the multicycle usability testing showed that the 
Kuamsha app was acceptable in terms of usability and engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: The Kuamsha app uniquely delivered BA for adolescent depression via 
an interactive narrative game format tailored to the South African and Ugandan 
contexts. Further studies are currently underway to examine the intervention's 
feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms.

Depressive symptoms are the most frequently treated psychiatric condition in the 
United States. Brief behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD) is a 
popular, evidence-based psychotherapy with strong research support for the 
treatment of depression. In this paper, we describe the development and initial 
pilot feasibility testing of a BATD mobile application (Behavioral Apptivation) 
to be used by patients and therapists in conjunction with BATD therapy. We 
present information regarding the app development process as well as results 
from a small open-label feasibility trial of the app utilized in conjunction 
with individual BATD. We include a case series from the open-label trial 
highlighting how Behavioral Apptivation can be utilized in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: There are far more patients in mental distress than there is time 
available for mental health professionals to support them. Although digital 
tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological 
solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance 
from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions' efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT)-based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels 
that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including 
face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use 
a conversational agent.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze 
aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, 
fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 
2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short 
Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the 
conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in 
scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews.
RESULTS: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. 
Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of 
participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 
1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for 
depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score 
was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was 
comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, 
outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 
3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores 
(r=-0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression 
had high bond scores of 3.45.
CONCLUSIONS: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of 
human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital 
therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future 
research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, 
since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have 
major public health benefits.

BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are the leading cause of disability among 
adolescents worldwide, yet access to treatment is limited. Brief digital 
interventions have been shown to improve youth mental health, but little is 
known about which digital interventions are most effective.
AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of two digital single-session interventions 
(Shamiri-Digital and Digital-CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy)) among Kenyan 
adolescents.
METHODS: We will perform a school-based comparative effectiveness randomised 
controlled trial. Approximately 926 Kenyan adolescents will be randomly assigned 
to one of three conditions: Shamiri-Digital (focused on gratitude, growth 
mindsets and values), Digital-CBT (focused on behavioural activation, cognitive 
restructuring and problem solving) or a study-skills control condition (focused 
on note-taking and essay writing skills). The primary outcomes include 
depressive symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety 
symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7) and subjective well-being 
(Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes 
include acceptability, appropriateness, primary control and secondary control. 
Acceptability and appropriateness will be measured immediately 
post-intervention; other outcomes will be measured 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks 
post-intervention.
RESULTS: We hypothesise that adolescents assigned to Shamiri-Digital and 
adolescents assigned to Digital-CBT will experience greater improvements 
(assessed via hierarchical linear models) than those assigned to the control 
group. We will also compare Shamiri-Digital with Digital-CBT, although we do not 
have a preplanned hypothesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help us evaluate two digital single-session 
interventions with different theoretical foundations. If effective, such 
interventions could be disseminated to reduce the public health burden of common 
mental health problems.

Although behavioral therapies are effective for posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), access for patients is limited. Attention-bias modification (ABM), a 
cognitive-training intervention designed to reduce attention bias for threat, 
can be broadly disseminated using technology. We remotely tested an ABM mobile 
app for PTSD. Participants (N = 689) were randomly assigned to personalized ABM, 
nonpersonalized ABM, or placebo training. ABM was a modified dot-probe paradigm 
delivered daily for 12 sessions. Personalized ABM included words selected using 
a recommender algorithm. Placebo included only neutral words. Primary outcomes 
(PTSD and anxiety) and secondary outcomes (depression and PTSD clusters) were 
collected at baseline, after training, and at 5-week-follow-up. Mechanisms 
assessed during treatment were attention bias and self-reported threat 
sensitivity. No group differences emerged on outcomes or attention bias. 
Nonpersonalized ABM showed greater declines in self-reported threat sensitivity 
than placebo (p = .044). This study constitutes the largest mobile-based trial 
of ABM to date. Findings do not support the effectiveness of mobile ABM for 
PTSD.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading cause of disability in adolescents, however 
few receive evidence-based treatment. Despite having the potential to overcome 
barriers to treatment uptake and adherence, there are very few CBT-based 
smartphone apps for adolescents. To address this gap, we developed ClearlyMe®, a 
self-guided CBT smartphone app for adolescent depression and anxiety. ClearlyMe® 
consists of 37 brief lessons containing core CBT elements, accessed either 
individually or as part of a 'collection'. Here, we describe the protocol for a 
randomised controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of ClearlyMe® on 
depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes, including engagement, anxiety and 
wellbeing, when delivered with and without guided support compared to an 
attention matched control.
METHODS: We aim to recruit 489 adolescents aged 12-17 years with mild to 
moderately-severe depressive symptoms. Participants will be screened for 
inclusion, complete the baseline assessment and are then randomly allocated to 
receive ClearlyMe® (self-directed use), ClearlyMe® with guided SMS support 
(guided use) or digital psychoeducation (attention-matched control). Depressive 
symptoms and secondary outcomes will be assessed at 6-weeks (primary endpoint) 
and 4-months post-baseline (secondary endpoint). Engagement, conceptualised as 
uptake, adherence and completion, will also be assessed 6-weeks post-baseline. 
Mixed-effects linear modelling will be used to conduct intention-to-treat 
analyses to determine whether reductions in depressive symptoms and secondary 
outcomes are greater for conditions receiving ClearlyMe® relative to control at 
6-weeks and 4-months post-baseline and greater for intervention adherers 
relative to non-adherers. To minimise risk, participants will be encouraged to 
use the Get Help section of the app and can also opt to receive a call from the 
team clinical psychologist at baseline, and at the 6-week and 4-month 
post-baseline assessments when reporting suicidal ideation.
DISCUSSION: This is the first clinical trial examining a CBT smartphone app 
specifically designed for adolescent depression. It will provide empirical 
evidence on the effects of ClearlyMe® on depressive symptoms when used with and 
without guided support.

Background: Chinese young adults experience barriers to mental health treatment, 
including the lack of treatment providers and stigma around treatment seeking. 
Evidence-based digital mental health interventions are promising and scalable 
alternatives to face-to-face treatment for this population, but lack rigorous 
evidence to support scale-up in China. Aim: The study was a feasibility study 
for a large-scale RCT of Step-by-Step, a behavioral activation-based, mental 
health intervention to address depression and anxiety symptoms in Chinese young 
adults. It sought to assess feasibility of recruitment and of delivery of 
Step-by-Step in a University setting, to assess acceptability of the 
intervention, and to examine potential effectiveness. Method: An uncontrolled, 
feasibility trial was conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of 
Chinese Step-by-Step for Chinese University students with elevated depressive 
symptoms (PHQ-9 scores at or above 10) in Macao, China. Data was collected at 
two different time points (i.e., baseline and 8-weeks after baseline), 
administered via questionnaires embedded in an interventional mobile 
application. Participation rate and dropout rate were measured. Depressive and 
anxiety symptom severity, well-being, and self-defined stress were assessed. 
Satisfaction with the program was assessed using qualitative interviews. 
Results: A total of 173 students were screened, 22.0% (n = 38) were eligible, 
and 63.2% of them (n = 24) started the intervention. The dropout rate by 
post-test was 45.8%. Results from completers showed that Step-by-Step was 
potentially effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptom severity, and 
self-defined stress. Students were generally satisfied with the program, but 
also offered suggestions for continued improvement. Qualitative feedback was 
reported within the RE-AIM framework, covering recruitment, effectiveness, 
adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Amendments to the program were made 
according to the feedback (e.g., adding notification for new session, modify the 
time zone). Conclusion: A minimally guided Step-by-Step protocol and the study 
procedure were successfully pilot tested for use for Chinese University 
students. The intervention was acceptable and no adverse events were reported. 
The results support the potential effectiveness and feasibility of a large-scale 
evaluation of the program.

BACKGROUND: Tackling poor mental health in university students has been 
identified as a priority in higher education. However, there are few 
evidence-based prevention initiatives designed for students. Repetitive Negative 
Thought (RNT, e.g. worry, rumination) is elevated in university students and is 
a well-established vulnerability factor for anxiety and depression. Furthermore, 
there are now evidence-based cognitive-behavioural interventions to tackle RNT. 
A mobile self-help cognitive-behavioural app targeting RNT, adapted for students 
may therefore be an effective, scalable, and acceptable way to improve 
prevention in students.
METHODS: An online single blind, two-arm parallel-group Randomised Controlled 
Trial (RCT) to examine the incidence of major depression and symptoms of anxiety 
and depression across 12 months in university students aged over 16 who screen 
into the study with self-reported high levels of worry and/or rumination and no 
current diagnosis of major depression. Eligible participants will be randomised 
to the active intervention arm (usual practice plus using a self-guided mobile 
app targeting RNT) or to the control arm (usual practice). In total, 648 
participants aged over 16, with no current major depression, bipolar disorder or 
psychosis will be recruited from UK universities. Assessments will take place at 
baseline (pre-randomisation), 3 months and 12 months post- randomisation. 
Primary endpoint and outcome is incidence of major depression as determined by 
self-reported diagnostic criteria at 12-month follow-up. Depressive symptoms, 
anxiety, well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and academic 
outcomes are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events, and potentially 
mediating variables will be carefully monitored.
DISCUSSION: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the causal role 
of tackling RNT (worry, rumination) using a self-help mobile app with respect to 
preventing depression in university students. This knowledge will be used to 
develop and disseminate innovative evidence-based, feasible, and effective 
mobile-health public health strategies for preventing common mental health 
problems.

BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of untreated postpartum depression among 
adolescent mothers with the greatest gap in services in low- and middle-income 
countries. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of nonspecialists to 
provide mental health services for postpartum depression in these low-resource 
settings. However, there is inconsistency in short-term and long-term benefits 
from the interventions. Passive sensing data generated from wearable digital 
devices can be used to more accurately distinguish which mothers will benefit 
from psychological services. In addition, wearable digital sensors can be used 
to passively collect data to personalize care for mothers. Therefore, wearable 
passive sensing technology has the potential to improve outcomes from 
psychological treatments for postpartum depression.
OBJECTIVE: This study will explore the use of wearable digital sensors for two 
objectives: First, we will pilot test using wearable sensors to generate passive 
sensing data that distinguish adolescent mothers with depression from those 
without depression. Second, we will explore how nonspecialists can integrate 
data from passive sensing technologies to better personalize psychological 
treatment.
METHODS: This study will be conducted in rural Nepal with participatory 
involvement of adolescent mothers and health care stakeholders through a 
community advisory board. The first study objective will be addressed by 
comparing behavioral patterns of adolescent mothers without depression (n=20) 
and with depression (n=20). The behavioral patterns will be generated by 
wearable digital devices collecting data in 4 domains: (1) the physical activity 
of mothers using accelerometer data on mobile phones, (2) the geographic range 
and routine of mothers using GPS (Global Positioning System) data collected from 
mobile phones, (3) the time and routine of adolescent mothers with their infants 
using proximity data collected from Bluetooth beacons, and (4) the verbal 
stimulation and auditory environment for mothers and infants using episodic 
audio recordings on mobile phones. For the second objective, the same 4 domains 
of data will be collected and shared with nonspecialists who are delivering an 
evidence-based behavioral activation intervention to the depressed adolescent 
mothers. Over 5 weeks of the intervention, we will document how passive sensing 
data are used by nonspecialists to personalize the intervention. In addition, 
qualitative data on feasibility and acceptability of passive data collection 
will be collected for both objectives.
RESULTS: To date, a community advisory board comprising young women and health 
workers engaged with adolescent mothers has been established. The study is open 
for recruitment, and data collection is anticipated to be completed in November 
2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of passive sensing data in public health and clinical 
programs for mothers at risk of perinatal mental health problems has the 
potential to more accurately identify who will benefit from services and 
increase the effectiveness by personalizing psychological interventions.

BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (depression during pregnancy or the first year 
postpartum) affects 10%-25% of perinatal individuals, with a higher risk among 
youths aged <25 years. The Mothers and Babies Course (MB) is an evidence-based 
intervention for the prevention of perinatal depression, grounded in cognitive 
behavioral therapy, attachment theory, and psychoeducation.
OBJECTIVE: We developed a digital adaptation of MB (Interactive Maternal Group 
for Information and Emotional Support [IMAGINE]) and evaluated it in a pre-post 
mixed methods pilot among young perinatal people in the United States.
METHODS: IMAGINE was a structured digital group of up to 7 participants, with 
scheduled MB content and open discussion for 12 weeks, facilitated by a social 
worker. Scheduled content included asynchronous SMS text messages, graphics, 
prerecorded videos, mood polls, and optional weekly synchronous video calls. 
Eligible participants were pregnant or ≤80 days postpartum, aged 16 to 24 years, 
had access to a smartphone, spoke English, and had a Patient Health 
Questionnaire score <10. Participants were recruited throughout the United 
States from August 2020 to January 2021 through paid social media ads, in-person 
outreach at clinics, and respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed 
quantitative questionnaires at enrollment and 3 months, and qualitative 
interviews at 3 months. We determined uptake, acceptability (by Acceptability of 
Intervention Measure score), and utility (by use of cognitive behavioral therapy 
skills). We compared depression symptoms (by Patient Health Questionnaire 
score), social support (by abbreviated Social Support Behavior score), and 
perceived stress (by Perceived Stress Score) between enrollment and follow-up by 
paired 2-tailed t test.
RESULTS: Among 68 individuals who contacted this study, 22 were screened, 13 
were eligible, and 10 enrolled, for an uptake of 76.9%. Furthermore, 4 (40%) 
participants were pregnant at enrollment. Participants had a median age of 17.9 
(IQR 17.4-21.7) years, 6 (67%) identified as Black, 5 (56%) Latinx, and 6 (67%) 
using Medicaid health insurance. Further, 9 (90%) participants completed 
follow-up. Among these, the mean acceptability score was 4.3 out of 5 (SD 0.6) 
and all participants said they would recommend IMAGINE to a friend. Participants 
reported using a median of 7 of 11 skills (IQR 5-7 skills) at least half the 
days. We found no significant changes in depression symptoms, perceived stress, 
or social support. Qualitatively, participants reported one-to-one support from 
the facilitator, connection with other parents, and regular mood reflection were 
especially helpful aspects of the intervention. Additionally, participants 
reported that the intervention normalized their mental health challenges, 
improved their ability to manage their mood, and increased their openness to 
mental health care.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides promising evidence of the acceptability 
and utility of IMAGINE among perinatal youths. Our study's small sample size did 
not detect changes in clinical outcomes; our findings suggest IMAGINE warrants 
larger-scale evaluation.

Homebound Older Adults With Depression: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled 
Trial.

BACKGROUND: Depression in older adults has serious biological, psychological, 
and social consequences. Homebound older adults experience a high burden of 
depression and significant barriers to accessing mental health treatments. Few 
interventions to address their specific needs have been developed. Existing 
treatment modalities can be challenging to scale up, are not tailored to unique 
population concerns, and require significant staffing support. 
Technology-assisted, layperson-facilitated psychotherapy has the potential to 
overcome these challenges.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 
layperson-facilitated internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program 
tailored for homebound older adults. The novel intervention, Empower@Home, was 
developed based on user-centered design principles and partnerships between 
researchers, social service agencies, care recipients, and other stakeholders 
serving low-income homebound older adults.
METHODS: This 2-arm, 20-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 
waitlist control crossover design aims to enroll 70 community-dwelling older 
adults with elevated depressive symptoms. The treatment group will receive the 
10-week intervention immediately, whereas the waitlist control group will cross 
over and receive the intervention after 10 weeks. This pilot is part of a 
multiphase project involving a single-group feasibility study (completed in 
December 2022). This project consists of a pilot RCT (described in this 
protocol) and an implementation feasibility study running in parallel with the 
pilot RCT. The primary clinical outcome of the pilot is the change in depressive 
symptoms after the intervention and at the 20-week postrandomization follow-up. 
Additional outcomes include acceptability, adherence, and changes in anxiety, 
social isolation, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for the proposed trial 
in April 2022. Recruitment for the pilot RCT began in January 2023 and is 
anticipated to end in September 2023. On completion of the pilot trial, we will 
examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on depression symptoms and 
other secondary clinical outcomes in an intention-to-treat analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Although web-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs are 
available, most programs have low adherence and very few are tailored for older 
adults. Our intervention addresses this gap. Older adults, particularly those 
with mobility difficulties and multiple chronic health conditions, could benefit 
from internet-based psychotherapy. This approach can serve a pressing need in 
society while being cost-effective, scalable, and convenient. This pilot RCT 
builds on a completed single-group feasibility study by determining the 
preliminary effects of the intervention compared with a control condition. The 
findings will provide a foundation for a future fully-powered randomized 
controlled efficacy trial. If our intervention is found to be effective, 
implications extend to other digital mental health interventions and populations 
with physical disabilities and access restrictions who face persistent 
disparities in mental health.

BACKGROUND: Depression affects 32% of older adults. Loneliness and social 
isolation are common risk factors for depression in older adults. Mobile apps 
can connect users and are also effective in depression management in the general 
population. However, older adults have specific needs in terms of the content of 
depression self-care interventions and their accessibility. It remains unknown 
whether existing apps for depression self-care are applicable to older adults.
OBJECTIVE: The initial aim of this assessment was to systematically identify 
interactive depression self-care apps specifically designed for older adults. As 
we did not find any, we assessed the applicability of existing depression 
self-care apps to the needs of older adult users.
METHODS: Using an established app assessment methodology, we searched for 
Android and iOS interactive mental health apps providing self-care for 
depression in English and Chinese in the 42Matters database, Chinese Android app 
stores, and the first 10 pages of Google and Baidu. We developed an assessment 
rubric based on extensive revision of the literature. The rubric consisted of 
the following sections: general characteristics of the apps (eg, developer, 
platform, and category), app content (eg, epidemiology and risk factors of 
depression in older adults, techniques to improve mood and well-being), and 
technical aspects (eg, accessibility, privacy and confidentiality, and 
engagement).
RESULTS: We identified 23 apps (n=19, 82.6%, English and n=4, 17.4%, Chinese 
apps), with 5 (21.7%) iOS-only apps, 3 (13%) Android-only apps, and 15 (65.2%) 
apps on both platforms. None specifically targeted older adults with depression. 
All apps were designed by commercial companies and were free to download. Most 
of the apps incorporated cognitive behavior therapy, mood monitoring, or 
journaling. All but 3 (13%) apps had a privacy and confidentiality policy. In 
addition, 14 (60.9%) apps covered depression risk factors in older adults, and 3 
(13%) apps delivered information about depression epidemiology in older adults 
via a chatbot. Furthermore, 17 (73.9%) apps mentioned other topics relevant to 
older adults, such as pain management, grief, loneliness, and social isolation. 
Around 30% (n=7) of the apps were supported by an online forum. Common 
accessibility issues included a lack of adaptations for users with visual or 
hearing impairments and incompatibility with larger font sizes in the phone 
settings.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no depression apps developed specifically for older 
adults. Available mobile apps have limited applicability to older adults in 
terms of their clinical and technical features. Depression self-care apps should 
aim to incorporate content relevant to older adults, such as grief and loss; 
include online communities; and improve accessibility to adapt to potential 
health impairments in older adults.

OBJECTIVE: To explore which cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) self-help app 
usage predicted depression during a selective prevention trial.
METHOD: A recent controlled trial (ECoWeB-PREVENT) randomized young people aged 
16-22, at increased risk for depression because of elevated worry/rumination, 
negative appraisals, and/or rejection sensitivity but without past or current 
history of major depression, to apps that provided self-monitoring, 
self-monitoring plus CBT self-help, or self-monitoring plus emotional competency 
self-help. Self-help included coping strategies for moment-by-moment use (Tools) 
and self-learning/planning exercises (Challenges). On the primary outcome 
(depression, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3-months follow-up 
(primary endpoint), only the CBT app outperformed self-monitoring. In this 
secondary analysis, only data from participants who used the CBT or 
self-monitoring apps at least once were analyzed to test what app use predicted 
change in depression from baseline to 3 months.
RESULTS: Of the original 1,262 participants (79% female), 558 were included 
(CBT, baseline, n = 273, PHQ-9: M = 7.48, SD = 3.9; 3 months, N = 163, PHQ-9: M 
= 8.83, SD = 4.92; self-monitoring, baseline, n = 285, PHQ-9: M = 7.45, SD = 
4.26; 3 months, N = 183, PHQ-9: M = 7.48, SD = 3.9). Neither total app use, 
self-monitoring, nor use of Tools predicted change in depression (all ps > .05). 
Frequency of use of Challenges predicted lower depression symptoms and caseness 
at 3 months (β = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.53, -0.03], p = .029). Specifically, the use 
of behavioral activation challenges mediated the effects of the CBT app on 
depression over 3 months (β = -0.59, 95% CI [-1.13, -0.05], p = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Brief psychoeducation about behavioral activation principles in an 
app may protect young people from depression over 3 months, even when only used 
once. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).

BACKGROUND: Firefighters are frequently exposed to traumatic events and 
stressful environments and are at particularly high risk of depressive symptoms.
AIMS: The present study aimed to examine the impact of a combined 
internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) and attention bias 
modification (ABM) intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in firefighters.
METHOD: The study was a randomized controlled trial carried out in Kunming, 
China, and involved the recruitment of 138 active firefighters as participants. 
The intervention lasted for an 8-week duration, during which participants 
participated in ABM exercises on alternating days and concurrently underwent 
eight modules of iCBT courses delivered through a smartphone application. 
Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted to evaluate the 
effects of the intervention.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results indicated that the combined iCBT and ABM 
intervention was significantly effective in reducing symptoms of depression 
compared with the no intervention control group (U=1644, p<0.001, Wilcoxon 
r=0.280). No significant change was observed in attention bias post-intervention 
(U=2460, p=0.737, Wilcoxon r=0.039), while a significant increase was observed 
in attention-bias variability (U=3172, p<0.001, Wilcoxon r=-0.287). This study 
provides evidence for the effectiveness of the combined iCBT and ABM 
intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among firefighters. This study 
provides conceptual support and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of 
the combined iCBT and ABM intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among 
firefighters.

BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders and problematic drinking often co-occur, also 
among young adults. These co-occurring conditions are associated with various 
negative health outcomes compared to both conditions alone. Early intervention 
by addressing alcohol use and depressive symptoms simultaneously in the same 
treatment might improve both conditions. However, evidence on the (cost-) 
effectiveness of digital combined depression and alcohol interventions for young 
adults is currently insufficient. We therefore developed an add-on digital 
alcohol moderation adherence-focussed guided intervention to complement 
treatment as usual (TAU) for depressive disorders. The digital intervention is a 
web-app, including 6 modules based on motivational interviewing and cognitive 
behavioural therapy. This study aims to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a 
digital alcohol moderation intervention + TAU compared to TAU on alcohol and 
depression outcomes among young adults with co-occurring depressive disorders 
and problematic alcohol use.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-six participants, aged 18-35 years, with problematic 
alcohol use and a diagnosed depressive disorder will participate in a pragmatic 
multicentre two-arm randomized controlled trial. Problematic alcohol use is 
operationalised as scoring ≥5 for women and ≥ 8 for men on the Alcohol Use 
Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Participants will be randomized to either 
the experimental group (digital alcohol intervention + TAU) or control group 
(TAU only). Participants will be recruited at three Dutch mental health care 
centres and through social media. Assessments take place at baseline and after 
3, 6 and 12 months post-randomization. The primary outcome is treatment response 
at 6-month follow-up, operationalized as a composite score that combines alcohol 
use and depression measures and indicates whether treatment has been successful 
or not. Secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms and alcohol use (i.e. number 
of weekly standard drinks and AUDIT score). An economic evaluation will be 
conducted alongside the trial.
DISCUSSION: This study evaluates the (cost-) effectiveness of an add-on digital 
alcohol moderation intervention for young adults who are in treatment for 
depressive disorders. If proven effective, the digital intervention could be 
implemented in mental health care and improve treatment for people with 
co-occurring depressive disorders and problematic alcohol use.

BACKGROUND: Research shows that internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy 
(iCBT) is an effective treatment for depression. However, little is known about 
how the length of the text material in iCBT affects outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether a condensed iCBT version 
for depression would be non-inferior to the existing full-text version in 
reducing depressive symptoms at post-treatment. We also wanted to test 
non-inferiority for secondary outcomes and explore reading speed and ADHD 
symptoms as potential moderators.
METHOD: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted (N = 267) 
comparing two versions of guided iCBT for depression; full-text (around 60,000 
words) and condensed (around 30,000 words, with the option to listen to the 
text). Estimated between-group effect sizes and their confidence intervals for 
depression, anxiety and quality of life, were compared to a pre-determined 
non-inferiority margin (ES = 0.4). Moderation analyses of reading speed and ADHD 
symptoms were conducted.
RESULTS: The condensed version of iCBT was non-inferior to the full-text version 
on post-treatment measures for depressive symptoms (95 % CI = -0.42-0.24), 
anxiety symptoms (95 % CI = -0.24-0.32), and quality of life (95 % 
CI = -0.09-0.49). Non-inferiority was inconclusive for depressive symptoms at 
the one-year follow-up (95 % CI = -0.60-0.47). There was no significant 
moderation effects of reading speed (p = 0.06) or ADHD symptoms (p = 0.11) on 
depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a condensed version of iCBT for 
depression is as effective at treating depression as the full-text version. By 
shortening texts, iCBT may be made available to more people. Due to unequal 
dropout rates between the groups, these results are preliminary and need to be 
replicated.

INTRODUCTION: Interventions that improve both physical activity and sleep 
quality may be more effective in improving overall health. The purpose of the 
Synergy Study is to test the efficacy of a mobile health combined behavior 
intervention targeting physical activity and sleep quality.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, waitlist-controlled trial.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This study had an app-based delivery mode, Australia-wide. 
The participants were 160 adults who reported insufficient physical activity and 
poor sleep quality in an eligibility survey.
INTERVENTION: The intervention was a mobile app providing educational resources, 
goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback strategies. It included 12 weeks of 
personalized support including weekly reports, tool sheets, and prompts.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary), 
and 6 months (secondary endpoint). Self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous 
intensity physical activity and sleep quality were co-primary outcomes. 
Resistance training; sitting time; sleep hygiene; sleep timing variability; 
insomnia severity; daytime sleepiness; quality of life; and depression, anxiety, 
and stress symptoms were secondary outcomes. Data were collected between June 
2017 and February 2018 and analyzed in August 2018.
RESULTS: At 3 months, between-group differences in moderate-to-vigorous 
intensity physical activity were not statistically significant (p=0.139). 
Significantly more participants in the intervention group engaged in ≥2 
days/week (p=0.004) of resistance training. The intervention group reported 
better overall sleep quality (p=0.009), subjective sleep quality (p=0.017), 
sleep onset latency (p=0.013), waketime variability (p=0.018), sleep hygiene 
(p=0.027), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and lower stress symptoms (p=0.032) 
relative to waitlist controls. At 6 months, group differences were maintained 
for sleep hygiene (p=0.048), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and stress symptoms 
(p=0.006). Differences were observed for bedtime variability (p=0.023), 
sleepiness (p<0.001), daytime dysfunction (p=0.039), and anxiety symptoms 
(p=0.003) at 6 months, but not 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: This remotely delivered intervention did not produce statistically 
significant between-group differences in minutes of moderate-to-vigorous 
intensity physical activity. Significant short-term differences in resistance 
training and short- and medium-term differences in sleep health in favor of the 
intervention were observed.

INTRODUCTION: The impact of depressed mood in daily life is difficult to 
investigate using traditional retrospective assessments, given daily or even 
within-day mood fluctuations in various contexts. This study aimed to use a 
smartphone-based ambulatory assessment to examine real-time relationships 
between depressed mood and functional behaviors among individuals with stroke.
METHODS: A total of 202 participants with mild-to-moderate stroke (90% ischemic, 
45% female, 44% Black) completed an ecological momentary assessment five times 
per day for 2 weeks by reporting their depressed mood and functional behaviors 
regarding where, with whom, and what activity was spent.
RESULTS: Participants spent 28% of their wake-up time participating in passive 
leisure activities but spent the least time in physical (4%) and vocational (9%) 
activities. Depressed mood was concurrently lower when participants engaged in 
social activities (β = -0.023 ± 0.011) and instrumental activities of daily 
living (β = -0.061 ± 0.013); spent time with family members 
(β = -0.061 ± 0.014), spouses (β = -0.043, ± 0.016), friends 
(β = -0.094, ± 0.021), and coworkers (β = -0.050 ± 0.021); and were located in 
restaurants (β = -0.068 ± 0.029), and homes of family members 
(β = -0.039 ± 0.020) or friends (β = -0.069 ± 0.031). Greater depressed mood was 
associated with worse ratings in satisfaction, performance, and engagement of 
activities in concurrent (βs = -0.036 ± 0.003, -0.053 ± 0.003, -0.044 ± 0.003) 
and time-lagged models (βs = -0.011 ± 0.004, -0.012 ± 0.004, -0.013 ± 0.004).
DISCUSSION: Smartphone-based ambulatory assessment can elucidate functional 
behaviors and associated mood after stroke. Findings support behavioral 
activation treatments to schedule social and instrumental activities for stroke 
survivors to reduce their depressed mood.

Although impressive progress has been made toward developing 
empirically-supported psychological treatments, the reality remains that 
a significant proportion of people with mental health problems do not receive 
these treatments. Finding ways to reduce this treatment gap is crucial. Since 
app-supported smartphone interventions are touted as a possible solution, access 
to up-to-date guidance around the evidence base and clinical utility of these 
interventions is needed. We conducted a meta-analysis of 66 randomized 
controlled trials of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health 
problems. Smartphone interventions significantly outperformed control conditions 
in improving depressive (g=0.28, n=54) and generalized anxiety (g=0.30, n=39) 
symptoms, stress levels (g=0.35, n=27), quality of life (g=0.35, n=43), general 
psychiatric distress (g=0.40, n=12), social anxiety symptoms (g=0.58, n=6), and 
positive affect (g=0.44, n=6), with most effects being robust even after 
adjusting for various possible biasing factors (type of control condition, risk 
of bias rating). Smartphone interventions conferred no significant benefit over 
control conditions on panic symptoms (g=-0.05, n=3), post-traumatic stress 
symptoms (g=0.18, n=4), and negative affect (g=-0.08, n=5). Studies that 
delivered a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based app and offered professional 
guidance and reminders to engage produced larger effects on multiple outcomes. 
Smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active interventions 
(face-to-face, computerized treatment), although the number of studies was low 
(n≤13). The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for common mental 
health problems was thus confirmed. Although mental health apps are not intended 
to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the 
potential of apps to serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low 
intensity intervention for those who cannot receive standard psychological 
treatment.

Background: Depression represents a major public health burden, especially in 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Telepsychiatry provides a promising 
solution by offering remote mental health services, overcoming barriers such as 
limited resources, isolation, and cost. This study aimed to evaluate the 
comparative efficacy of different telepsychiatry interventions in LMICs by 
network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We 
searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & 
Theses from inception to May 2024 to identify all relevant studies. 
Telepsychiatry interventions were categorized as: (1) CBTAppGuided, a cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) app with professional guidance; (2) CBTChatBot, a CBT 
app that uses a chatbot for guidance; (3) CBTApp, a CBT app without professional 
guidance; (4) Reminder; and (5) Consultation. Study quality was assessed 
according to the Effective Practice and Organization of Care guideline. 
Depression severity was calculated using summary standardized mean differences 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Seven RCTs were included with a 
total of 1,469 adults (mean age range: 16.0-35.64 years). Compared with 
face-to-face usual care, the most effective telepsychiatry intervention was 
CBTAppGuided [-23.04, 95% CI: -26.12 to -19.96], followed by CBTChatBot [-5.27, 
95% CI: -6.25 to -4.29]. Other interventions, including CBTApp [-0.83, 95% CI: 
-1.32 to -0.34], Reminder [-0.44, 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.16], and Consultation 
[-0.27, 95% CI: -0.78 to 0.26], demonstrated smaller effects. CBTAppGuided, 
CBTChatBot, CBTApp, and Reminder achieved statistically significant improvement, 
whereas Consultation did not show statistically significant improvement and was 
not different from face-to-face treatment. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry 
interventions, particularly CBTAppGuided, show potential for reducing depression 
severity in LMICs, with promising outcomes for both guided and unguided 
app-based formats. Further research is needed to confirm their effectiveness in 
resource-limited settings.

INTRODUCTION: Studies on mental health applications among college students lack 
empirical evidence regarding mobile application usage's intensity, duration and 
frequency.
AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural therapy 
(CBT)-based mobile application in ameliorating depressive symptoms among college 
students.
METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at three universities. 
Undergraduates aged ≥ 20 years with self-reported depressive symptoms were 
recruited and randomly assigned to the control and intervention groups. The 
outcomes include changes in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, help-seeking 
attitudes and emotional self-awareness at 4 (T1), 8 (T2) and 12 (T3) weeks. An 
intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Of the 91 participants, 46 in the intervention group exhibited a 
significant decline in depressive symptoms at T1 and lower patterns of symptom 
changes at T2 and T3. No significant differences were observed in the other 
outcomes; however, higher help-seeking attitude, emotional self-awareness and 
lower suicidal ideation after T0 were observed for those who used the 
application for 12 weeks.
DISCUSSION: The advantages of a brief application-based intervention to promote 
college students' psychological health are outlined.
IMPLICATIONS: School nursing managers could use the application to improve the 
college mental health systems and support collegial teacher-student 
relationships.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Further studies should enhance application usage to manage 
depressive symptoms.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of 
the National Taiwan University Hospital (No. 202108098RINB, Date of approval: 
Oct 27, 2021) and the National Institutes of Health (No. NCT05188950).

Little research has examined exercise-based interventions meant to alleviate 
depressive symptoms among Korean-Chinese migrant women workers living in Korea. 
Thus, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a 24-week walking program on 
reducing depressive symptoms and acculturative stress levels in this population. 
This quasi-experimental sequential walking program was conducted with 132 
Korean-Chinese women over a period of 24 weeks. Participants were divided into 
either a standard treatment group (n = 69) or enhanced treatment group (n = 63). 
All participants were instructed to walk using a pedometer. The enhanced 
treatment group also received mobile text messages designed to encourage walking 
adherence and improve acculturation. Participants were asked to complete two 
structured questionnaires, the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 
and the Acculturative Stress Scale, to evaluate the intervention programs. At 
the end of the program, both groups exhibited decreased depression scores, but 
the decrease in the enhanced treatment group was more significant both at weeks 
12 and 24. Acculturative stress was also found to have decreased at weeks 12 and 
24. Our findings show the walking program reduced the depressive symptoms and 
acculturative stress levels among the Korean-Chinese women in this study. 
Further studies will be needed to analyze the relationship between walking step 
count and mental health considering exercise intensity.

Research shows that over 70% of individuals globally who require mental health 
services lack access to adequate care. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, 
such as phone apps, can be a potential solution to this issue by enabling 
broader and more affordable reach, thus addressing the problem of limited access 
to care. This study evaluates the effectiveness of evidence-based health apps on 
user mental health outcomes, particularly depression, anxiety, and suicidal 
behaviors. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of 
Science, and IEEE databases. In total, 6894 studies were identified, and 38 
studies were selected for the review-thirty out of 38 studies employed 
randomized controlled trial designs. We identified 35 unique mobile apps. All 
the apps leveraged Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based approaches. The most 
common approaches were context engagement and cognitive change, highlighting a 
significant focus on using personalized engagement activities and empowering 
users to alter their perspectives and reframe negative thoughts to improve their 
mental health. While mental health apps generally positively impact mental 
health outcomes, the findings also highlight significant variability in their 
effectiveness. Future studies should prioritize long-term effectiveness, wider 
reach to ensure it suits a diverse range of people, and the employment of 
objective evaluation methodologies.

BACKGROUND: Substance Use Disorder (SUD) persists as a significant public health 
challenge worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 10-15% across 
the global populace. This condition is characterized by a notably high risk of 
lapses and relapses, even subsequent to treatment interventions. Mobile health 
interventions, owing to their widespread accessibility, emerge as a promising 
approach to diminish the risk of relapse post-treatment and to broaden the scope 
of care, especially in regions with a scarcity of trained medical professionals.
METHOD: This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of mobile 
interventions in mitigating cravings and preventing lapses among individuals 
diagnosed with SUD. Employing a two-armed, randomized controlled trial 
framework, the study will evaluate a self-administered psychological 
intervention delivered through a mobile application, Nałogometr 2.0. Over a 
period of three months, participants will engage with intervention modules that 
primarily incorporate mindfulness techniques and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
(CBT) principles. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) will be utilized to 
gather longitudinal data on a range of variables that are indicative of craving 
intensity and the risk of lapse. In addition to this, a monthly-administered 
battery of questionnaires will be employed to gauge the severity of substance 
dependence, as well as to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and overall 
life satisfaction.
RESULTS: Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is recognized as one of the 
most effective methods for reducing the risk of perinatal depression. However, 
the traditional face-to-face delivery format limits its accessibility. With the 
advent of digital technology, app-based CBT offers new possibilities, yet its 
preventive role in perinatal depression remains insufficiently explored. This 
study aims to determine if pregnant women using an app-based CBT program report 
reduced depressive and anxious symptoms compared to a control group.
METHODS: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial of 290 pregnant women 
will be conducted at Jintang County Maternity and Child Health Hospital in 
Chengdu, China. Eligible participants who consent to participate will be 
recruited at 20-24 weeks of gestation and randomly assigned to either the 
intervention group, which will complete an 8-week mobile app-based CBT program 
(CareMom), or a control group, which will receive an attention-matched 8-week 
relaxation training program, also delivered via a mobile app. Randomization will 
be performed using a computer-generated random number sequence. Primary outcomes 
include changes in scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item from 
baseline to 6 weeks postpartum. Outcome analyses will be performed on both the 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations.
DISCUSSION: This trial evaluates an app-based CBT program for reducing the risk 
of perinatal depression. Improved maternal mental health not only benefits the 
mothers themselves but also may facilitate more optimal parenting behaviors, 
which could exert a positive influence on the cognitive, emotional, and 
behavioral development of the infant.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in the development of scalable digital 
mental health interventions for perinatal populations to increase accessibility. 
Mobile behavioral activation (BA) is efficacious for the treatment of perinatal 
depression; however, the effect of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) on 
symptom trajectories remains underexplored. This is important given that at 
least 10% of women in the perinatal period experience CAD.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether there were differences in symptom trajectories in 
pregnant participants with CAD as compared to those with depression only (ie, 
major depressive disorder [MDD]) during intervention with a BA mobile gaming 
app.
METHODS: Pregnant adults with either CAD (n=10) or MDD (n=7) used a BA app for 
10 weeks and completed biweekly symptom severity questionnaires for depression 
and anxiety. We assessed whether baseline diagnoses were associated with 
differential symptom trajectories across the study with mixed effects 
longitudinal models.
RESULTS: When controlling for baseline symptoms, results revealed a significant 
interaction between baseline diagnosis and the quadratic component of study week 
on anxiety (β=.18, SE 0.07; t62=2.61; P=.01), revealing a tendency for anxiety 
in the CAD group to increase initially and then decrease at an accelerated rate, 
whereas MDD symptoms were relatively stable across time. There was a significant 
effect of linear time on depression (β=-.39, SE 0.11; t68=-3.51; P=.001), 
showing that depression declined steadily across time for both groups. There was 
a significant effect of baseline diagnosis on depression (β=-8.53, SE 3.93; 
t13=-2.17; P=.05), suggesting that those with MDD had higher follow-up 
depression compared to those with CAD when holding other predictors constant.
CONCLUSIONS: The app was beneficial in reducing depression symptoms in perinatal 
individuals with different comorbidity profiles. With respect to anxiety symptom 
trajectories, however, there was more variability. The app may be especially 
effective for the treatment of anxiety symptoms among individuals with CAD, as 
it encourages in-the-moment ecologically relevant exposure to anxiety-provoking 
stimuli. Despite no significant group difference in baseline anxiety symptoms, 
the MDD group did not have a significant reduction in their anxiety symptoms 
across the study period, and some individuals had an increase in anxiety. 
Findings may point to opportunities for the augmentation of BA gaming apps for 
those with MDD to more effectively target anxiety symptoms. Overall, findings 
suggest there may be value in considering comorbidities and individual 
variations in participants when developing scalable mobile interventions for 
perinatal populations.

BACKGROUND: Digital health apps are efficacious treatment options for 
mild-to-moderate depressive disorders. However, the extent to which 
psychological guidance increases the efficacy of these apps is controversial.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of a web-based intervention, called 
Selfapy, for unipolar depression. We also investigated differences between 
psychotherapist-guided and unguided versions.
METHODS: Selfapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention for 
depressive disorders. Participants with mild-to-severe depressive disorders were 
assigned randomly to participate in either guided (weekly 25-minute duration 
telephone calls) intervention, unguided version, or waiting list (control group) 
for 12 weeks. We assessed depressive symptoms at the start of the study, midway 
through the intervention (6 weeks), at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), 
and at follow-up (6 months). The main outcome was difference in the Beck 
Depression Inventory score between the start of the study and the end of the 
intervention. Secondary outcomes were the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology-Self Report, the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, and the Beck 
Anxiety Inventory.
RESULTS: Of 401 participants, 301 participants (75.1%) completed the 
intervention. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory from baseline differed 
significantly between groups at the postintervention (F2,398=37.20, P<.001). The 
reductions in scores for both guided and unguided intervention groups were 
greater than that for the control group, with large between-group effect sizes 
(guided vs control: d=1.63, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.93; unguided vs control: d=1.47, 
95% CI 1.22 to 1.73) at postintervention. No significant differences were found 
between guided and unguided intervention groups (P=.18). At follow-up (6 
months), treatment effects on the primary outcome were maintained for both 
intervention groups (guided: F1,194=0.62, P>.999; unguided: F1,176=0.13, 
P>.999).
CONCLUSIONS: Both guided and unguided versions of the intervention were highly 
effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Follow-up data suggest that these 
effects could be maintained. The guided version was not superior to the unguided

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and general distress has 
risen in recent years. Mobile mental health programs have been found to provide 
support to nonclinical populations and may overcome some of the barriers 
associated with traditional in-person treatment; however, researchers have 
voiced concerns that many publicly available mobile mental health programs lack 
evidence-based theoretical foundations, peer-reviewed research, and sufficient 
engagement from the public.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary outcomes of Noom Mood, a commercial mobile cognitive behavioral 
therapy- and mindfulness-based program.
METHODS: In this single-arm prospective cohort study, individuals who joined 
Noom Mood between August and October 2021 completed surveys at baseline and 
4-week follow-up. Per-protocol analyses included those who completed both 
surveys (n=113), and intention-to-treat analyses included all participants 
(N=185).
RESULTS: A majority of the sample reported that the program is easy to use, they 
felt confident recommending the program to a friend, and they perceived the 
program to be effective at improving stress and anxiety. There were significant 
improvements in anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, depressive feelings, emotion 
regulation, and optimism in both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat 
analyses (all P<.001). Participants reported benefiting most from learning 
skills (eg, breathing and cognitive reframing techniques), interacting with the 
program features, and gaining awareness of their emotions and thought patterns. 
Participants also made a number of suggestions to improve product functionality 
and usability.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that Noom Mood is feasible and acceptable to 
participants, with promising preliminary outcomes. Future studies should build 
on these results to evaluate the effects of Noom Mood using more rigorous 
designs.

BACKGROUND: Exposure and response prevention, a type of cognitive-behavioral 
therapy, is an effective first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD). Despite extensive evidence of the efficacy of exposure and response 
prevention (ERP) from clinical studies and in real-world samples, it is still 
underused as a treatment. This is likely due to the limits to access to care 
that include the availability of adequately trained therapists, as well as 
geographical location, time, and cost barriers. To address these, NOCD created a 
digital behavioral health treatment for OCD using ERP delivered via video 
teletherapy and with technology-assisted elements including app-based therapy 
tools and between-session therapist messaging.
OBJECTIVE: We examined treatment outcomes in a large naturalistic sample of 3552 
adults with a primary OCD diagnosis who received NOCD treatment.
METHODS: The treatment model consisted of twice-weekly, live, face-to-face video 
teletherapy ERP for 3 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of once-weekly brief video 
teletherapy check-ins for 30 minutes. Assessments were conducted at baseline, at 
midpoint after completion of 3 weeks of twice-weekly sessions, and at the end of 
6 weeks of brief check-ins (endpoint). Longitudinal assessments were also 
obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after endpoint.
RESULTS: Treatment resulted in clinically and statistically significant 
improvements, with a 43.4% mean reduction in obsessive-compulsive symptoms 
(g=1.0; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03) and a 62.9% response rate. Treatment also resulted 
in a 44.2% mean reduction in depression, a 47.8% mean reduction in anxiety, and 
a 37.3% mean reduction in stress symptoms. Quality of life improved by a mean of 
22.7%. Reduction in OCD symptoms and response rates were similar for those with 
mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. The mean duration of treatment was 11.5 (SD 
4.0) weeks, and the mean total therapist time was 10.6 (SD 1.1) hours. 
Improvements were maintained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, representing the largest reported treated cohort of 
patients with OCD to date, video teletherapy treatment demonstrated 
effectiveness in reducing obsessive-compulsive and comorbid symptoms and 
improved quality of life. Further, it achieved meaningful results in less than 
half the total therapist time compared with standard once-weekly outpatient 
treatment, an efficiency that represents substantial monetary and time savings. 
The effect size was large and similar to studies of in-person ERP. This 
technology-assisted remote treatment is readily accessible for patients, 
offering an advancement in the field in the dissemination of effective 
evidence-based care for OCD.

Late-life depression is heterogenous and patients vary in disease course over 
time. Most psychotherapy studies measure activity levels and symptoms solely 
using self-report scales, administered periodically. These scales may not 
capture granular changes during treatment. We introduce the potential utility of 
passive sensing data collected with smartphone to assess fluctuations in daily 
functioning in real time during psychotherapy for late life depression in elder 
abuse victims. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of passive 
sensing among depressed elder abuse victims. We present data from three victims 
who received a 9-week intervention as part of a pilot randomized controlled 
trial and showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (50% reduction). 
Using a smartphone, we tracked participants' daily number of smartphone unlocks, 
time spent at home, time spent in conversation, and step count over treatment. 
Independent assessment of depressive symptoms and behavioral activation were 
collected at intake, Weeks 6 and 9. Data revealed patient-level fluctuations in 
activity level over treatment, corresponding with self-reported behavioral 
activation. We demonstrate how passive sensing data could expand our 
understanding of heterogenous presentations of late-life depression among elder 
abuse. We illustrate how trajectories of change in activity levels as measured 
with passive sensing and subjective measures can be tracked concurrently over 
time. We outline challenges and potential solutions for application of passive 
sensing data collection in future studies with larger samples using novel 
advanced statistical modeling, such as artificial intelligence algorithms.

Psychotherapy nonattendance is a costly and pervasive problem. While prior 
research has identified stable patient-level predictors of attendance, far less 
is known about dynamic (i.e., time-varying) factors. Identifying dynamic 
predictors can clarify how clinical states relate to psychotherapy attendance 
and inform effective "just-in-time" interventions to promote attendance. The 
present study examines whether daily mood, as measured by responses to automated 
mobile phone-based text messages, prospectively predicts attendance in group 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. Fifty-six Spanish-speaking 
Latino patients with elevated depressive symptoms (46 women, mean 
age=50.92years, SD=10.90years), enrolled in a manualized program of group CBT, 
received daily automated mood-monitoring text messages. Patients' daily mood 
ratings, message response rate, and delay in responding were recorded. Patients' 
self-reported mood the day prior to a scheduled psychotherapy session 
significantly predicted attendance, even after controlling for patients' prior 
attendance history and age (OR=1.33, 95% CI [1.04, 1.70], p=.02). Positive mood 
corresponded to a greater likelihood of attendance. Our results demonstrate the 
clinical utility of automated mood-monitoring text messages in predicting 
attendance. These results underscore the value of text messaging, and other 
mobile technologies, as adjuncts to psychotherapy. Future work should explore 
the use of such monitoring to guide interventions to increase attendance, and 
ultimately the efficacy of psychotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Numerous mental health apps purport to alleviate depressive 
symptoms. Strong evidence suggests that brief cognitive behavioral therapy 
(bCBT)-based mental health apps can decrease depressive symptoms, yet there is 
limited research elucidating the specific features that may augment its 
therapeutic benefits. One potential design feature that may influence 
effectiveness and user experience is the inclusion of virtual agents that can 
mimic realistic, human face-to-face interactions.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current experiment was to determine the effect of 
conversational and animation features of a virtual agent within a bCBT-based 
mental health app on depressive symptoms and user experience in college students 
with and without depressive symptoms.
METHODS: College students (N=209) completed a 2-week intervention in which they 
engaged with a bCBT-based mental health app with a customizable therapeutic 
virtual agent that varied in conversational and animation features. A 2 (time: 
baseline vs 2-week follow-up) × 2 (conversational vs non-conversational agent) × 
2 (animated vs non-animated agent) randomized controlled trial was used to 
assess mental health symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8, Perceived Stress 
Scale-10, and Response Rumination Scale questionnaires) and user experience 
(mHealth App Usability Questionnaire, MAUQ) in college students with and without 
current depressive symptoms. The mental health app usability and qualitative 
questions regarding users' perceptions of their therapeutic virtual agent 
interactions and customization process were assessed at follow-up.
RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA (analysis of variance) results demonstrated a significant 
decrease in symptoms of depression (P=.002; mean [SD]=5.5 [4.86] at follow-up vs 
mean [SD]=6.35 [4.71] at baseline), stress (P=.005; mean [SD]=15.91 [7.67] at 
follow-up vs mean [SD]=17.02 [6.81] at baseline), and rumination (P=.03; mean 
[SD]=40.42 [12.96] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=41.92 [13.61] at baseline); 
however, no significant effect of conversation or animation was observed. 
Findings also indicate a significant increase in user experience in animated 
conditions. This significant increase in animated conditions is also reflected 
in the user's ease of use and satisfaction (F(1, 201)=102.60, P<.001), system 
information arrangement (F(1, 201)=123.12, P<.001), and usefulness of the 
application (F(1, 201)=3667.62, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The current experiment provides support for bCBT-based mental 
health apps featuring customizable, humanlike therapeutic virtual agents and 
their ability to significantly reduce negative symptomology over a brief 
timeframe. The app intervention reduced mental health symptoms, regardless of 
whether the agent included conversational or animation features, but animation 
features enhanced the user experience. These effects were observed in both users 
with and without depressive symptoms.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has received strong empirical support and is 
practiced widely as a treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and 
BPD with comorbid substance use disorders (BPD-SUD). Therapeutic success in DBT 
requires that individuals generalize newly acquired skills to their natural 
environment. However, there have been only a limited number of options available 
to achieve this end. The primary goal of this research was to develop and test 
the feasibility of the DBT Coach, a software application for a smartphone, 
designed specifically to enhance generalization of a specific DBT skill 
(opposite action) among individuals with BPD-SUD. We conducted a 
quasiexperimental study in which 22 individuals who were enrolled in DBT 
treatment programs received a smartphone with the DBT Coach for 10 to 14 days 
and were instructed to use it as needed. Participants used the DBT Coach an 
average of nearly 15 times and gave high ratings of helpfulness and usability. 
Results indicate that both emotion intensity and urges to use substances 
significantly decreased within each coaching session. Furthermore, over the 
trial period, participants reported a decrease in depression and general 
distress. Mobile technology offering in vivo skills coaching may be a useful 
tool for reducing urges to use substances and engage in other maladaptive 
behavior by directly teaching and coaching in alternative, adaptive coping 
behavior.

Measurement-based peer supervision is one strategy to assure the quality of 
psychological treatments delivered by non-mental health specialist providers. In 
this formative study, we aimed to 1) describe the development and 2) examine the 
acceptability and feasibility of PEERS (Promoting Effective mental healthcare 
through peER Supervision)-a novel smartphone app that aims to facilitate 
registering and scheduling patients, collecting patient outcomes, rating therapy 
quality and assessing supervision quality-among frontline treatment providers 
delivering behavioral activation treatment for depression. The PEERS prototype 
was developed and tested in 2021, and version 1 was launched in 2022. To date, 
215 treatment providers (98% female; ages 30-35) in Madhya Pradesh and Goa, 
India, have been trained to use PEERS and 65.58% have completed the 
supplemental, virtual PEERS course. Focus group discussions with 98 providers 
were examined according to four themes-training and education, app 
effectiveness, user experience and adherence and data privacy and safety. This 
yielded commonly endorsed facilitators (e.g., collaborative learning through 
group supervision, the convenience of consolidated patient data), barriers 
(e.g., difficulties with new technologies) and suggested changes (e.g., esthetic 
improvements, suicide risk assessment prompt). The PEERS app has the potential 
to scale measurement-based peer supervision to facilitate quality assurance of 
psychological treatments across contexts.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the effectiveness of a digital therapeutic 
intervention for individuals with alcohol use problems. Digital interventions 
are increasingly considered viable alternatives or complements to traditional 
face-to-face treatments, especially in improving accessibility and adherence.
METHODS: A total of 30 outpatients were recruited and randomly assigned to 
either a digital intervention group or a face-to-face cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) control group. After excluding two dropouts, data from 28 
participants were analyzed. The digital intervention group received a 12-week 
mobile application-based CBT program, which included 84 video-based CBT 
sessions. The control group received an 8-session standardized face-to-face CBT 
program over the same period. Both groups were also provided with a mobile 
application that included a diary feature for tracking alcohol consumption, 
cravings, and mood. Assessments were conducted at baseline, mid-treatment (week 
4), and post-treatment (week 12) to evaluate risky drinking, craving, readiness 
for change, depression, anxiety, and alcohol-related symptoms.
RESULTS: The primary outcome, abstinence rate during weeks 9-12, was 
significantly higher in the digital intervention group (73.3%) compared to the 
control group (30.8%). Regarding secondary outcomes, the digital group showed 
significantly greater reductions in risky drinking, craving, and anxiety levels 
compared to the control group. However, no significant group differences were 
found for other outcome variables.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that digital CBT-based interventions can be 
an effective alternative to face-to-face CBT for reducing alcohol use and 
related symptoms. The study highlights the potential of digital therapeutics in 
addiction treatment, while acknowledging limitations such as small sample size 
and short follow-up period. Future research should explore long-term effects and 
broader clinical applicability.

AIM: To evaluate the impact of a psychoeducational, mobile health intervention 
based on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness-based approaches on the 
mental health of healthcare workers at the frontline against COVID-19 in Spain.
DESIGN: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomized, parallel group, 
controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomized to receive the 
PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention.
METHODS: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional 
skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and 
practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended patients with COVID-19 will 
be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a 
control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will 
be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected 
telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 
2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and 
anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout 
(MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The 
study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial 
participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group 
allocation.
DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver 
mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study 
will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type 
of intervention on this specific population and context.
IMPACT: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, 
mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because 
of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help 
health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the 
development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them 
pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also 
empirical data about its benefits.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Problematic smartphone use (PSU) has emerged as a growing 
public health concern, with increasing evidence linking it to mental health 
issues such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. While smartphones 
offer numerous benefits, excessive use can contribute to cognitive overload, 
emotional distress, and behavioral addiction. This review aims to explore the 
burden of PSU, its psychological and neurobiological mediating factors, and 
potential prevention and intervention strategies.
METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted using relevant studies from 
PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Articles were selected based on their 
relevance to PSU and its associations with mental health conditions, including 
depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Both theoretical and empirical studies were 
included to provide a broad perspective on the topic.
RESULTS: Findings indicate that PSU is associated with increased stress, 
anxiety, depression, and sleep disruptions. The mechanisms underlying these 
associations include dopaminergic dysregulation, social comparison, Fear of 
Missing Out, cognitive overload, and poor sleep hygiene. Various interventions, 
such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, digital detox programs, and smartphone 
usage tracking applications, have been proposed to mitigate the negative impact 
of PSU.
CONCLUSION: PSU is a significant risk factor for mental health disturbances, 
particularly among adolescents and young adults. Addressing PSU requires a 
multi-faceted approach involving behavioral interventions, public awareness 
initiatives, and policy regulations. Further research is needed to assess the 
long-term effectiveness of existing interventions and to develop tailored 
strategies for reducing smartphone overuse and its psychological consequences.

OBJECTIVE: The current multicentre randomized controlled trial assessed the 
clinical efficacy of a combined mHealth intervention for eating disorders (EDs) 
based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
METHOD: A total of 106 ED patients from eight different public and private 
mental health services in Spain were randomly assigned to two parallel groups. 
Patients of the experimental group (N = 53) received standard face-to-face CBT 
plus a mobile intervention through an application called "TCApp," which provides 
self-monitoring and an online chat with the therapist. The control group (N = 
53) received standard face-to-face CBT only. Patients completed self-report 
questionnaires on ED symptomatology, anxiety, depression, and quality of life, 
before and after treatment.
RESULTS: Significant reductions in primary and secondary outcomes were observed 
for participants of both groups, with no differences between groups. Results 
also suggested that the frequency with which patients attended their referral 
mental health institution after the intervention was lower for patients in the 
experimental group than for those in the control group.
DISCUSSION: The current study showed that CBT can help to reduce symptoms 
relating to ED, regardless of whether its delivery includes online components in 
addition to traditional face-to-face treatment. Besides, the additional 
component offered by the TCApp does not appear to be promising from a purely 
therapeutic perspective but perhaps as a cost-effective tool, reducing thus the 
costs and time burden associated with weekly visits to health professionals.

Introduction: Depression is highly prevalent and often accompanied by comorbid 
anxiety disorder. Internet-based interventions have shown to be one effective 
treatment modality; however, comorbidities are often not targeted. 
Transdiagnostic tailored internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) might be 
promising to overcome such issues. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the 
efficacy, moderators, and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic tailored 
internet- and mobile-based guided intervention for depression and comorbid 
anxiety in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Two-hundred 
participants with MDD will be randomly assigned to an 8-week guided self-help 
internet intervention (IC) or a 6-month wait-list control group (WLC). 
Participants of the IC will receive weekly content-focused feedback on module 
completion as well as monitored adherence reminders from an eCoach. The primary 
outcome is clinician-rated depression severity (QIDS-C) at post-assessment 
assessed by diagnostic raters blind to study condition. Secondary outcomes 
include, e.g., change in diagnostic status (MDD and anxiety disorders), 
remission and response rates, disorder symptom severity, health related quality 
of life, incongruence related to needs and values, and behavioral activation. 
Assessments will take place at baseline (T1), post-assessment (T2), 6-month 
follow-up (T3), and 12-month follow-up in the IC. Data will be analyzed on an 
intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. A large number of a priori defined 
moderators of treatment outcome will be assessed at baseline and tested in 
predicting treatment outcome. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from a 
societal perspective. Discussion: The present study will provide evidence on the 
efficacy, potential cost-effectiveness, and moderators of a transdiagnostic 
tailored guided internet- and mobile-based treatment protocol.

BACKGROUND: Although psychological interventions for stress relief, such as 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction 
(MBSR), have been developed, they have not been widely used in treating 
depression. The use of mobile devices can increase the possibility of actual use 
by integrating interventions and reducing the difficulty and cost burden of 
treatment application. This study aims to determine whether "inMind," an 
integrated mobile application for stress reduction, developed for the general 
population, decreases stress for patients with mild to moderate major depressive 
disorder during the pharmacological treatment period.
METHODS: This study is a single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled 
crossover trial. The App, developed in Republic of Korea, provides integrated 
interventions for stress reduction for the general population through three 
modules based on mindfulness-based stress reduction, cognitive behavior therapy, 
and relaxation sounds that are known to be effective in stress reduction 
("meditation," "cognitive approach," and "relaxation sounds," respectively). 
Participants (n = 215) recruited via medical practitioner referral will be 
randomized to an App first group (fAPP) or a wait list crossover group (dAPP). 
The study will be conducted over 8 weeks; the fAPP group will use the App for 
the first 4 weeks and the dAPP group for the next 4 weeks. During all study 
periods, participants will receive their usual pharmacological treatment. The 
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 is the primary outcome measure. The analysis 
will employ repeated measurements using a mixed-model approach.
DISCUSSION: The App can potentially be an important addition to depression 
treatment because of its applicability and the comprehensive nature of the 
interventions that covers diverse stress-relieving models.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health apps are proving to be an important tool for 
increasing access to psychological therapies early on, particularly with rising 
rates of anxiety and depression in young people.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usability, acceptability, safety, and 
effectiveness of a new app, Clear Fear, developed to help young people manage 
symptoms of anxiety using the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy.
METHODS: The Clear Fear app was developed to provide cognitive behavioral 
strategies to suit anxiety disorders. An uncontrolled pre- and post-follow-up 
design over a 9-week period was used to assess the app and its effects. This 
study comprised 3 phases: baseline (stage 1), post-app familiarization phase 
(stage 2), and follow-up (stage 3). Eligible participants were aged between 16 
and 25 years with mild to moderate anxiety but not currently receiving treatment 
or in contact with specialist mental health services or using other 
interventions or apps to help monitor or manage their mental health. A community 
sample was recruited via advertisements, relevant websites, and social media 
networks. Eligible participants completed standardized self-report tools and 
questionnaires at each study stage. These measured probable symptoms of anxiety 
(7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale) and depression (Mood and Feelings 
Questionnaire); emotional and behavioral difficulties (Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire); and feedback on the usability, accessibility, and 
safety of the app. Mean scores at baseline and follow-up were compared using 
paired 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Qualitative data derived 
from open-ended questions were coded and entered into NVivo (version 10) for 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 48 young people entered the study at baseline, with 37 (77%) 
completing all outcome measures at follow-up. The sample was mostly female 
(37/48, 77%). The mean age was 20.1 (SD 2.1) years. In total, 48% (23/48) of the 
participants reached the threshold for probable anxiety disorder, 56% (27/48) 
had positive scores for probable depression, and 75% (36/48) obtained a total 
score of "very high" on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for 
emotional and behavioral difficulties. The app was well received, offering 
reassurance, practical and immediate help to manage symptoms, and encouragement 
to seek help, and was generally found easy to use. A small minority (3/48, 6%) 
found the app difficult to navigate. The Clear Fear app resulted in 
statistically significant reductions in probable symptoms of anxiety (t36=2.6, 
95% CI 0.41-3.53; P=.01) and depression (z=2.3; P=.02) and behavioral and 
emotional difficulties (t47=4.5, 95% CI 3.67-9.65; P<.001), representing mostly 
medium to large standardized effect sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: The Clear Fear app was found to be usable, acceptable, safe, and 
effective in helping manage symptoms of anxiety and depression and emotional and 
behavioral difficulties.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether adding mobile application coaching and 
patient/provider web portals to community primary care compared with standard 
diabetes management would reduce glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with 
type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cluster-randomized clinical trial, the Mobile 
Diabetes Intervention Study, randomly assigned 26 primary care practices to one 
of three stepped treatment groups or a control group (usual care). A total of 
163 patients were enrolled and included in analysis. The primary outcome was 
change in glycated hemoglobin levels over a 1-year treatment period. Secondary 
outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, 
depression, and other clinical (blood pressure) and laboratory (lipid) values. 
Maximal treatment was a mobile- and web-based self-management patient coaching 
system and provider decision support. Patients received automated, real-time 
educational and behavioral messaging in response to individually analyzed blood 
glucose values, diabetes medications, and lifestyle behaviors communicated by 
mobile phone. Providers received quarterly reports summarizing patient's 
glycemic control, diabetes medication management, lifestyle behaviors, and 
evidence-based treatment options.
RESULTS: The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were 1.9% in the maximal 
treatment group and 0.7% in the usual care group, a difference of 1.2% (P = 
0.001) [corrected] over 12 months. Appreciable differences were not observed 
between groups for patient-reported diabetes distress, depression, diabetes 
symptoms, or blood pressure and lipid levels (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood glucose 
data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually 
analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines to providers substantially 
reduced glycated hemoglobin levels over 1 year.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has introduced 
additional pressures on an already fragile mental health care system due to a 
significant rise in depression, anxiety, and stress among Canadians. Although 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment to 
reduce such mental health issues, few people have access to CBT in an engaging 
and sustainable manner. To address this gap, a collaboration between the Centre 
for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the National Research Council of 
Canada (NRC) developed CBT-based self-led, online, clinician-tested modules in 
the form of a video game, named Legend of Evelys, and evaluated its usability in 
the attenuation of a COVID-19-related increase in stress.
OBJECTIVE: We here present the conceptualization and design of new self-care 
modules in the form of a video game, its implementation in a technological 
infrastructure, and inclusivity and privacy considerations that informed the 
development. A usability study of the modules was performed to assess the video 
game's usability, user engagement, and user perceptions.
METHODS: The development of the video game involved establishment of a 
technology infrastructure for secure implementation of the software for the 
modules and a clinician-led assessment of the clinical utility of these modules 
through two "whiteboard" sessions. The usability study was informed by a mixed 
methods sequential explanatory design to evaluate the intervention of the mobile 
app through two distinct phases: quantitative data collection using in-app 
analytics data and two surveys, followed by qualitative data collection by 
semistructured interviews.
RESULTS: A total of 32 participants trialed the app for 2 weeks. They used the 
video game an average of six times and rated the game as "good" based on the 
Systems Usability Scale score. In terms of stress reduction, the study 
demonstrated a significant difference in the participants' Perceived Stress 
Scale score at baseline (mean 22.14, SD 6.187) compared with that at the 2-week 
follow-up (mean 18.04, SD 6.083; t27=3.628, P=.001). Qualitative interviews 
helped participants identify numerous functionality issues and provided specific 
recommendations, most of which were successfully integrated into the video game 
for future release.
CONCLUSIONS: Through this collaboration, we have established that it is possible 
to incorporate CBT exercises into a video game and have these exercises adopted 
to address stress. While video games are a promising strategy to help people 
with their stress and anxiety, there is a further need to examine the real-world 
effectiveness of the Legend of Evelys in reducing anxiety.

BACKGROUND: Excessive stress is a major global health concern, particularly in 
young adults. Short skills-focused self-guided interventions (SGIs) on 
smartphones are a scalable way to improve stress-coping skills at the population 
level.
OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to examine the possible 
efficacy of a recently developed stress-coping SGI (Intellect) in improving 
psychological distress, relative to an active control group and 2 potential 
moderators of this predicted relationship (ie, psychological mindedness [PM] and 
coping self-efficacy [CSE]).
METHODS: University students (N=321) were randomly assigned to either an 8-day 
SGI on stress-coping or an active control group. Self-reported measures were 
obtained at baseline, after the intervention, and at the 1-month follow-up. The 
primary outcome was psychological stress (Psychological Stress Measure-9). 
Secondary outcomes were anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depressive 
symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). PM and CSE were assessed as potential 
moderators at baseline.
RESULTS: The final sample (n=264) included 188 (71.2%) female, 66 (25%) male, 7 
(2.7%) nonbinary, and 3 (1.1%) others participants with a mean age of 22.5 (SD 
5.41) years. The intervention group reported significantly lower perceived 
stress (partial eta-squared [ηp2]=0.018; P=.03) and anxiety (ηp2=0.019; P=.03) 
levels after intervention relative to the active control group. The effects on 
perceived stress levels remained statistically significant at the 1-month 
follow-up (ηp2=0.015; P=.05). Students with the lowest CSE and highest PM 
experienced the fastest decline in perceived stress levels (β=6.37, 95% Cl 
2.98-9.75). Improvements in anxiety levels were not observed at 1-month 
follow-up. Similarly, no intervention effects were found for depression levels 
at postintervention and follow-up periods.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the Intellect stress-coping SGI 
is effective in reducing perceived stress and anxiety levels among university 
students. Mobile health apps are brief, scalable, and can make important 
contributions to public mental health.

BACKGROUND: Smartphones could enhance access to effective cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT). Users may frequently and flexibly access bite-size CBT content on 
personal devices, review and practice skills, and thereby achieve better 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the distribution of actual interactions participants had 
with therapeutic content in a trial of smartphone CBT for depression and whether 
interactions were within assigned treatment modules or revisits to prior module 
content (ie, between-module interactions).
METHODS: We examined the association between the number of within- and 
between-module interactions and baseline and end-of-treatment symptom severity 
during an 8-week, single-arm open trial of a therapist-guided CBT for depression 
mobile health app.
RESULTS: Interactions were more frequent early in treatment and modestly 
declined in later stages. Within modules, most participants consistently made 
more interactions than required to progress to the next module and tended to 
return to all types of content rather than focus on 1 skill. By contrast, only 
15 of 26 participants ever revisited prior module content (median number of 
revisits=1, mode=0, IQR 0-4). More revisits were associated with more severe 
end-of-treatment symptom severity after controlling for pretreatment symptom 
severity (P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the frequency of use is an insufficient 
metric of engagement, lacking the nuance of what users are engaging with and 
when during treatment. This lens is essential for developing personalized 
recommendations and yielding better treatment outcomes.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious to treat depression, however 
more research is needed to understand its functions among Latinxs. This study 
analyzed qualitative responses that were paired with a mood rating (1-9 scale) 
from daily ecological momentary assessments via text-messaging of 52 low-income, 
Spanish-speaking patients to assess the relationship between word use and 
changes in mood during group CBT. Based on previous research, we chose 11 
linguistic dimensions from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis 
software that conceptually related to core CBT treatment elements and 
sociocultural factors of depression in Latinxs. Results showed that the use of 
words from the categories of Friends, Religion, Positive Emotions, and Leisure 
(proxy for behavioral activation) were significantly associated with a 
significant increase in mood. The use of Negative Emotions and Health words were 
significantly associated with a significant decrease in mood. Post-hoc analysis 
revealed that Certainty (proxy for cognitive inflexibility) words were related 
to a significant decrease in mood when Negative Emotional words were present. 
Findings contribute to our understanding of the role of sociocultural factors 
and core CBT elements in changes in mood among Latinxs. Lastly, this paper 
demonstrates the potential for analyzing language content during a digital 
health intervention to better understand user experiences.

BACKGROUND: Primary headaches, including migraine and tension-type headaches, 
are widespread and have a social, physical, mental, and economic impact. Among 
the key components of treatment are behavior interventions such as lifestyle 
modification. Scalable conversational agents (CAs) have the potential to deliver 
behavior interventions at a low threshold. To our knowledge, there is no 
evidence of behavioral interventions delivered by CAs for the treatment of 
headaches.
OBJECTIVE: This study has 2 aims. The first aim was to develop and test a 
smartphone-based coaching intervention (BalanceUP) for people experiencing 
frequent headaches, delivered by a CA and designed to improve mental well-being 
using various behavior change techniques. The second aim was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of BalanceUP by comparing the intervention and waitlist control 
groups and assess the engagement and acceptance of participants using BalanceUP.
METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, adults with frequent 
headaches were recruited on the web and in collaboration with experts and 
allocated to either a CA intervention (BalanceUP) or a control condition. The 
effects of the treatment on changes in the primary outcome of the study, that 
is, mental well-being (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety 
and Depression Scale), and secondary outcomes (eg, psychosomatic symptoms, 
stress, headache-related self-efficacy, intention to change behavior, 
presenteeism and absenteeism, and pain coping) were analyzed using linear mixed 
models and Cohen d. Primary and secondary outcomes were self-assessed before and 
after the intervention, and acceptance was assessed after the intervention. 
Engagement was measured during the intervention using self-reports and usage 
data.
RESULTS: A total of 198 participants (mean age 38.7, SD 12.14 y; n=172, 86.9% 
women) participated in the study (intervention group: n=110; waitlist control 
group: n=88). After the intervention, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed 
evidence for improved well-being (treatment: β estimate=-3.28, 95% CI -5.07 to 
-1.48) with moderate between-group effects (Cohen d=-0.66, 95% CI -0.99 to 
-0.33) in favor of the intervention group. We also found evidence of reduced 
somatic symptoms, perceived stress, and absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as 
improved headache management self-efficacy, application of behavior change 
techniques, and pain coping skills, with effects ranging from medium to large 
(Cohen d=0.43-1.05). Overall, 64.8% (118/182) of the participants used coaching 
as intended by engaging throughout the coaching and completing the outro.
CONCLUSIONS: BalanceUP was well accepted, and the results suggest that coaching 
delivered by a CA can be effective in reducing the burden of people who 
experience headaches by improving their well-being.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain often experience coexisting, long-term 
and debilitating mental health comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. 
Artificial intelligence-supported cognitive behavioral therapy (AI-CBT) 
interventions could offer cost-effective, accessible, and potentially effective 
resources to address this problem. However, there is not enough research 
conducted about the efficacy of AI-CBT interventions for chronic pain.
OBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study aims to examine the efficacy and use of 
an AI-CBT intervention for chronic pain (Wysa for Chronic Pain app, Wysa Inc) 
using a conversational agent (with no human intervention). To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first such study for chronic pain using a 
fully-automated, free-text-based conversational agent.
METHODS: Participants with self-reported chronic pain (n=500) will be recruited 
online on a rolling basis from April 2022 through posts on US-based internet 
communities within this prospective cohort. Informed consent is received from 
participants within the app, and the Wysa for Chronic Pain intervention is 
delivered remotely for 8 weeks. Outcome measures including a numeric pain rating 
scale and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Pain 
Interference, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
questionnaires administered to test the effectiveness of the intervention on 
reducing levels of pain interference, depression, and anxiety. The therapeutic 
alliance created with the conversational agent will be assessed through the 
Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised instrument. Retention and use 
statistics will be observed for adherence and engagement.
RESULTS: The study will open for recruitment in April 2022, and data collection 
is expected to be completed by August 2022. The results for the primary outcomes 
are expected to be published by late 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: Mental health conversational agents driven by artificial 
intelligence could be effective in helping patients with chronic pain learn to 
self-manage their pain and common comorbidities like depression and anxiety. The 
Wysa for Chronic Pain app is one such digital intervention that can potentially 
serve as a solution to the problems of affordability and scalability associated 
with interventions that include a human therapist. This prospective study 
examines the efficacy of the app as a treatment solution for chronic pain. It 
aims to inform future practices and digital mental health interventions for 
individuals with chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems 
that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can 
also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance 
during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used 
to treat major depressive disorder.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical 
feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a 
mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary 
intervention and context sensing.
METHODS: We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in 
which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients' mood, emotions, 
cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social 
context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global 
positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback 
graphs illustrating correlations between patients' self-reported states, as well 
as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief 
telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We 
enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to 
receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by learners 
predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on 
scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied 
with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported 
depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) 
and interview measures of depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.81, P < .001, 
per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet 
criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (b(week) = -.65, P = .03, 
per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased 
(beta(week) = -.71, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58).
CONCLUSIONS: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary 
evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary 
intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to 
use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons 
learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development 
process are discussed.

Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 
United States.

BACKGROUND: To date, we are aware of no interventions for anxiety and depression 
developed as mobile phone apps and tailored to young sexual minority men, a 
group especially at risk of anxiety and depression. We developed TODAY!, a 
culturally informed mobile phone intervention for young men who are attracted to 
men and who have clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression. The 
core of the intervention consists of daily psychoeducation informed by 
transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a set of tools to 
facilitate putting these concepts into action, with regular mood ratings that 
result in tailored feedback (eg, tips for current distress and visualizations of 
mood by context).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct usability testing to understand 
how young sexual minority men interact with the app, to inform later stages of 
intervention development.
METHODS: Participants (n=9) were young sexual minority men aged 18-20 years 
(Mean=19.00, standard deviation [SD]=0.71; 44% black, 44% white, and 11.1% 
Latino), who endorsed at least mild depression and anxiety symptoms. 
Participants were recruited via flyers, emails to college lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations, Web-based advertisements, 
another researcher's database of sexual minority youth interested in research 
participation, and word of mouth. During recorded interviews, participants were 
asked to think out loud while interacting with the TODAY! app on a mobile phone 
or with paper prototypes. Feedback identified from these recordings and from 
associated field notes were subjected to thematic analysis using a general 
inductive approach. To aid interpretation of results, methods and results are 
reported according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative 
research (COREQ).
RESULTS: Thematic analysis of usability feedback revealed a theme of general 
positive feedback, as well as six recurring themes that informed continued 
development: (1) functionality (eg, highlight new material when available), (2) 
personalization (eg, more tailored feedback), (3) presentation (eg, keep content 
brief), (4) aesthetics (eg, use brighter colors), (5) LGBT or youth content (eg, 
add content about coming out), and (6) barriers to use (eg, perceiving 
psychoeducation as homework).
CONCLUSIONS: Feedback from usability testing was vital to understanding what 
young sexual minority men desire from a mobile phone intervention for symptoms 
of anxiety and depression and was used to inform the ongoing development of such 
an intervention.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition marked by widespread pain, 
psychological distress, and significant societal costs. This study evaluates the 
feasibility of a mobile health (mHealth) application designed to support 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for FM by enabling real-time tracking of 
patient-reported outcomes and adaptive treatment modifications within public 
health care settings. Thirty-six adults with FM participated in this feasibility 
study, which assessed the app's usability, acceptability, and clinical utility 
for both patients and therapists. Results demonstrated high usability ratings 
(87.63 for patients, 88.75 for therapists) and adherence rates (67.9 percent of 
requested evaluations completed), confirming the app's practicality and 
engagement potential. The app generated 1,348 clinical alarms during the 
intervention, providing actionable insights that allowed therapists to tailor 
treatments dynamically. This study highlights the role of mHealth technologies 
in enhancing psychological care through data-driven, real-time monitoring, and 
treatment personalization. Small but notable reductions in depression levels 
underscore the app's potential to improve psychological outcomes. By fostering 
engagement and facilitating personalized care, this approach advances the 
integration of digital health tools in chronic disease management, offering a 
scalable model for enhancing behavioral interventions in public health systems.

Scalable solutions to treat depression in older adults in low-resourced settings 
are urgently needed. The PRODIGITAL-D pragmatic, single-blind, two-arm, 
individually randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a mobile 
messaging psychosocial intervention in improving depressive symptomatology among 
older adults in socioeconomically deprived areas of Guarulhos, Brazil. Older 
adults (aged 60+ years) registered with 24 primary care clinics and identified 
with depressive symptomatology (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 
scores ≥ 10) received the 6-week Viva Vida intervention based on psychoeducation 
and behavioral activation (n = 298) or a single message (n = 305). No health 
professional support was offered. The primary outcome was improvement from 
depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 < 10) at 3 months. Of the 603 participants 
enrolled (mean age = 65.1 years; 451 (74.8%) women), 527 (87.4%) completed the 
follow-up assessment. In the intervention arm, 109 of 257 (42.4%) participants 
had an improved depressive symptomatology, compared with 87 of 270 (32.2%) 
participants in the control arm (adjusted odds ratio = 1.57; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.07-2.29; P = 0.019). No severe adverse events related to trial 
participation were observed. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a 
digital messaging psychosocial intervention in the short-term improvement from 
depressive symptomatology that can potentially be integrated into primary care 
programs for treating older adults with depression. Brazilian Registry of

BACKGROUND: Technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs are 
accessible interventions to address mental health challenges, particularly among 
college students. Despite their potential, low adherence rates remain a key 
challenge.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effects of the tailored content and 
gamification elements of the Mind Booster Green program on reducing depressive 
symptoms and improving college life adjustment.
METHODS: A randomized, unblinded controlled trial was conducted among college 
students. All study procedures were conducted remotely using web-based tools. 
The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control 
groups. The intervention group used Mind Booster Green, an app-based self-help 
cognitive behavioral therapy program for 1 month. The program included tailored 
case stories and gamification elements, such as point and level systems, to 
enhance user engagement and adherence. Outcomes were self-assessed using 
web-based questionnaires and included changes in depressive symptoms, college 
life adjustment, and negative and positive automatic thoughts. The usability of 
the app was also evaluated. Outcomes were measured at 3 time points: 
preintervention, postintervention, and at a 2-month follow-up (F/U), using 
validated and standardized tools.
RESULTS: A total of 170 individuals (mean age 22.60, SD 3.37 years; 136/170, 80% 
female) participated in the study. A chi-square analysis revealed no significant 
differences between the two groups at baseline in terms of age, sex, or class 
year (P>.05). A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed significant 
time×group interactions for all variables. Compared to the control group, the 
intervention group showed greater improvements across all outcomes, with 
between-group effect sizes ranging from -0.78 to 0.49. For derpessive symptoms, 
large within-group effect size were observed (Patient Health Questionnaire-9: 
pre to post, Cohen d=1.12; pre to F/U, Cohen d=1.15; Beck Depression 
Inventory-II: pre to post, Cohen d=0.90; pre to F/U, Cohen d=1.04). Large 
within-group effect size was also found for adjustment to college life (Student 
Adaptation to College Questionnaire-Revised: pre to post, Cohen d=-0.87; pre to 
F/U, Cohen d=-0.85), and moderate effect for negative automatic thoughts 
(Automatic Thought Questionnaire-Negative, Short Form: pre to post, Cohen 
d=0.36; pre to F/U, Cohen d=0.58) and positive automatic thoughts (Automatic 
Thought Questionnaire-Positive, Short Form: pre to post, Cohen d=-0.45; pre to 
F/U, Cohen d=-0.44). Adherence rates were 89% and 99% for the intervention and 
control groups, respectively. The usability test results, assessed using the 
Mobile App Rating Scale, showed an overall score of 3.88, with scores above the 
medium level in the engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information 
quality categories.
CONCLUSIONS: Mind Booster Green demonstrated substantial potential as a 
complementary interventio to traditional psychological services for college 
students, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for mental health 
issues. Future research should explore the applicability of this program in 
diverse populations.

BACKGROUND: Due to the progressive aging of the population, programs to promote 
active aging have been recommended. However, older adults have difficulty 
accessing them. Interventions administered through online video games may 
increase their accessibility, and complementing these with a smartphone app will 
likely increase adherence and allow for ongoing professional monitoring. The 
objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral 
intervention for active aging administered through an online interactive 
multimedia video game that includes a smartphone app companion. The secondary 
objectives are to analyze the moderators and mediators of the change in the 
outcome variables and to evaluate the adherence to the intervention.
METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Adults 
45 years and older will be randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral 
intervention administered through an online multimedia video game that includes 
a smartphone app companion or to a control group that will receive online 
information on active aging (274 participants per group). The intervention will 
be administered in eight weekly 45-min modules. An investigator-blinded 
evaluation will be conducted using online self-administered tests at baseline, 
post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome will be 
mental health status as evaluated using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-36) at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes will be emotional well-being, 
depressive symptoms, reinforcement, negative thoughts, self-reported memory, 
cognitive task performance, sleep hygiene behaviors, physical activity, eating 
habits, body mass index, social support, dropout, treatment adherence, and 
satisfaction with the intervention.
DISCUSSION: If the results are favorable, this study would involve the 
development of the first evidence-based active aging promotion intervention 
based on a video game that includes a smartphone app companion, providing 
evidence on its efficacy, accessibility, and clinical utility.

Mobile mental health interventions have the potential to reduce barriers and 
increase engagement in psychotherapy. However, most current tools fail to meet 
evidence-based principles. In this paper, we describe data-driven design 
implications for translating evidence-based interventions into mobile apps. To 
develop these design implications, we analyzed data from a month-long field 
study of an app designed to support dialectical behavioral therapy, a 
psychotherapy that aims to teach concrete coping skills to help people better 
manage their mental health. We investigated whether particular skills are more 
or less effective in reducing distress or emotional intensity. We also 
characterized how an individual's disorders, characteristics, and preferences 
may correlate with skill effectiveness, as well as how skill-level improvements 
correlate with study-wide changes in depressive symptoms. We then developed a 
model to predict skill effectiveness. Based on our findings, we present design 
implications that emphasize the importance of considering different 
environmental, emotional, and personal contexts. Finally, we discuss promising 
future opportunities for mobile apps to better support evidence-based 
psychotherapies, including using machine learning algorithms to develop 
personalized and context-aware skill recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation is a pen and paper-based therapy form for 
treating depression. The patient registers their activity hourly, and together 
with the therapist, they agree on a plan to change behavior. However, with the 
limited clinical personnel, and a growing patient population, new methods are 
needed to advance behavioral activation.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper were to (1) automatically identify 
behavioral patterns through statistical analysis of the paper-based activity 
diaries, and (2) determine whether it is feasible to move the behavioral 
activation therapy format to a digital solution.
METHODS: We collected activity diaries from seven patients with bipolar 
depression, covering in total 2,480 hours of self-reported activities. A 
pleasure score, on a 1-10 rating scale, was reported for each activity. The 
activities were digitalized into 6 activity categories, and statistical analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: Across all patients, movement-related activities were associated with 
the highest pleasure score followed by social activities. On an individual 
level, through a nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, one patient had a 
statistically significant larger amount of spare time activities when feeling 
bad (z=-2.045, P=.041). Through a within-subject analysis of covariance, the 
patients were found to have a better day than the previous, if that previous day 
followed their diurnal rhythm (ρ=.265, P=.029). Furthermore, a second-order 
trend indicated that two hours of daily social activity was optimal for the 
patients (β2=-0.08, t (63)=-1.22, P=.23).
CONCLUSIONS: The data-driven statistical approach was able to find patterns 
within the behavioral traits that could assist the therapist in as well as help 
design future technologies for behavioral activation.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death and disability 
worldwide, associated with numerous acute and chronic medical conditions. 
Digital health interventions offer a promising solution to overcome barriers 
associated with traditional treatment methods, providing accessible, scalable, 
and cost-effective means to support individuals in reducing hazardous drinking.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of the Sober smartphone app in individuals with hazardous 
alcohol use.
METHODS: This single-group, pre- and postpilot study included 20 participants 
with risky alcohol use, identified using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification 
Test. Participants used the Sober app for 4 weeks, incorporating cognitive 
behavioral therapy-based interventions. Feasibility was assessed by study and 
session completion rates, acceptability by participant satisfaction and 
perceived usefulness, and preliminary efficacy by changes in alcohol consumption 
and psychiatric symptoms. Semistructured interviews with participants and 
clinicians provided qualitative perspectives on the app's usability, efficacy, 
and areas for improvement.
RESULTS: Of the 20 enrolled participants, 17 completed the study. The app 
demonstrated high feasibility with an 85% (17/20) study completion rate, and 59% 
(10/17) completed all cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. Participants 
reported positive acceptability, with average satisfaction and usefulness 
ratings of 3.8 and 3.7 of 5, respectively. Preliminary efficacy outcomes showed 
significant improvements: abstinence days increased from 67% to 85% (z=-3.17; 
P=.002), heavy drinking episodes decreased from 3.3 to 1.9 (t16=-2.97; P=.003), 
and total alcohol consumption reduced from 456.8 to 195.9 mL (t16=3.16; P=.002). 
Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores dropped from 17.5 to 10.7 
(t16=4.51; P<.001). Additionally, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) 
scores decreased from 5.8 to 4.4 (t16=2.91; P=.01), and anxiety (Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7) scores from 3.4 to 2.1 (z=-2.80; P=.005). No adverse events 
were reported. Qualitative analysis found participants valued daily logging but 
noted usability issues, while clinicians called for tailored goals, enhanced 
communication features, and age-specific content.
CONCLUSIONS: The mobile app Sober shows promise as an effective tool for 
reducing hazardous alcohol consumption and improving related psychiatric 
symptoms. The study demonstrated high feasibility and positive acceptability, 
with significant preliminary efficacy in reducing alcohol use. Qualitative 
findings provided actionable evidence for refining the app's usability and 
clinical integration. Further research through a randomized controlled trial is 
warranted to confirm these findings and optimize the app's features and content.

A minority of bereaved adults experiences prolonged grief disorder, depression, 
and/or posttraumatic stress disorder, with heightened risks observed among 
bereaved parents. Cognitive-behavioural therapies, both face-to-face and online, 
have demonstrated efficacy in treating post-loss mental health problems. Mobile 
phone applications potentially offer an efficient and cost-effective way to 
deliver self-help to bereaved adults, yet controlled effectiveness studies are 
lacking. Therefore, we examined the short-term efficacy of the My Grief app, 
based on cognitive-behavioural therapy, in 248 bereaved parents, in a randomised 
controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT04552717). Participants 
were randomly allocated to access to the My Grief app (n = 126) or a waitlist 
(n = 122). At baseline and post-assessment, symptoms of prolonged grief, 
posttraumatic stress, and depression, negative grief cognitions, rumination, and 
avoidance were assessed. Reductions in prolonged grief and posttraumatic stress 
symptoms and negative cognitions in the intervention group were larger than in 
the control group, albeit with small effect sizes. Fifteen app users reported 
negative experiences with the app; for example, some mentioned that it elicited 
painful memories and emotions related to their loss. My Grief appears to achieve 
modest improvements in mental health in bereaved parents. Given that it is 
accessible and low-cost, it is an important addition to the suite of prolonged 
grief interventions.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and mood disorders are the most common mental illnesses, 
peaking during adolescence and affecting approximately 25% of Canadians aged 
14-17 years. If not successfully treated at this age, they often persist into 
adulthood, exerting a great social and economic toll. Given the long-term 
impact, finding ways to increase the success and cost-effectiveness of mental 
health care is a pressing need. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an 
evidence-based treatment for mood and anxiety disorders throughout the lifespan. 
Mental health technologies can be used to make such treatments more successful 
by delivering them in a format that increases utilization. Young people embrace 
technologies, and many want to actively manage their mental health. Mobile 
software apps have the potential to improve youth adherence to CBT and, in turn, 
improve outcomes of treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to improve homework adherence in CBT 
for youth anxiety and/or depression. The objectives are to (1) design and 
optimize the usability of a mobile app for delivering the homework component of 
CBT for youth with anxiety and/or depression, (2) assess the app's impact on 
homework completion, and (3) implement the app in CBT programs. We hypothesize 
that homework adherence will be greater in the app group than in the no-app 
group.
METHODS: Phase 1: exploratory interviews will be conducted with adolescents and 
therapists familiar with CBT to obtain views and perspectives on the 
requirements and features of a usable app and the challenges involved in 
implementation. The information obtained will guide the design of a prototype. 
The prototype will be optimized via think-aloud procedures involving an 
iterative process of evaluation, modification, and re-evaluation, culminating in 
a fully functional version of the prototype that is ready for optimization in a 
clinical context. Phase 2: a usability study will be conducted to optimize the 
prototype in the context of treatment at clinics that provide CBT treatment for 
youth with anxiety and/or depression. This phase will result in a usable app 
that is ready to be tested for its effectiveness in increasing homework 
adherence. Phase 3: a pragmatic clinical trial will be conducted at several 
clinics to evaluate the impact of the app on homework adherence. Participants in 
the app group are expected to show greater homework completion than those in the 
no-app group.
RESULTS: Phase 3 will be completed by September 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The app will be a unique adjunct to treatment for adolescents in 
CBT, focusing on both anxiety and depression, developed in partnership with end 
users at every stage from design to implementation, customizable for different 
cognitive profiles, and designed with depression symptom tracking measures for 
youth made interoperable with electronic medical records.

BACKGROUND: Youth in general and college life in particular are characterized by 
new educational, vocational, and interpersonal challenges, opportunities, and 
substantial stress. It is estimated that 30-50% of university students meet 
criteria for some mental disorder, especially depression, in any given year. The 
university has traditionally provided many channels to promote students' mental 
health, but until now only a minority have sought such help, possibly owing to 
lack of time and/or to stigma related to mental illness. Smartphone-delivered 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) shows promise for its accessibility and 
effectiveness. However, its most effective components and for whom it is more 
(or less) effective are not known.
METHODS/DESIGN: Based on the multiphase optimization strategy framework, this 
study is a parallel-group, multicenter, open, fully factorial trial examining 
five smartphone-delivered CBT components (self-monitoring, cognitive 
restructuring, behavioral activation, assertion training, and problem solving) 
among university students with elevated distress, defined as scoring 5 or more 
on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The primary outcome is change in 
PHQ-9 scores from baseline to week 8. We will estimate specific efficacy of the 
five components and their interactions through the mixed-effects 
repeated-measures analysis and propose the most effective and efficacious 
combinations of components. Effect modification by selected baseline 
characteristics will be examined in exploratory analyses.
DISCUSSION: The highly efficient experimental design will allow identification 
of the most effective components and the most efficient combinations thereof 
among the five components of smartphone CBT for university students. 
Pragmatically, the findings will help make the most efficacious CBT package 
accessible to a large number of distressed university students at reduced cost; 
theoretically, they will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of CBT and help 
further advance CBT for depression.

Mobile health apps increase the accessibility of cognitive-behavioral-based 
interventions before, during, or following treatment. GGOC is a mobile app 
designed to challenge maladaptive beliefs in obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD). This single-case study assesses the usefulness of GGOC as a relapse 
prevention tool for OCD. The patient was a 26-year-old woman with severe 
contamination and washing/cleaning OCD symptoms (Y-BOCS = 33). GGOC was used for 
relapse prevention following CBT treatment. The patient completed 47 levels 
dedicated to OCD-relevant maladaptive beliefs. Before and after GGOC, the 
Y-BOCS, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI-R), Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire 
(OBQ-20), and Depression subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale were 
completed. The OBQ-20 and OCI-R scores decreased from pre- to post-GGOC. The 
Y-BOCS decreased from 7 pre-GGOC to 2 post-GGOC. Findings support the efficacy 
of GGOC as a relapse prevention tool for individuals with OCD, and its 
contribution to maintaining gains after CBT.

BACKGROUND: A significant number of individuals with depression in Hong Kong 
remain undiagnosed and untreated through traditional face-to-face psychotherapy. 
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a tool to 
improve access to mental health services. However, iCBT remains underdeveloped 
in Chinese communities, particularly in Hong Kong.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a 
culturally and linguistically appropriate guided iCBT program for Hong Kong 
Chinese with depressive symptoms, and (2) explore their treatment adherence.
METHODS: An 11-week guided iCBT program, "Confront and Navigate Depression 
Online" (CANDO), consisting of 8 online modules, was developed and implemented 
for Hong Kong residents. The program was accessible via either an online 
platform (web-based iCBT) or a smartphone app (app-based iCBT). A 3-arm 
randomized controlled trial was conducted, with participants recruited through 
open recruitment and referrals from 2 local non-governmental organizations. A 
total of 402 eligible participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms 
were randomly allocated into 3 groups: (1) web-based iCBT (n=139); (2) app-based 
iCBT (n=131); and (3) waitlist control (WLC) group (n=132), who transitioned to 
the web-based iCBT group after waiting for 11 weeks. Therapist support was 
provided by a clinical psychologist through 3 counseling sessions and weekly 
assignment feedback. The primary outcomes were the Beck Depression Inventory-II 
(BDI-II) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the 
secondary outcome measures included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire 
(GHQ-12), the Chinese Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (CATQ), and the Chinese 
Affect Scale (CAS). These scales were administered at preintervention, 
postintervention, and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments. Data 
analysis was conducted using linear mixed effects modeling, adhering to the 
intent-to-treat principle.
RESULTS: Participants in both the web- and app-based iCBT groups reported 
significant improvements compared with the WLC group on all primary (P<.001) and 
secondary measures (P<.001 and P=.009) at posttreatment. Large between-group 
effect sizes were observed in the reduction of depressive symptoms, with Cohen's 
d value of 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.34) for the web-based group and 1.15 (95% CI 
0.88-1.43) for the app-based group on the BDI-II. Additionally, the web- and 
app-based groups showed effect sizes of 0.78 (95% CI 0.52-1.04) and 0.95 (95% CI 
0.63-1.27) on PHQ-9, respectively. Medium to large effect sizes were observed 
for secondary outcomes at posttreatment. These positive effects were maintained 
at both the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, with medium to large within-group effect 
sizes. The adherence rate in the 2 iCBT groups was 154 out of 270 (57.0%) for 
completing all 8 online modules and 152 out of 270 (56.3%) for attending all 4 
counseling sessions (including an intake interview). The recovery rate, as 
measured by the BDI-II at posttreatment, was 35 out of 90 (39%) for the 
web-based group and 36 out of 91 (40%) for the app-based group, compared with 3 
out of 112 (3%) in the WLC group.
CONCLUSIONS: Culturally and linguistically adapted iCBT is an effective and 
feasible treatment for Hong Kong Chinese with mild to moderate depressive 
symptoms, demonstrating a satisfactory recovery rate and treatment adherence. 
ICBT offers an accessible and viable alternative to face-to-face interventions 
in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government should allocate more resources and 
support the use of iCBT as a tool to treat people with depressive symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Self-help smartphone apps offer a new opportunity to address youth 
suicide prevention by improving access to support and by providing potentially 
high fidelity and cost-effective treatment. However, there have been very few 
smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this 
population. To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help 
smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young 
people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life.
OBJECTIVE: This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial 
to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and 
behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving 
general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years.
METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged 
between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention 
control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary 
outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale 
(SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, 
psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels 
of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and 
help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The 
study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of 
items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the 
potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the 
following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months 
postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the 
LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using 
linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal 
thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To 
minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical 
psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated 
email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at 
the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys.
RESULTS: The trial recruitment started in May 2020. Data collection is currently 
ongoing.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed 
smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal 
thoughts. This trial will extend knowledge about the efficacy and acceptability 
of app-based support for suicidal thoughts in young people.

Late-life depression represents a significant health concern, linked to 
disruptions in brain connectivity and immune functioning, mood regulation, and 
cognitive function. This pilot study explores a digital intervention targeting 
mental health, brain health, and immune functioning in individuals aged 55-60 
with subjective cognitive decline, elevated stress and depressive symptoms. 
Seventeen participants engaged in a two-week intervention comprising spatial 
cognition, psychological techniques based on mindfulness, attention-training 
exercises, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Pre-and post-intervention changes 
in resting-state functional connectivity, inflammation, and psychological health 
were evaluated. Key findings include: (1) Reduced self-reported depression with 
a large effect size, (2) Decreased connectivity within the default mode network 
(DMN), (3) Enhanced anticorrelation between the DMN-Salience networks that was 
associated with improved depression scores (4) Reduced salivary IL-18 
concentration with a medium effect size, correlated with decreased DMN-amygdala 
connectivity. There was a trend towards reduced anxiety, with no significant 
changes in quality of life. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
investigate the effect of digital intervention on immune markers, clinical 
behavioral outcomes, and brain function, demonstrating positive synergistic 
potential across all three levels. These preliminary findings, which need 
replication in larger, controlled studies, have important implications for basic 
science and scalable digital interventions.

BACKGROUND: Only a small fraction of individuals with pathological or 
problematic gambling seek professional help despite available evidence-based 
treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Anonymous Internet-based 
interventions may help to overcome treatment barriers. Results of a pilot study 
using an Internet-based intervention for depression in a sample of individuals 
with problematic or pathological gambling behavior show that both depressive and 
gambling-related symptomatology can be reduced with a generic depression program 
compared with a wait-list control group. Based on encouraging results of the 
pilot study, we developed a low-threshold, anonymous and cost-free online 
self-help program ("Restart") to test whether a program tailored to the needs of 
gamblers yields better results compared to the effects of the intervention 
evaluated in the pilot study. The online self-help program is based on CBT, 
targeting emotional problems and gambling-related symptoms and is accompanied by 
a smartphone application to sustain treatment benefits.
METHOD: A randomized controlled trial with two conditions (intervention group 
and wait-list control group), two assessment times (reassessment after 8 weeks) 
and a total of 136 participants is planned. The primary outcome will be change 
in pathological gambling measured with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of 
Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale from pre to post intervention. The change 
in depressive symptoms (assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 
depression module) and gambling-related dysfunctional thoughts (assessed with 
the Gambling Attitudes and Beliefs Survey) will represent secondary outcomes. 
The intervention includes modules on debt management, impulse control, 
gambling-specific cognitive biases, self-esteem, social competence, 
sleep hygiene, mindfulness and positive activities.
DISCUSSION: This study is one of the first investigations of Internet-based 
self-help programs in a sample of problematic gamblers. Self-guided 
Internet-based interventions represent a promising possibility to narrow the 
existing treatment gap while saving expensive and scarce resources (e.g., 
psychotherapists). The expected findings will add substantial knowledge in the 
development of effective Internet-based treatments for individuals with gambling 
problems. The empirical and clinical implications (e.g., broader use and 
promotion of such interventions in the future) and the limitations of the study 
will be discussed.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and common mental disorders (CMDs) 
are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Lifestyle 
interventions via mobile apps and conversational agents present themselves as 
low-cost, scalable solutions to prevent these conditions. This paper describes 
the rationale for, and development of, "LvL UP 1.0″, a smartphone-based 
lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary team led the intervention design 
process of LvL UP 1.0, involving four phases: (i) preliminary research 
(stakeholder consultations, systematic market reviews), (ii) selecting 
intervention components and developing the conceptual model, (iii) whiteboarding 
and prototype design, and (iv) testing and refinement. The Multiphase 
Optimization Strategy and the UK Medical Research Council framework for 
developing and evaluating complex interventions were used to guide the 
intervention development.
RESULTS: Preliminary research highlighted the importance of targeting holistic 
wellbeing (i.e., both physical and mental health). Accordingly, the first 
version of LvL UP features a scalable, smartphone-based, and conversational 
agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention built around three pillars: Move 
More (physical activity), Eat Well (nutrition and healthy eating), and Stress 
Less (emotional regulation and wellbeing). Intervention components include 
health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily "Life Hacks" 
(healthy activity suggestions), breathing exercises, and journaling. In addition 
to the intervention components, formative research also stressed the need to 
introduce engagement-specific components to maximise uptake and long-term use. 
LvL UP includes a motivational interviewing and storytelling approach to deliver 
the coaching sessions, as well as progress feedback and gamification. Offline 
materials are also offered to allow users access to essential intervention 
content without needing a mobile device.
CONCLUSIONS: The development process of LvL UP 1.0 led to an evidence-based and 
user-informed smartphone-based intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. 
LvL UP is designed to be a scalable, engaging, prevention-oriented, holistic 
intervention for adults at risk of NCDs and CMDs. A feasibility study, and 
subsequent optimisation and randomised-controlled trials are planned to further 
refine the intervention and establish effectiveness. The development process 
described here may prove helpful to other intervention developers.

BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions can bridge barriers in access to 
treatment among individuals with chronic pain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the perceived needs, engagement, and 
effectiveness of the mental health app Wysa with regard to mental health 
outcomes among real-world users who reported chronic pain and engaged with the 
app for support.
METHODS: Real-world data from users (N=2194) who reported chronic pain and 
associated health conditions in their conversations with the mental health app 
were examined using a mixed methods retrospective observational study. An 
inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the conversational data of users 
with chronic pain to assess perceived needs, along with comparative 
macro-analyses of conversational flows to capture engagement within the app. 
Additionally, the scores from a subset of users who completed a set of pre-post 
assessment questionnaires, namely Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (n=69) 
and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) (n=57), were examined to 
evaluate the effectiveness of Wysa in providing support for mental health 
concerns among those managing chronic pain.
RESULTS: The themes emerging from the conversations of users with chronic pain 
included health concerns, socioeconomic concerns, and pain management concerns. 
Findings from the quantitative analysis indicated that users with chronic pain 
showed significantly greater app engagement (P<.001) than users without chronic 
pain, with a large effect size (Vargha and Delaney A=0.76-0.80). Furthermore, 
users with pre-post assessments during the study period were found to have 
significant improvements in group means for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 symptom scores, 
with a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.60-0.61).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that users look for tools that can help them 
address their concerns related to mental health, pain management, and sleep 
issues. The study findings also indicate the breadth of the needs of users with 
chronic pain and the lack of support structures, and suggest that Wysa can 
provide effective support to bridge the gap.

BACKGROUND: Mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression, are 
increasingly common among adolescents. Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer a 
promising way to deliver accessible cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
interventions. However, research on the usability and effectiveness of apps 
explicitly tailored for adolescents is limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the usability, engagement, and perceived 
effectiveness of a mobile CBT app designed for adolescents, focusing on user 
experiences and mental health outcomes.
METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with 40 adolescents aged 13-19 years 
(mean age 15.8, SD 1.9 years; 18/40, 45% male; 22/40, 55% female) who engaged 
with a CBT app for 4 weeks. Mental health diagnoses included anxiety (20/40, 
50%), depression (15/40, 38%), and both (5/40, 13%). Of these, 10 (25%) of the 
40 participants had previous CBT experience. Feedback was gathered through focus 
groups and individual interviews, and thematic analysis identified key themes 
related to usability, engagement, and perceived effectiveness. Quantitative data 
on mood and anxiety scores were analyzed with paired t tests.
RESULTS: The mean usability score was 3.8 (SD 0.6), and the mean effectiveness 
score was 3.9 (SD 0.7). Older participants (aged 16-19 years) reported 
significantly higher usability (mean 4.1, SD 0.4) and effectiveness scores (mean 
4.3, SD 0.5) compared to younger participants (aged 13-15 years) (P=.03). 
Females had higher usability (mean 4, SD 0.6) and effectiveness scores (mean 
4.2, SD 0.7) than males (mean 3.6, SD 0.7, and mean 3.5, SD 0.8, respectively; 
P=.03). Participants with prior CBT experience had 2.8 times higher odds of 
reporting high usability scores (95% CI 1.6-5; P=.002) and 3.1 times higher odds 
of reporting high effectiveness scores (95% CI 1.7-5.6; P=.001). Usability 
challenges included complex navigation (20/40, 50%), interface design issues 
(12/40, 30%), and content overload (8/40, 20%). Factors positively influencing 
engagement were motivation driven by personal relevance (20/40, 50%) and 
gamification features (10/40, 25%), while lack of personalization (14/40, 35%) 
and external distractions (18/40, 45%) were significant barriers. Mood 
improvement (15/40, 38%) and learning new coping skills (12/40, 30%) were the 
most reported outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The mobile CBT app shows potential for improving adolescent mental 
health, with initial improvements in mood and anxiety. Future app iterations 
should prioritize simplifying navigation, adding personalization features, and 
enhancing technical stability to support long-term engagement.

BACKGROUND: Identifying scalable strategies for assessing fidelity is a key 
challenge in implementation science. However, for psychosocial interventions, 
the existing, reliable ways to test treatment fidelity quality are often labor 
intensive, and less burdensome strategies may not reflect actual clinical 
practice. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) provide clinicians with a set of 
effective core elements to help treat a multitude of disorders, which, evidence 
suggests, need to be delivered with fidelity to maximize potential client 
impact. The current "gold standard" for rating CBTs is rating recordings of 
therapy sessions, which is extremely time-consuming and requires a substantial 
amount of initial training. Although CBTs can vary based on the target disorder, 
one common element employed in most CBTs is the use of worksheets to identify 
specific behaviors and thoughts that affect a client's ability to recover. The 
present study will develop and evaluate an innovative new approach to rate CBT 
fidelity, by developing a universal CBT scoring system based on worksheets 
completed in therapy sessions.
METHODS: To develop a scoring system for CBT worksheets, we will compile common 
CBT elements from a variety of CBT worksheets for a range of psychiatric 
disorders and create adherence and competence measures. We will collect archival 
worksheets from past studies to test the scoring system and assess test-retest 
reliability. To evaluate whether CBT worksheet scoring accurately reflects 
clinician fidelity, we will recruit clinicians who are engaged in a CBT for 
depression, anxiety, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder. Clinicians and 
clients will transmit routine therapy materials produced in session (e.g., 
worksheets, clinical notes, session recordings) to the study team after each 
session. We will compare observer-rated fidelity, clinical notes, and 
fidelity-rated worksheets to identify the most effective and efficient method to 
assess clinician fidelity. Clients will also be randomly assigned to either 
complete the CBT worksheets on paper forms or on a mobile application (app) to 
learn if worksheet format influences clinician and client experience or differs 
in terms of reflecting fidelity.
DISCUSSION: Scoring fidelity using CBT worksheets may allow clinics to test 
fidelity in a short and effective manner, enhancing continuous quality 
improvement in the workplace. Clinicians and clinics can use such data to 
improve clinician fidelity in real time, leading to improved patient outcomes.

Many adults suffer from insomnia. Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia is 
the recommended treatment option, but access to it is not readily available. 
Digital interventions have the potential to close the treatment gap by offering 
scalable and cost-efficient options. The present randomised controlled trial 
aimed at investigating the effectiveness and safety of somnovia, an interactive 
internet-based intervention for patients with insomnia. A total of 290 
participants with chronic insomnia were randomised to intervention (n = 149) or 
the control (n = 141) condition. Participants of the intervention group received 
access to somnovia for 6 months in addition to treatment as usual, whereas 
participants in the control group only had access to treatment as usual for the 
time of the study. Online questionnaires were filled in before randomisation and 
after 3 and 6 months. The primary endpoint was the Insomnia Severity Index, with 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
Assessment-7, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale as secondary endpoints. 
After 3 months, the intervention group showed lower insomnia (Cohen's d = 0.71, 
CI = [0.44, 0.98]), depressive (Cohen's d = 0.66, CI = [0.41, 0.90]), and 
anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.56, CI = [0.32, 0.81]) symptoms, as well as improved 
overall functioning (Cohen's d = 0.50, CI = [0.24, 0.76]) compared with 
participants in the control group. The effects stayed stable after 6 months. The 
results indicate that next to a therapeutic effect on insomnia symptoms, 
somnovia might potentially help to prevent the onset of other psychiatric 
disorders such as depression and anxiety.

The high prevalence of chronic pain and comorbid depression, along with their 
negative impacts on individuals and society, highlights the need for accessible 
and effective interventions. This study examined the feasibility, efficacy, and 
acceptability of Lenio, an Internet-based self-help intervention, combined with 
the COGITO smartphone application for managing these conditions. The randomized 
controlled trial involved an intervention group (IG) using Lenio and COGITO, an 
active control group (ACG) using a transdiagnostic app, and a wait-list control 
group (WCG) receiving usual treatment. Lenio incorporates cognitive behavioral 
therapy and third-wave techniques, supported by COGITO's gamified daily 
exercises to enhance adherence. Across 263 participants assessed at three 
intervals over 16 weeks, the IG showed significant improvement in 
somatic-affective depressive symptoms compared to the WCG post-intervention and 
both control groups at follow-up. However, the ACG outperformed the IG in 
managing pain at post-intervention though these effects did not persist until 
follow-up. The interventions were well-received and feasible, with older 
participants benefiting more from the Lenio/COGITO combination. Lenio and COGITO 
could bridge gaps to conventional therapy, potentially easing pain by enhancing 
psychological well-being and coping strategies. Future studies should 
investigate tailored interventions for chronic pain and their long-term 
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: The majority of adolescents own smartphones, although only 8% of 
them use health apps. Attrition rates from adolescent mobile health (mHealth) 
interventions for treating mental health problems such as anxiety and depression 
are an issue with a high degree of variation. Attrition in mHealth interventions 
targeting adolescent populations is frequently presented in a two-point fashion, 
from initiation of the intervention to the end of treatment, lacking more 
time-specific information on usage and times of attrition. Self-efficacy could 
provide an avenue to lower attrition rates, although a better understanding of 
the relationship between mental health factors and time-specific attrition rates 
is needed.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to obtain time-specific attrition rates 
among adolescents in an mHealth intervention, and to describe the intervention's 
usage and feasibility in relation to adolescent self-efficacy levels, and 
emotional and physical health.
METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled public school pilot trial was 
undertaken with 41 adolescents. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 
after 6 weeks, while in-app activity and attrition rates were continually 
assessed throughout the intervention period. The primary outcome was attrition 
based on time and type of in-app health behavior usage, and feasibility of the 
mHealth app. Secondary outcome measures were self-efficacy levels, depressive 
and anxiety symptoms, as well as standardized BMI and sleep. Analyses of group 
mean variances with adjusted α levels through Bonferroni corrections were used 
to assess main outcome effects.
RESULTS: The attrition from initiation of the intervention to 6-week follow up 
was 35%. Attrition started in the third week of the intervention and was related 
to daily time of app usage (Rt=0.43, P<.001). The number of average weekly 
in-app health exercises completed decreased significantly from the first week of 
the intervention (mean 55.25, SD 10.96) to the next week (mean 13.63, SD 2.94). 
However, usage increased by 22% between week 2 and the last week of the 
intervention (mean 16.69, SD 8.37). Usability measures revealed satisfactory 
scores (mean 78.09, SD 9.82) without gender differences (P=.85). Self-reported 
daily physical activity increased by 19.61% in the intervention group but 
dropped by 26.21% among controls. Self-efficacy levels increased by 8.23% in the 
invention arm compared to a 3.03% decrease in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usability of an 
mHealth intervention among adolescent participants. Indications were toward 
beneficial effects on physical and mental health that warrant further research. 
Focus on time-specific attrition measures alongside daily times of usage and 
ways to increase participants' self-efficacy levels appear to be a promising 
avenue for research on mHealth interventions for adolescent populations with the 
aim to ultimately lower attrition rates.

Real-time predictors of suicidal ideation: mobile assessment of hospitalized 
depressed patients.

Suicidal ideation is a risk factor for suicide attempt and completion. 
Cross-sectional or retrospective studies cannot capture the dynamic course and 
possible predictors of suicidal ideation as it occurs in daily life. This study 
utilizes an experience sampling paradigm to identify real-time predictors of 
suicidal ideation in inpatients with major depressive disorder. Thirty-one 
depressed patients admitted to a psychiatric unit were signaled by a mobile 
device to record suicidal ideation, affect, and other symptoms, multiple times a 
day over 1 week. Participants completed a total of 1350 questionnaires. 
Seventy-four percent of the sample reported suicidal ideation during the week. 
Time-lagged analyses revealed that momentary ratings of Sadness, Tension, and 
Boredom (as well as suicidal ideation itself) predicted subsequent suicidal 
thoughts in the following hours. Baseline severity of depression and past 
suicide attempts were both correlated with mean ideation severity during the 
week. A number of predictors identified in prior research (e.g. hopelessness) 
were unrelated to subsequent suicidal ideation in the current study. Momentary 
interventions that guide individuals through activities designed to reduce 
levels of Sadness, Tension, and Boredom in real-time (e.g., thought challenging, 
relaxation, behavioral activation) may be especially warranted.

BACKGROUND: Improvement in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score 
is a regulatory-approved measure for symptom improvement in postpartum 
depression (PPD). While digital solutions have the potential to overcome common 
treatment barriers, few have shown clinically significant improvement in PPD 
symptoms, as measured by the EPDS.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the MamaLift 
Plus digital therapeutic for the improvement of PPD symptoms in women who had 
recently given birth and had PPD, as assessed by the EPDS.
METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal trial 
recruited participants remotely. Eligibility criteria required that participants 
have an EPDS score between 13 and 19 and a confirmed diagnosis of PPD. 
Participants were randomized to the MamaLift Plus intervention or sham control 
arm, with stratification based on new mom status. "New moms" are those who have 
had one live birth. MamaLift Plus is a self-guided 8-week digital therapeutic 
for symptomatic treatment for PPD. MamaLift Plus can be used on a mobile device. 
MamaLift Plus delivers digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral 
Activation Therapy, Interpersonal Therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy for 
PPD. The sham control mimicked the features, functionality, and user experience 
of the treatment. The most important difference between the 2 arms was that 
participants in the sham control app did not receive any Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy. Primary and secondary endpoints were self-assessed. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of participants whose EPDS scores improved by ≥4 
points at the end of the study assessment. The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis 
set included all randomized participants who started at least 1 module. The full 
analysis set (FAS) population included all participants who completed at least 
one postbaseline assessment. The trial is closed.
RESULTS: Participants were recruited remotely between April 18 and May 24, 2023. 
Eligible participants were assessed by a licensed mental health provider to 
confirm a diagnosis of PPD. In addition, 95 participants were randomized to the 
intervention and 46 to the control groups. A total of 86.3% (82/95) of MamaLift 
Plus arm participants achieved an improvement of ≥4 points, compared with 23.9% 
(11/46) of sham control arm participants (P<.0001). There were 2 adverse events 
each in the intervention arm 2.1% (2/95) and sham control arm 4.3% (2/46). Only 
11 participants failed to provide any postbaseline assessment for the primary 
endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants who received MamaLift Plus exhibited significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms compared with control. 
Results suggest MamaLift Plus has the potential to improve treatment outcomes 
for women experiencing PPD.

BACKGROUND: CUIDA-TE is an APP that offers transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral 
therapy focused on enhancing emotion regulation. As a novelty, it incorporates 
ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which can provide psychological 
support in real time, when suffering arises. The main goal of the study is to 
evaluate the efficacy of CUIDA-TE to improve emotion regulation in healthcare 
workers, a population that has been particularly emotionally impacted by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) the study sample 
will be composed of a minimum of 174 healthcare workers. They will be randomly 
assigned to a 2-month EMI group (CUIDA-TE APP, n ≥ 58), a 2-month ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA) only group (MONITOR EMOCIONAL APP, n ≥ 58), or a 
wait-list control group (no daily monitoring nor intervention, n ≥ 58). CUIDA-TE 
will provide EMI if EMA reveals emotional problems, poor sleep quality/quantity, 
burnout, stress, or low perceived self-efficacy when regulating emotions. 
Depression will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include emotion 
regulation, quality of life, and resilience. Treatment acceptance and usability 
will also be measured. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- 
and post-intervention measurements, and at the 3-month follow-up for all groups.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that evaluates the efficacy 
of an APP-based EMI to improve emotion regulation skills in healthcare workers. 
This type of intervention might ultimately help disseminate treatments and reach 
a larger number of individuals than traditional face-to-face individual 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: While mental health applications are increasingly becoming available 
for large populations of users, there is a lack of controlled trials on the 
impacts of such applications. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered agents have 
been evaluated when assisting adults with cognitive impairments; however, few 
applications are available for aging adults who are still actively working. 
These adults often have high stress levels related to changes in their work 
places, and related symptoms eventually affect their quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of TEO (Therapy Empowerment 
Opportunity), a mobile personal health care agent with conversational AI. TEO 
promotes mental health and well-being by engaging patients in conversations to 
recollect the details of events that increased their anxiety and by providing 
therapeutic exercises and suggestions.
METHODS: The study was based on a protocolized intervention for stress and 
anxiety management. Participants with stress symptoms and mild-to-moderate 
anxiety received an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention 
delivered remotely. A group of participants also interacted with the agent TEO. 
The participants were active workers aged over 55 years. The experimental groups 
were as follows: group 1, traditional therapy; group 2, traditional therapy and 
mobile health (mHealth) agent; group 3, mHealth agent; and group 4, no treatment 
(assigned to a waiting list). Symptoms related to stress (anxiety, physical 
disease, and depression) were assessed prior to treatment (T1), at the end (T2), 
and 3 months after treatment (T3), using standardized psychological 
questionnaires. Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and General Anxiety 
Disorders-7 scales were administered before the intervention (T1), at mid-term 
(T2), at the end of the intervention (T3), and after 3 months (T4). At the end 
of the intervention, participants in groups 1, 2, and 3 filled in a satisfaction 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Despite randomization, statistically significant differences between 
groups were present at T1. Group 4 showed lower levels of anxiety and depression 
compared with group 1, and lower levels of stress compared with group 2. 
Comparisons between groups at T2 and T3 did not show significant differences in 
outcomes. Analyses conducted within groups showed significant differences 
between times in group 2, with greater improvements in the levels of stress and 
scores related to overall well-being. A general worsening trend between T2 and 
T3 was detected in all groups, with a significant increase in stress levels in 
group 2. Group 2 reported higher levels of perceived usefulness and 
satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences could be observed between 
participants who used the mHealth app alone or within the traditional CBT 
setting. However, the results indicated significant differences within the 
groups that received treatment and a stable tendency toward improvement, which 
was limited to individual perceptions of stress-related symptoms.

IMPORTANCE: More than two-thirds of US adults who screen positive for depression 
in the primary care setting do not receive treatment. These adults need 
evidence-based and scalable interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of Moodivate, a self-directed digital 
intervention for mental health, in treating depression symptoms among patients 
in the primary care setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-group decentralized randomized 
clinical trial recruited participants from September 22, 2021, to December 27, 
2023, and completed data collection on March 29, 2024. Adult patients with at 
least moderate symptoms of depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(score ≥10) were enrolled from 22 primary care clinics in South Carolina.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants received Moodivate (a digital behavioral activation 
intervention), Moodivate with health care provider access to information on 
patient use of the digital behavioral activation intervention in the electronic 
health record (EHR), or usual care for depression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change in depression 
symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) over 12 weeks. Secondary 
outcomes included a clinically significant improvement in depression symptoms on 
the BDI-II (10-point decrease in score), depression remission on the BDI-II 
(score ≤13), digital behavioral activation intervention engagement, and primary 
care provider (a physician or other health care professional who is responsible 
for a patient's primary care) use of the EHR features.
RESULTS: Among 649 participants, 495 (76%) were female and the mean (SD) age was 
44.68 (15.22) years. Participants who received the digital behavioral activation 
intervention, with and without EHR integration, had significantly improved 
depression symptoms vs those who received usual care over 12 weeks (least 
squares mean change from baseline for Moodivate: -10.34; SE = 0.82; d = 0.98; 
Moodivate with EHR: -9.88; SE = 0.81; d = 0.93; usual care: -5.94; SE = -0.80; 
d = 0.54). Participants in the Moodivate groups had 2.5 to 3.0 times higher odds 
of having a clinically significant improvement in depression symptoms 
(Moodivate: OR, 2.98 [97.5% CI, 1.69-5.27]; P < .001; Moodivate with EHR: OR, 
2.53 [97.5% CI, 1.45-4.41]; P < .001) and 2.3 to 2.6 times higher odds of 
experiencing depression remission (Moodivate: OR, 2.27 [97.5% CI, 1.16-4.44; 
P = .006; Moodivate with EHR: OR, 2.63 [97.5% CI, 1.38-5.04]; P < .001) than 
participants who received usual care. Participant engagement with Moodivate was 
high in the first month (68% to 100% weekly retention), and 33% of patients 
continued to use the digital behavioral activation intervention after 12 weeks. 
Fourteen percent of primary care providers who received access used the EHR 
functionality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that a digital 
behavioral activation intervention is effective for treating adults with at 
least moderate symptoms of depression in the primary care setting.

BACKGROUND: Research that investigates standalone effects of a mobile 
phone-based cognitive behavioral therapy without any human contact for reducing 
both psychological distress and risky drinking has been advancing; however, the 
number of studies is still limited. A mobile phone app called Self Record that 
facilitates cognitive restructuring through self-monitoring of daily thoughts 
and activities was developed in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: This study conducted a nonrandomized controlled pilot trial of the 
Self Record app to investigate standalone effects of the intervention on 
psychological distress and alcohol consumption among Japanese workers. 
Additionally, we examined moderating effects of negative mood regulation 
expectancies, which are beliefs about one's ability to control one's negative 
mood.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental design with a 1-month follow-up was conducted 
online in Japan from February 2016 to March 2016. A research marketing company 
recruited participants. The selection criteria were being a Japanese full-time 
worker (age 20-59 years), experiencing mild to moderate psychological distress, 
and having some interest in self-record apps. Assignment to group was based on 
participants' willingness to use the app in the study. All participants 
completed outcome measures of negative mood regulation expectancies, positive 
well-being, general distress, depression, anxiety, and typical/most weekly 
alcohol consumption.
RESULTS: From the recruitment, 15.65% (1083/6921) of participants met the 
inclusion criteria. Of these, 51.43% (557/1083) enrolled in the study: 54.9% 
(306/557) in the intervention group and 45.1% (251/557) in the control group. At 
the 1-month follow-up, 15.3% (85/557) of participants had dropped out. 
Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that participants in the intervention group 
reported increased typical drinking (η2=.009) and heavy drinking (η2=.001). 
Adherence to using the app was low; 64.8% (199/306) of participants in the 
intervention group discontinued using the app on the first day. Additionally, 
65.7% (366/557) of the total sample did not correctly answer the validity checks 
in the outcome measures (eg, "Please select 'mildly agree' for this item"). 
Therefore, per-protocol analyses were conducted after removing these 
participants. Results showed that continuing app users (42/127) in the 
intervention group reported increases in anxiety (η2=.006), typical drinking 
(η2=.005), and heavy drinking (η2=.007) compared to those in the control group 
(85/127). Negative mood regulation expectancies moderated the effects of the 
intervention for general distress (beta=.39).
CONCLUSIONS: Results were contrary to our hypotheses. Self-recording methods of 
standalone mobile phone interventions may heighten individuals' awareness of 
their pathological thought and drinking behavior, but may be insufficient to 
decrease them unless combined with a more intense or face-to-face intervention. 
Limitations include high attrition in this study; measures to improve the 
response rate are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a new treatment class for major 
depressive disorder (MDD). This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of 
a novel DTx, CT-152 (Rejoyn™), for MDD adjunctive to antidepressant medication 
monotherapy.
METHODS: Adults aged 22-64 years with MDD having an inadequate response to 
current antidepressant medication monotherapy were enrolled in a phase 3 
multicenter, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, remote trial with a 6-week 
intervention and 4-week extension. Delivered via smartphone apps, the CT-152 
group received a cognitive-emotional and behavioral therapeutic intervention; 
the control group received a sham app with a working memory task. Both groups 
received supportive text messages and continued current antidepressant 
medication. The primary outcome was Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) score change from baseline to week 6. Treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, 386 participants were randomly assigned (CT-152, n = 194; 
sham, n = 192). In the primary efficacy analysis of participants with ≥1 
treatment session and ≥ 1 MADRS assessment post-baseline (n = 354), MADRS score 
changed -9.03 in the CT-152 group and - 7.25 in the sham (difference - 1.78, 
P = 0.0568). These results were consistent with data from additional patient and 
clinician scales. In a supportive analysis of the intent-to-treat sample 
(n = 386), the between-group difference in 6-week MADRS change from baseline was 
-2.12 (P = 0.0211), favoring CT-152. No TEAEs or discontinuations were 
considered related to CT-152, and no deaths occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-152 resulted in depression symptom improvement and a favorable 
safety profile. Based on these data, CT-152 became the first FDA-authorized 
prescription DTx for the adjunctive treatment of MDD.

Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT), which involves the use of a digital 
application to support face-to-face psychotherapy, is increasingly offered to 
patients with depression amid a growing body of research on its efficacy. 
However, there is still limited understanding of the factors that influence the 
efficacy of this novel treatment method. To investigate the effects of potential 
factors such as patient satisfaction with the received treatment, patients' 
self-rated working alliance with their therapist, and patients' rating of system 
usability of the digital application, this secondary analysis study focused on a 
sample of 66 university students who completed an effective 6-week bCBT program 
that included weekly sessions with a therapist and access to a digital mental 
health application. We examined whether those three potential factors predict 
patients' improvement in depressive symptoms in a bCBT treatment. Patient 
satisfaction and working alliance are known predictors of treatment success in 
standard psychotherapy, yet their importance in blended treatment is largely 
unstudied. System usability is a factor that is frequently addressed while 
describing digital treatment programs, yet its contribution to the success of 
treatments has been mostly omitted. All the variables analyzed displayed a 
significant positive correlation with improvement in depressive symptoms. When 
taken together, all the factors account for 16.6 % of the variance in the 
outcome. However, when three variables were added in the backward multiple 
linear regression with stepwise elimination, only patient satisfaction emerged 
as a predictor of the outcome. Although there are significant correlations 
between working alliance and system usability and the improvement of depression 
in the bCBT program, their lack of predictive power in comparison to patient 
satisfaction renders the results inconclusive. Future studies could explore the 
potential contribution of additional variables to the improvement of depressive 
symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are common during the peripartum period and may 
have far-reaching consequences for both mother and child. Unfortunately, most 
antenatal care systems do not provide any structured screening for maternal 
mental health. As a consequence, mental illnesses are often overlooked and not 
treated adequately. If correctly diagnosed, cognitive behavioral therapy is 
currently the treatment of choice for mental illnesses. In addition, 
mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) seem to represent a promising treatment 
option for anxiety and depression during the peripartum period. Considering the 
internet's increasing omnipresence, MBIs can also be offered electronically via 
a (tablet) computer or smartphone (electronically based MBI = eMBI).
OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to examine the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of an eMBI (the mindmom application) developed by an 
interdisciplinary team of gynecologists, psychologists, and midwives, teaching 
pregnant women how to deal with stress, pregnancy-related anxiety, and 
depressive symptoms. The study sample consists of pregnant women in their third 
trimester who screened positive for emotional distress. The mindmom study is a 
bicentric prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is currently 
conducted at the University women's hospitals of Heidelberg and Tübingen, 
Germany.
METHODS: Within the scope of the routine prenatal care, pregnant women attending 
routine pregnancy care in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, are invited to 
participate in a screening for mental distress based on the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale (EPDS). Women with an EPDS screening result > 9 will be 
referred to one of the mindmom coordinating study centers and are offered 
counseling either face-to-face or via videotelephony. After an initial 
psychological counseling, women are invited to participate in an eMBI in their 
last pregnancy trimester. The study will enroll N = 280 study participants 
(N = 140 per group), who are randomized 1:1 into the intervention (IG) or 
control group (treatment as usual = TAU). All participants are requested to 
complete a total of 7 digital assessments (5 visits pre- and 2 follow-up visits 
postpartum), involving self-report questionnaires, sociodemographic and medical 
data, physiological measures, and morning cortisol profiles. The primary outcome 
will be depressive and anxiety symptoms, measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale, the State Trait Anxiety Questionnaire, and the 
Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include mindfulness, 
satisfaction with birth, quality of life, fetal attachment, bonding, mode of 
delivery, and cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: This is the first German RCT to examine the (cost-)effectiveness of 
an eMBI on maternal mental health during pregnancy. If successful, the mindmom 
app represents a low-threshold and cost-effective help for psychologically 
distressed women during pregnancy, thereby reducing the negative impact on 
perinatal health outcome.

BACKGROUND: Major depression is one of the most debilitating diseases in terms 
of quality of life. Less than half of patients suffering from depression can 
achieve remission after adequate antidepressant treatment. Another promising 
treatment option is cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). However, the need for 
experienced therapists and substantive dedicated time prevent CBT from being 
widely disseminated. In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness 
of switching antidepressants and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the 
same time, in comparison to switching antidepressants only, among patients still 
suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment.
METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted 
since September 2014. The smartphone-based CBT program, named the "Kokoro-App," 
for major depression has been developed and its feasibility has been confirmed 
in a previous open study. The program consists of an introduction, 6 sessions 
and an epilogue, and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks by patients. In 
the present trial, 164 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder and still 
suffering from depressive symptoms after adequate antidepressant treatment for 
more than 4 weeks will be allocated to the Kokoro-App plus switching 
antidepressant group or the switching antidepressant alone group. The 
participants allocated to the latter group will receive full components of the 
Kokoro-App after 9 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the total score 
on the Patient Health Questionnaire through the 9 weeks of the program, as 
assessed at week 0, 1, 5 and 9 via telephone by blinded raters. The secondary 
outcomes include the change in the total score of the Beck Depression 
Inventory-II, change in side effects as assessed by the Frequency, Intensity and 
Burden of Side Effects Rating, and treatment satisfaction.
DISCUSSION: An effective and reachable intervention may not only lead to 
healthier mental status among depressed patients, but also to reduced social 
burden from this illness. This paper outlines the background and methods of a 
trial that evaluates the possible additive value of a smartphone-based CBT 
program for treatment-resistant depression.

The rate of exposure to traumatic events is high globally, and post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most serious consequences. It was reported 
that approximately 14 million people were affected by earthquakes in Turkey in 
February 2023. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a therapeutic approach to 
treating PTSD and has a proven efficacy. However, access to face-to-face 
therapies such as CBT is limited and there is a high dropout rate. 
Technology-based interventions can offer new solutions to make CBT more 
accessible and integrated into daily life. In this study, we will develop an 
application called TraumaRelief, which aims to relieve PTSD symptoms. We will 
test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of this application through a 
pilot randomized controlled study conducted in Turkey, with 105 participants 
aged between 18 and 65 years who have experienced a traumatic event. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to the Application Plus Online Therapist 
Support Group (AT + OT Group), Application Only Group (Group A), and Waitlist 
Control Group (WLC Group). This study aims to evaluate symptoms of PTSD, 
depression, and anxiety, as well as their effects on quality of life. In 
addition, the feasibility and acceptability of the study; the attrition, 
consent, recruitment, and adherence rate to the application; fidelity of 
intervention delivery; system usability score; preferred and least preferred 
module components; app utilization frequency; and likelihood to recommend the 
application will be examined. Application efficacy will be monitored with 
follow-ups at one and three months. The results could provide important 
information on the integration of technology-based treatments with 
psychotherapy. In addition, it could allow the evaluation of potential mobile 
applications in the field of psychotherapy and represents an important step in 
the development and evaluation of a customized mobile application for a society 
with unique cultural and social dynamics, such as Turkey. It could also be an 
important resource for increasing the capacity to cope with the effects of 
traumatic events that have occurred in Turkey or future events.

Task-sharing holds promise for bridging gaps in access to mental healthcare; yet 
there remain significant challenges to scaling up task-sharing models. This 
formative study aimed to develop a digital platform for training non-specialist 
providers without prior experience in mental healthcare to deliver a brief 
psychosocial intervention for depression in community settings in Texas. A 
5-step development approach was employed, consisting of: blueprinting, 
scripting, video production and digital content creation, uploading digital 
content to a Learning Management System and user testing. This resulted in the 
development of two courses, one called Foundational Skills covering the skills 
to become an effective counselor, and the second called Behavioral Activation 
covering the skills for addressing adult depression. Twenty-one participants 
with a range of health-related backgrounds, including 11 with prior training in 
mental healthcare, completed the training and joined focus group discussions 
offering qualitative feedback and recommendations for improving the program's 
usability. Participant feedback centered around the need to make the content 
more interactive, to include additional engaging features, and to improve the 
layout and usability of the platform. The next steps will involve evaluating the 
training program on developing the skills of non-specialist providers and 
supporting its uptake and implementation.

BACKGROUND: Even before COVID-19, there has been an urgent need to expand access 
to and quality of mental health care. This paper introduces an 8-week treatment 
protocol to realize that vision-Technology Enabled Clinical Care (TECC). TECC 
offers innovation in clinical assessment, monitoring, and interventions for 
mental health. TECC uses the mindLAMP app to enable digital phenotyping, 
clinical communication, and smartphone-based exercises that will augment 
in-person or telehealth virtual visits. TECC exposes participants to an array of 
evidence-based treatments (cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior 
therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy) introduced through clinical sessions 
and then practiced through interactive activities provided through a smartphone 
app called mindLAMP.
OBJECTIVE: TECC will test the feasibility of providing technology-enabled mental 
health care within an outpatient clinic; explore the practicality for providing 
this care to individuals with limited English proficiency; and track anxiety, 
depression, and mood symptoms for participants to measure the effectiveness of 
the TECC design.
METHODS: The TECC study will assess the acceptability and efficacy of this care 
model in 50 participants as compared to an age- and gender-matched cohort of 
patients presenting with similar clinical severity of depression, anxiety, or 
psychotic symptoms. Participants will be recruited from clinics in the Metro 
Boston area. Aspects of TECC will be conducted in both Spanish and English to 
ensure wide access to care for multiple populations.
RESULTS: The results of the TECC study will be used to support or adapt this 
model of care and create training resources to ensure its dissemination. The 
study results will be posted on ClinicalTrials.gov, with primary outcomes 
related to changes in mood, anxiety, and stress, and secondary outcomes related 
to engagement, alliance, and satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: TECC combines new digital mental health technology with updated 
clinical protocols and workflows designed to ensure patients can benefit from 
innovation in digital mental health. Supporting multiple languages, TECC is 
designed to ensure digital health equity and highlights how mobile health can 
bridge, not expand, gaps in care for underserved populations.

BACKGROUND: Many adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
experience difficulties related to emotion regulation. Such difficulties are 
known to substantially impact quality of life and overall functioning. Yet, 
there is a lack of treatment interventions specifically designed to address 
these challenges.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development and assess the 
feasibility, along with the initial clinical outcomes, of a novel blended 
intervention for adults with ADHD. The blended intervention combines both 
face-to-face and digital components and is specifically designed to address 
emotion dysregulation in ADHD.
METHODS: This intervention was an 8-week blended intervention combining weekly 
face-to-face group sessions with a supplementary digital companion app. The 
intervention is based on elements from dialectic behavioral therapy skills 
training and positive psychology. To evaluate its feasibility, we performed a 
10-week feasibility study with an uncontrolled pre-post study design, including 
16 adults with ADHD and co-occurring emotion dysregulation. The feasibility 
measures encompassed adherence, satisfaction, and perceived credibility of the 
intervention. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by self-reported symptoms of 
emotion dysregulation, inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, executive 
function, depression, anxiety, and a measure of quality of life. Paired sample 
2-tailed t tests were used to analyze clinical outcomes with a 
Bonferroni-corrected significance level.
RESULTS: Both treatment credibility and treatment satisfaction were rated 
favorably by the majority of the participants. In particular, the participants 
emphasized meeting others with ADHD as beneficial. In terms of adherence, 3 
participants withdrew before initiating the intervention, while another 4 
participants did not complete the intervention. On average, the participants who 
enrolled in the intervention attended 6.2 of the 8 group sessions and completed 
6.7 of the 8 skills training modules in the companion app. In terms of clinical 
outcomes, there was a reduction in symptoms of emotion dysregulation from before 
to after the intervention (d=2.0). Significant improvements were also observed 
in measures of inattention (d=1.1) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (d=0.9). 
However, no significant improvements were found in the domains of depression, 
anxiety, quality of life, and executive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: The results are encouraging, both in terms of feasibility and the 
preliminary clinical results on emotion dysregulation. The blended format, 
combining digital and face-to-face elements, may also seem to offer some 
advantages: the group-based format was valued as it facilitated peer 
interaction, while a rather high completion of modules in the companion app 
highlights its potential to enhance skills training between the group sessions. 
Future randomized controlled trials are called for to further evaluate the 
clinical effectiveness of the intervention.

OBJECTIVE: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) combines face-to-face 
therapy with digital elements, such as digital health apps. This pilot study 
aimed to explore the effectiveness and safety of a novel bCBT application for 
treating unipolar depression in adults combined with cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) compared to CBT alone in routine care.
METHODS: Patients (N = 82) were randomly assigned to bCBT (n = 42) or CBT 
(n = 40) over 12 weeks. bCBT consisted of weekly CBT sessions accompanied by the 
elona therapy depression module (a bCBT application for unipolar depression) for 
use between sessions. Standard CBT consisted of weekly CBT sessions. Outcomes 
(6,12 weeks) were analyzed with linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Improvements in depressive symptoms (BDI-II, PHQ-9) were descriptively 
larger for the bCBT group. Yet, this difference did not reach statistical 
significance. bCBT was superior to standard CBT in secondary outcome measures of 
psychological health (d = .50) and generalized anxiety symptoms (d = -.45). In 
other secondary outcomes (BAI, PSWQ, GSE, WHOQOL-BREF), improvements were 
descriptively larger for bCBT compared to CBT.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study provided preliminary evidence that bCBT might be 
advantageous in comparison to CBT alone in the treatment of depression, but 
larger RCTs of the bCBT application are needed.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a hidden burden, yet it is a leading cause of 
disability worldwide. Despite the adverse effects of depression, fewer than 
one-third of patients receive care. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
(i-CBT) is an effective treatment for depression, and combining i-CBT with 
supervised care could make the therapy scalable and effective. A stepped care 
model is a framework for beginning treatment with an effective and low-intensity 
intervention while adapting care based on the patient's needs.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of a stepped care i-CBT model 
for depression based on changes in self-reported depressive symptoms.
METHODS: In this single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, participants were 
allocated to either the i-CBT-only group (28/56, 50%) or the i-CBT with stepped 
care group (28/56, 50%). Both groups received a 13-week i-CBT program tailored 
for depression. The i-CBT program was provided through a secure, online mental 
health clinic called the Online Psychotherapy Tool. Participants read through 
the sessions and completed the assignments related to each session. Participants 
in the stepped care group received additional interventions from their care 
provider based on standard questionnaire scores (ie, Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology [QIDS], 
and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form) and 
their assignment responses. From lowest to highest intensity, the additional 
interventions included SMS text messages, phone calls, video calls, or a video 
call with a psychiatrist.
RESULTS: For this study, 56 participants were recruited to complete an i-CBT 
program (n=28, 50%; mean age 37.9; SD 13.08 y; 7/28, 27% were men) or an i-CBT 
with stepped care program (n=28, 50%; mean age 40.6; SD 14.28 y; 11/28, 42% were 
men). The results of this study indicate that the i-CBT program was effective in 
significantly reducing depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9 
(F4,80=9.95; P<.001) and QIDS (F2,28=5.73; P=.008); however, there were no 
significant differences in the reduction of depressive symptoms between the 2 
groups (PHQ-9: F4,80=0.43; P=.78; QIDS: F2,28=3.05; P=.06). The stepped care 
group was not significantly better in reducing depressive symptoms than the 
i-CBT group (PHQ-9, P=.79; QIDS, P=.06). Although there were no significant 
differences observed between the number of participants who completed the 
program between the groups (χ21=2.6; P=.10), participants in the stepped care 
group, on average, participated in more sessions than those who prematurely 
terminated participation in the i-CBT group (t55=-2; P=.03; 95% CI -4.83 to 
-0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a stepped care approach in i-CBT is an effective 
treatment for depression, and the stepped care model can assist patients to 
complete more sessions in their treatment.

Pain is the hallmark symptom of sickle cell disease (SCD). By adolescence, 20% 
of youth with SCD develop chronic SCD pain. Our randomized controlled trial 
found significant reductions in pain in youth receiving digital 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs education control. However, little is 
known about factors that moderate the effects of CBT in adolescents with SCD. 
This secondary data analysis aims to identify adolescent and family 
characteristics that moderate treatment effects on pain outcomes in 111 
adolescents aged 12 to 18 with SCD (M = 14.9, SD = 1.9, girls = 59%) and their 
caregivers. Adolescents were randomly assigned to digital CBT (N = 57) or 
education control (N = 54). Digital CBT included separate content for 
parents/caregivers (ie, a website to learn problem-solving skills and behavioral 
and communication strategies) and youths (ie, a smartphone app and website to 
learn pain management skills). Outcomes were assessed at pretreatment, 
posttreatment (2 months), and follow-up (6 months). Potential moderators 
included pretreatment variables (ie, adolescent variables: age, executive 
functioning, anxiety, depression; parent variables: psychological distress, 
protective behaviors, family functioning). There was a significant overall 
effect modification on pain intensity outcomes from pretreatment parent 
psychological distress (P = 0.012), where CBT appeared more effective among 
those with elevated parental distress. Differential intervention effects were 
observed across multiple potential moderator groups, though most of these 
differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study underscores the 
importance of family factors in understanding the efficacy of digital CBT for 
adolescent SCD pain, pointing to the need for future research to optimize CBT 
through targeted family-focused strategies.

BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are one of the most common psychiatric 
disorders that occur in people of all ages.
AIM: To assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and 
interpersonal therapy (IPT) in cases of depression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample for the study comprised 52 diagnosed cases of 
major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the 10th revision of the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria in the age range of 21 to 50 years. 
They were randomized with the help of the app and assigned to CBT and IPT 
groups. Two patients had dropped out of the CBT group. Hence, finally, 50 cases 
were taken for study. A total of 12 therapy sessions were given. All patients 
were given standard treatment as prescribed.
RESULTS: Findings of paired samples t-test to assess the within-group 
differences in both the groups (CBT and IPT) as well as gains score statistics 
or difference score statistics (pre-test minus post-test) were applied to 
compare group differences. Results of paired samples 't' test suggest that there 
was a statistically significant difference in the scores of both the groups from 
pre-test to post-test. IPT group had shown significantly better outcomes as 
quantified by the percentage of patients scoring less on the outcome variable of 
the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS), Hopelessness Scale, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).
CONCLUSION: Both CBT and IPT are efficacious in the treatment of MDD. IPT 
yielded better results on MADRS as compared to CBT on parameters of outcome in 
the present study. The findings indicate that interventions were effective in 
reducing the symptoms of depression.

BACKGROUND: Depression frequently first emerges during adolescence, and one in 
five young people will experience an episode of depression by the age of 
18 years. Despite advances in treatment, there has been limited progress in 
addressing the burden at a population level. Accordingly, there has been growing 
interest in prevention approaches as an additional pathway to address 
depression. Depression can be prevented using evidence-based psychological 
programmes. However, barriers to implementing and accessing these programmes 
remain, typically reflecting a requirement for delivery by clinical experts and 
high associated delivery costs. Digital technologies, specifically smartphones, 
are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to 
mental health programmes. The Future Proofing Study is a large-scale 
school-based trial investigating whether cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) 
delivered by smartphone application can prevent depression.
METHODS: A randomised controlled trial targeting up to 10,000 Year 8 Australian 
secondary school students will be conducted. In Stage I, schools will be 
randomised at the cluster level either to receive the CBT intervention app 
(SPARX) or to a non-active control group comparator. The primary outcome will be 
symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes include psychological distress, 
anxiety and insomnia. At the 12-month follow-up, participants in the 
intervention arm with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in an 
individual-level randomised controlled trial (Stage II) and be randomised to 
receive a second CBT app which targets sleep difficulties (Sleep Ninja) or a 
control condition. Assessments will occur post intervention (both trial stages) 
and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post baseline. Primary analyses will use 
an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes in symptoms from baseline to 
follow-up relative to the control group using mixed-effect models.
DISCUSSION: This is the first trial testing the effectiveness of smartphone apps 
delivered to school students to prevent depression at scale. Results from this 
trial will provide much-needed insight into the feasibility of this approach. 
They stand to inform policy and commission decisions concerning if and how such 
programmes should be deployed in school-based settings in Australia and beyond.

BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is a critical factor influencing both physical and 
mental health. It can weaken the immune system, affect cardiovascular health, 
and lower quality of life, often leading to psychological disorders like anxiety 
and depression.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth stress 
management interventions on psychological health parameters, specifically 
anxiety, depression, stress, and quality of life in patients with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD).
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across several databases, 
including the Cochrane Library, APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, 
and clinical trial registers. Randomized controlled trials assessing the impact 
of eHealth stress management interventions, namely internet-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), telephone-delivered CBT, internet-based stress 
management training, or telephone-delivered stress management training, on the 
specified psychological outcomes in patients with CVD were included. The control 
group comprised no intervention, a waitlist, (enhanced) usual care, or a 
web-based intervention not focusing on stress management. To evaluate potential 
bias, the Risk-of-Bias 2 tool was applied. A random-effects meta-analysis was 
performed using standard mean difference (SMD) as the effect size, with a 
sensitivity analysis using mean difference (MD).
RESULTS: A total of 6 randomized controlled studies were considered in the 
meta-analysis. In 5 studies internet-based CBT interventions were examined, 
while one study used an eHealth intervention based on a CBT approach. The 
control groups received either usual care, were placed on a waitlist, or 
participated in a web-based discussion forum. After the intervention period, 
which ranged from 8 weeks to 6 months, a significant reduction in depressive 
symptoms (SMD=-0.46, MD=-2.33; P<.001), as assessed by the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9, was observed in the intervention group compared with the 
control group. Mental health-related quality of life, assessed by the subscale 
of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, showed significant improvement 
(SMD=0.38, MD=3.89; P<.001) in the intervention group in comparison to the 
control group following the intervention period.
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrates that eHealth stress management 
interventions substantially improve psychological health parameters in patients 
with CVD. Given the significant positive impact, health care providers should 
consider integrating eHealth stress management programs into standard care for 
patients with CVD. These programs can be a valuable tool in mitigating the 
psychological burdens associated with chronic cardiovascular conditions, 
ultimately improving overall patient outcomes and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: The community-based, 4-level intervention of the European Alliance 
Against Depression (EAAD) is simultaneously addressing depression and suicidal 
behavior. Intervention activities target primary care health professionals 
(level 1), the general public (level 2), community facilitators (level 3), and 
patients and their relatives (level 4). Activities comprise the digital 
iFightDepression tool, a guided self-management tool based on cognitive 
behavioral therapy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present the European Union-cofunded EAAD-Best 
study protocol, aiming at the implementation, dissemination, and evaluation of 
the 4-level intervention and the iFightDepression tool in several countries 
across Europe.
METHODS: The 4-level intervention has been implemented for the first time in 
Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, and Poland. In 3 countries that have already 
implemented the 4-level intervention (Hungary, Ireland, and Spain), activities 
have been extended to new regions. In addition, the nationwide uptake of the 
iFightDepression tool by patients with depression has been promoted in all 
mentioned countries and Italy.
RESULTS: To evaluate the implementation of the 4-level intervention and the 
iFightDepression tool, data related to the process, output, and outcome were 
collected between 2022 and 2024. Data processing and analyses started in 2023. 
Analyses are expected to be completed in 2024. Results are expected to be 
published in 2025.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper informs researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders on 
how to implement best practices in mental health promotion and evaluate their 
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: IntelliCare is a mental health app platform with 14 apps that are 
elemental, simple and brief to use, and eclectic. Although a variety of apps may 
improve engagement, leading to better outcomes, they may require navigation aids 
such as recommender systems that can quickly direct a person to a useful app.
OBJECTIVE: As the first step toward developing navigation and recommender tools, 
this study explored app-use patterns across the IntelliCare platform and their 
relationship with depression and anxiety outcomes.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the IntelliCare Field Trial, which 
recruited people with depression or anxiety. Participants of the trial received 
8 weeks of coaching, primarily by text, and weekly random recommendations for 
apps. App-use metrics included frequency and lifetime use. Depression and 
anxiety, measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively, were assessed at baseline and end of 
treatment. Cluster analysis was utilized to determine patterns of app use; 
ordinal logistic regression models and log-rank tests were used to determine if 
these use metrics alone, or in combination, predicted improvement or remission 
in depression or anxiety.
RESULTS: The analysis included 96 people who generally followed recommendations 
to download and try new apps each week. Apps were clustered into 5 groups: 
Thinking (apps that targeted or relied on thinking), Calming (relaxation and 
insomnia), Checklists (apps that used checklists), Activity (behavioral 
activation and activity), and Other. Both overall frequency of use and lifetime 
use predicted response for depression and anxiety. The Thinking, Calming, and 
Checklist clusters were associated with improvement in depression and anxiety, 
and the Activity cluster was associated with improvement in Anxiety only. 
However, the use of clusters was less strongly associated with improvement than 
individual app use.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the field trial remained engaged with a suite of 
apps for the full 8 weeks of the trial. App-use patterns did fall into clusters, 
suggesting that some knowledge about the use of one app may be useful in 
selecting another app that the person is more likely to use and may help suggest 
apps based on baseline symptomology and personal preference.

The World Health Organization is developing a range of interventions, including 
technology supported interventions, to help address the mental health treatment 
gap, particularly in low and middle-income countries. One of these, 
Step-by-Step, is a guided, technology supported, intervention for depression. It 
provides psychoeducation and training in behavioural activation through an 
illustrated narrative with additional therapeutic techniques such as stress 
management (slow breathing), identifying strengths, positive self-talk, 
increasing social support and relapse prevention. Step-by-Step has been designed 
so that it can be adapted for use in settings with different cultural contexts 
and resource availability and to be meaningful in communities affected by 
adversity. This paper describes the process of developing Step-by-Step and 
highlights particular design features aimed at increasing feasibility of 
implementation in a wide variety of settings.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the availability of pharmacological treatment for seizures, 
people with epilepsy (PwE) commonly experience impairments in quality of life 
(QoL). Given the limited access to psychosocial treatments for PwE, digital 
interventions could bridge treatment gaps and help improve QoL. The objective of 
this study was to examine the effectiveness of emyna, a fully automated digital 
intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, in 
improving health-related QoL among PwE who reported impairments in QoL. A 
previous trial showed that emyna was effective in improving depressive symptoms 
among PwE with a comorbid depressive disorder, but its effects on QoL among PwE 
without comorbid depression remain unknown.
METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted with N = 438 PwE 
(mean age = 37.5, 70.3% women, physician-verified diagnoses) who were assigned 
to the intervention group (n = 216), which used emyna alongside treatment as 
usual (TAU), or the control group (n = 222), which received TAU only. QoL and 
secondary outcomes such as general self-efficacy, medication adherence, general 
distress, and epilepsy-related work and social adjustment were assessed at 
baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was QoL assessed with the 
Quality of Life in Epilepsy [QOLIE-31] total score at 3 months 
post-randomization.
RESULTS: Findings from the intent-to-treat analyses showed that after 3 months, 
participants in the intervention group experienced significant and clinically 
relevant improvements in health-related QoL compared to the control group 
(baseline-adjusted group difference = 4.5; 95% CI = [2.0, 6.9], p < 0.001; 
Cohen's d = 0.32). Effects on secondary outcomes did not reach statistical 
significance.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study extends previous research by demonstrating that emyna 
facilitates improvements in QoL in a diverse group of PwE treated in routine 
care settings. This CBT-based digital intervention therefore presents a 
convenient and cost-effective addition to healthcare providers' treatment 
repertoire.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In our study, we tested a digital program called emyna, 
which conveys cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to help improve the 
quality of life for people living with epilepsy. We found that those who used 
emyna alongside their usual treatments felt better about their quality of life 
compared to those who did not use the program. Emyna offers a new, convenient 
way for people with epilepsy to manage their condition, which can be used 
alongside currently available treatments.

BACKGROUND: Until recently, treatments for chronic pain commonly relied on 
in-person interventions, and despite more hybrid care options today, capacity 
for delivery remains challenged. Digital programs focusing on the psychosocial 
aspects of pain may provide low-barrier alternatives.
AIMS: Through a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effectiveness 
of a multimodal mobile application.
METHODS: Participants (n = 198; 82% women, mean age = 46.7 [13.1] years; mean 
pain duration 13.6 [11.2] years) with nonmalignant chronic pain were randomized 
to either a 6-week intervention (n = 98) or a wait-listed usual care group (n 
= 100). The intervention involved regular engagement with a user-guided mobile 
application (Curable Inc.) informed by the biopsychosocial model of pain that 
included pain education, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and 
expressive writing. The co-primary outcomes were pain severity and interference 
at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: We observed significant improvements in the intervention group compared 
to the control group with estimated changes of -0.67 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] -1.04 to -0.29, P < .001, d = 0.43) and -0.60 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.03, P 
= .04, d = 0.27) for pain severity and interference, respectively. There were 
significant improvements across secondary outcomes (Patient-Reported Outcome 
Measurement Information System pain interference; pain catastrophizing; anxiety, 
depression; stress). Frequency of app use was correlated with improved pain 
interference (P < .001) and pain catastrophizing (P = 0.018), and changes from 
baseline persisted in the intervention group at 12 weeks (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: A short-term mobile app intervention resulted in significant 
improvements across physical and mental health outcomes compared to wait-listed 
usual care.

Publisher: Contexte : Jusqu'à récemment, les traitements pour la douleur 
chronique se faisaient principalement en personne. Bien que de plus en plus 
d'options de soins hybrides soient désormais disponibles, la capacité à fournir 
ces soins demeure un défi. Les programmes numériques qui se concentrent sur les 
aspects psychosociaux de la douleur peuvent offrir des solutions de rechange 
présentant peu de barrières.Objectifs : Dans le cadre d'un essai contrôlé 
randomisé, nous avons étudié l'efficacité d'une application mobile 
multimodale.Méthodes : Les participants (n = 198 ; 82 % de femmes, âge moyen = 
46,7 [13,1] ans; durée moyenne de la douleur 13,6 [11,2] ans) souffrant de 
douleur chronique non cancéreuse ont été répartis au hasard entre une 
intervention de six semaines (n = 98) et un groupe de soins habituels sur liste 
d'attente (n = 100). L'intervention consistait en l’utilisation régulière d’une 
application mobile guidée par l'utilisateur, basée sur le modèle biopsychosocial 
de la douleur comprenant l'éducation à la douleur, la méditation, la thérapie 
cognitivo-comportementale et l'écriture expressive. Les résultats coprimaires 
étaient l'intensité de la douleur et l'interférence à six semaines.Résultats : 
Nous avons observé des améliorations significatives dans le groupe 
d'intervention par rapport au groupe témoin, avec des changements estimés de 
-0,67 (intervalle de confiance à 95 % [IC] -1,04 à -0,29, P < 0,001, d = 0,43) 
et -0,60 (IC 95 % -1,18 à -0,03, P = 0,04, d = 0,27) pour l'intensité de la 
douleur et l'interférence, respectivement. Des améliorations significatives ont 
été observées pour les résultats secondaires (interférence de la douleur selon 
le système d’information sur les mesures de résultats rapportés par les 
patients; catastrophisation de la douleur; anxiété; dépression et stress). La 
fréquence d'utilisation de l'application était corrélée à une amélioration de 
l'interférence de la douleur (P < 0,001) et de la catastrophisation de la 
douleur (P = 0,018). De plus, les changements par rapport à l'état initial ont 
persisté dans le groupe d'intervention après 12 semaines (P < 0,05).Conclusions 
: Une intervention à court terme au moyen d'une application mobile a permis 
d'améliorer de manière significative les résultats en matière de santé physique 
et mentale comparativement aux soins habituels sur liste d'attente.

BACKGROUND: In Japan, the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms within 
the working population has risen. This has been accentuated by the economic 
repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social isolation resulting from 
remote work setups. Mobile health apps, particularly those incorporating 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) features, have shown potential in addressing 
these symptoms. These self-guided CBT interventions hold promise in alleviating 
the heightened depressive and anxiety symptoms often observed among Japanese 
employees.
OBJECTIVE: Using a randomized controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of the 
"INTELLECT" app against a no-treatment control group in improving depressive 
symptoms and CBT skills among Japanese full-time employees at postintervention 
and 2-month follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 123 full-time Japanese employees were randomly allocated to 
either the intervention group (INTELLECT), where they engaged with self-help CBT 
features, or to a control group receiving no treatment. Intervention 
participants were required to engage with these features for at least 20 minutes 
per week over a span of 4 weeks. Weekly self-reported assessments were collected 
from all participants starting from baseline and continuing until the end of the 
4-week intervention period. Subsequent assessments were conducted at 1-month and 
2-month follow-up intervals. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate any 
effects of the self-guided intervention on depressive symptoms, as measured by 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, and cognitive behavioral skills, as measured 
by the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Skills Scale. The app's feasibility, 
usability, and acceptability ratings were also examined using the Implementation 
Outcome Scales for Digital Mental Health (iOSDMH).
RESULTS: The final sample (n=73) consisted of 46 (63%) participants who were 
female, 23 (32%) participants who were male, and 4 (6%) participants who 
identified as other genders, with a mean age of 40.4 (SD 10.7) years. 
Significant time × group interactions were found at postintervention and 2-month 
follow-up, with the intervention group (n=34) reporting significantly lower 
depressive symptoms than the control group (n=38) at postintervention 
(t364.7426=-2.243; P=.03; Cohen d=-0.57, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.06) and 2-month 
follow-up (t364.6948=-3.284; P<.001; Cohen d=-0.85, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.32). In 
addition, intervention participants reported significantly greater improvements 
in self-monitoring cognitive skills than control participants at 
postintervention (t120.7526=2.672; P=.01; Cohen d=0.68, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.18) but 
not follow-up (t121.5475=1.947; P=.05; Cohen d=0.50, 95% CI -0.01 to 1.02).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that CBT features on the INTELLECT app 
are effective in improving depressive symptoms and self-monitoring cognitive 
skills.

BACKGROUND: Recently, internet-based interventions have been proposed as 
effective treatments for people with panic disorder (PD). However, little is 
known about the clinical effects of integrating mobile technology into these 
interventions. Because users carry their smartphones with them throughout the 
day, we hypothesize that this technology can be used to significantly support 
individuals with monitoring and overcoming their PD symptoms. The aim of the 
present study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly 
developed hybrid intervention that combines internet/PC with smartphone delivery 
to treat the symptoms of PD. The intervention is based on cognitive behavioral 
therapy and consists of six modules over a total of six weeks.
METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to 
evaluate the effects of a hybrid online training module for PD. Based on a power 
calculation (d =0.60; 1-β of 80%; α =0.05), 90 participants with mild to 
moderate panic symptoms with or without agoraphobia (as assessed by the Panic 
and Agoraphobia Scale) will be recruited from the general population and 
randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist 
control group. The primary outcome measure will be the severity of panic 
symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include depression, quality of life, and an 
observer-based rating of panic severity. Furthermore, data regarding acceptance 
and the usability of the smartphone app will be assessed. Assessments will take 
place at baseline as well as eight weeks, three months, and six months after 
randomization. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a 
societal perspective. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and 
per protocol.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this RCT is one of the first to examine the 
efficacy of a hybrid online training for adult PD. This study seeks to 
contribute to the emerging field of hybrid online training. If the intervention 
is efficacious, then research on this hybrid online training should be extended. 
The cost-effectiveness analysis will also indicate whether online training is an 
economical tool for treating PD among adults.

INTRODUCTION: There is a need to reduce physical inactivity and poor sleep 
health in the adult population to decrease chronic disease rates and the 
associated burden. Given the high prevalence of these risk behaviours, effective 
interventions with potential for wide reach are warranted.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this two-arm RCT will be to test the effect of 
a three month personalised mobile app intervention on two main outcomes: minutes 
of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and overall sleep quality. 
In addition, between-group changes in health-related quality of life and mental 
health status will be assessed as secondary outcomes. The pre-specified 
mediators and moderators include social cognitive factors, the neighbourhood 
environment, health (BMI, depression, anxiety, stress), sociodemographic factors 
(age, gender, education) and app usage. Assessments will be conducted after 
three months (primary endpoint) and six months (follow-up). The intervention 
will provide access to a specifically developed mobile app, through which 
participants can set goals for active minutes, daily step counts, resistance 
training, sleep times and sleep hygiene practice. The app also allows 
participants to log their behaviours daily and view progress bars as well as 
instant feedback in relation to goals. The personalised support system will 
consist of weekly summary reports, educational and instructional materials, 
prompts on disengagement and weekly facts.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of The University 
of Newcastle, Australia granted full approval: H-2016-0181. This study will 
assess the efficacy of a combined behaviour intervention, mechanisms of 
behaviour change and gather high-quality process data, all of which will help 
refine future trials. Dissemination of findings will include publication in a 
peer-reviewed journal and presentation at national or international conferences. 
Participants will receive a plain English summary report of results.

BACKGROUND: Depression often starts in adolescence making it an ideal time to 
intervene. We developed a universal cognitive behavioural therapy-based 
programme (MEMO CBT) to be delivered via multimedia mobile phone messages for 
teens.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled 
superiority trial in 15 high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, comparing MEMO 
CBT with a control programme [MEMO control] matched for intensity and type of 
message but with alternative content not targeting depression. The primary 
outcome was the change in score on the Children's Depression Rating 
Scale-Revised from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the change 
in scores in the self-reported Reynold's Adolescent Depression Rating 
Scale-Second Edition, the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire, suicidal ideation 
using selected items from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, the Pediatric Quality 
of Life questionnaire, 12-month period prevalence of the diagnosis of depressive 
disorder using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, 
and students' ratings of their satisfaction with the programme.
RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-five students (13-17 years old, mean 
14.3 years) were randomly assigned to MEMO CBT (426) or to MEMO Control (429). 
Participants (68% female) had a mean CDRS-R at baseline of 21.5 (SD: 5). Overall 
394 (93%) from the intervention group and 392 (91%) from the control group were 
followed up at 12 months. At the end of the intervention (approximately 9 weeks) 
the mean CDRS-R scores were 20.8 in the intervention group versus 20.4 in the 
control group, and at 12 months they were 22.4 versus 22.4 (p value for 
difference in change from baseline = 0.3). There was no obvious association 
between the amount of the intervention viewed by participants and outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of benefit from the mobile phone CBT 
intervention compared with a control programme. Universal depression prevention 
remains a challenge.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) poses significant 
global health challenges, with available treatments often insufficient in 
achieving remission for many patients. Digital health technologies, such as SMS 
text messaging-based cognitive behavioral therapy, offer accessible alternatives 
but may not reach all individuals. Email communication presents a secure avenue 
for health communication, yet its effectiveness compared to SMS text messaging 
in providing mental health support for patients with MDD remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the efficacy of email versus SMS text 
messaging as delivery platforms for supporting patients with MDD, addressing a 
critical gap in understanding optimal digital interventions for mental health 
care.
METHODS: A randomized noninferiority pilot trial was conducted, comparing 
outcomes for patients receiving 6-week daily supportive messages via email with 
those receiving messages via SMS text message. This duration corresponds to a 
minimum of 180 days of message delivery. The supportive messages maintained 
consistent length and structure across both delivery methods. Participants 
(N=66) were recruited from the Access 24/7 clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, among 
those who were diagnosed with MDD. The outcomes were measured at baseline and 6 
months after enrollment using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the World Health Organization 
Well-Being Index (WHO-5).
RESULTS: Most of the participants were females (n=43, 65%), aged between 26 and 
40 years (n=34, 55%), had high school education (n=35, 58%), employed (n=33, 
50%), and single (n=24, 36%). Again, most participants had had no history of any 
major physical illness (n=56, 85%) and (n=61, 92%) responded "No" to having a 
history of admission for treatment of mood disorders. There was no statistically 
significant difference in the mean changes in PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WHO-5 scores 
between the email and SMS text messaging groups (mean difference, 95% CI: -1.90, 
95% CI -6.53 to 2.74; 5.78, 95% CI -1.94 to 13.50; and 11.85, 95% CI -3.81 to 
27.51), respectively. Both supportive modalities showed potential in reducing 
depressive symptoms and improving quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings suggest that both email and SMS text messaging 
interventions have equivalent effectiveness in reducing depression symptoms 
among individuals with MDD. As digital technology continues to evolve, 
harnessing the power of multiple digital platforms for mental health 
interventions can significantly contribute to bridging the existing treatment 
gaps and improving the overall well-being of individuals with depressive 
conditions. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to confirm and 
expand upon these findings.

BACKGROUND: In India, women in rural areas have high rates of depression. They 
have poor access to mental healthcare resources and, hence, mental health 
symptoms remain largely unaddressed. Existing mobile telephone applications 
(apps) do not engage end-users, lack local language options, may not be 
socioculturally relevant and do not use audiovisual formats. We thus developed a 
mobile mental health app, Multiuser Interactive Health Response Application 
(MITHRA), to screen and provide brief behavioural intervention for mild to 
moderate depression among rural women attending self-help groups (SHGs) in 
India.
AIMS: This qualitative study explores the process and findings of focus groups 
conducted with SHG administrators and women to inform the iterative development 
of the MITHRA app.
METHOD: In total, 22 participants were interviewed (17 SHG participants and five 
administrators), and a thematic analysis of the data was conducted using the 
acceptability of interventions framework.
RESULTS: Frequent themes across the focus groups were affective attitude, 
burden, self-efficacy and perceived effectiveness. All women showed a positive 
attitude towards the app and depression interventions, while older women 
demonstrated less self-efficacy in using mobile mental health apps.
CONCLUSIONS: MITHRA is a promising app in the management of mild to moderate 
depression in women in SHG. With adequate training and education of family 
members, MITHRA has the potential to identify and treat women with mild to 
moderate depression.

BACKGROUND: Promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young 
people is a major global priority. Building emotional competence (EC) skills via 
a mobile app may be an effective, scalable and acceptable way to do this. 
However, few large-scale controlled trials have examined the efficacy of mobile 
apps in promoting mental health in young people; none have tailored the app to 
individual profiles.
METHOD/DESIGN: The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults cohort 
multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) involves a longitudinal prospective 
cohort to examine well-being, mental health and EC in 16-22 year olds across 
12 months. Within the cohort, eligible participants are entered to either the 
PREVENT trial (if selected EC scores at baseline within worst-performing 
quartile) or to the PROMOTE trial (if selected EC scores not within 
worst-performing quartile). In both trials, participants are randomised (i) to 
continue with usual practice, repeated assessments and a self-monitoring app; 
(ii) to additionally receive generic cognitive-behavioural therapy self-help in 
app; (iii) to additionally receive personalised EC self-help in app. In total, 
2142 participants aged 16 to 22 years, with no current or past history of major 
depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis will be recruited across UK, Germany, 
Spain, and Belgium. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 1, 3 
and 12 months post-randomisation. Primary endpoint and outcome for PREVENT is 
level of depression symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at 3 months; 
primary endpoint and outcome for PROMOTE is emotional well-being assessed on the 
Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale at 3 months. Depressive symptoms, 
anxiety, well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and 
cost-effectiveness are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and 
potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored.
CONCLUSIONS: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the causal role 
of learning EC skills using interventions delivered via mobile phone apps with 
respect to promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young 
people. This knowledge will be used to develop and disseminate innovative 
evidence-based, feasible, and effective Mobile-health public health strategies 
for preventing poor mental health and promoting well-being.

Collaborative care management is an evidence-based approach to integrated 
psychosocial care for patients with comorbid cancer and depression. Prior work 
highlights challenges in patient-provider collaboration in navigating parallel 
cancer care and psychosocial care journeys of these patients. We design and 
deploy SCOPE, a platform for technology-enhanced collaborative care combining a 
patient-facing mobile app with a provider-facing registry. We examine SCOPE 
through a total of 45 interviews with patients and providers conducted in 
SCOPE's 15 months of design and development and 24 months of SCOPE's deployment 
for actual care in 6 cancer clinics. We find that: (1) SCOPE supported patient 
engagement in its underlying collaborative care and behavioral activation 
interventions, (2) patient-generated data in SCOPE improved patient-provider 
collaboration between and within in-person sessions, (3) SCOPE supported 
providers in delivering care and improved care team collaboration, (4) 
experience with SCOPE created evolving expectations for collaboration around 
data, and (5) SCOPE's deployment in actual care surfaced important 
implementation barriers. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of 
designing for engagement with behavioral health interventions, negotiating 
patient data sharing and provider responsiveness, supporting personalized 
self-tracking goals in evidence-based interventions, exploring the role of 
digital health navigators in technology-enhanced care, and the need for 
flexibility in aligning technology-supported interventions to patient needs.

Many smartphone applications (apps) for mental health (MHapps) are available to 
the public. However, few have been the subject of a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT), and the change processes that are hypothesized to mediate claimed effects 
have not been previously studied. This RCT compared the efficacy of three 
publicly available MHapps to a waitlist control condition in a community sample, 
in which no MHapp was provided. The three MHapps included cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) toolkit app MoodKit, mood tracking app MoodPrism, and CBT strategy 
app MoodMission. Participants were randomly allocated to each condition, 
completed a baseline assessment, downloaded their allocated MHapp, and completed 
a second assessment 30 days later, with n = 226 included in final analyses (81% 
female; M age = 34 years). Compared to the control condition, all MHapp groups 
experienced increases in mental wellbeing, MoodKit and MoodMission groups 
experienced decreases in depression, and no groups experienced effects on 
anxiety. Mediated regressions revealed that increasing coping self-efficacy, 
rather than emotional self-awareness or mental health literacy, was the 
underlying process contributing to effects on mental health for all three 
MHapps. MHapps appear to be an effective solution for improving public mental 
health, notably by improving users' confidence in their ability to cope.

BACKGROUND: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an often chronic and impairing 
psychiatric condition. Research shows that smartphone-delivered cognitive 
behavior therapy (CBT) with coaching may be a scalable and effective treatment 
for BDD. However, evidence for long-term gain maintenance is limited.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to examine the long-term outcomes 
of a smartphone-based CBT for BDD.
METHOD: Adults with a primary diagnosis of BDD who completed a 12-week course of 
smartphone-delivered CBT with coach support were evaluated 3- and 12-months 
posttreatment. Symptom severity, remission and responder status were assessed 
with the clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale modified for BDD 
(BDD-YBOCS). Secondary outcomes were also evaluated and included BDD-related 
insight, depression, functioning and quality of life. Data were analyzed using 
four different approaches to missing data, with maximum likelihood estimation as 
the main approach.
RESULTS: There was significant attrition from posttreatment (n = 57) to 3-month 
(n = 49) and 12-month (n = 33) follow-up. The mean BDD-YBOCS severity score 
remained stable during the follow-up period [Estimated Mean (SE) at 
posttreatment, 3-months, and 12-months = 18.7(1.1), 18.9(1.2) and 18.8(1.3), 
respectively]. The proportion of participants responding to treatment and in 
remission remained relatively unchanged as well (63 % responders and 46 % 
remitters at posttreatment, 54 % and 35 % at 3-month follow-up, and 61 % and 
37 % at 12-month follow-up, respectively). Posttreatment gains in BDD-related 
insight, functioning, and quality of life were maintained; there were small 
increases in depression (ES = 0.36) from posttreatment to 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements after coach-supported smartphone-based CBT for BDD are 
maintained one year after treatment.

BACKGROUND: The widespread occurrence and devastating impact of adolescent 
depression warrant health service research focused on feasible and acceptable 
digital health tools to supplement evidence-based intervention (EBI) efforts, 
particularly in the context of shelter-in-place guidelines disrupting youth 
socialization and service use in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the 
promise of SMS text message interventions to enhance EBI engagement, our team 
developed the HealthySMS system as an adjunct to one of the most empirically 
supported interventions for adolescent depression: cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) group services. The system sends daily SMS text messages requesting 
responses assessing mood, thoughts, and activities; weekly attendance reminder 
messages; daily tips about adherence (eg, a prompt for activity completion); and 
personalized responses based on participants' texts.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of 
HealthySMS in a real-world setting and explore potential mechanisms of change in 
EBI engagement, before evaluating the system's impact on adolescents' group CBT 
engagement and, ultimately, depression outcomes.
METHODS: Over the course of 2020, we invited all 20 adolescents receiving CBT 
group services for depression at an outpatient psychiatry clinic to enroll in 
our HealthySMS study; ultimately, 17 (85%) adolescents agreed to participate. We 
tracked participant initiation and engagement with the HealthySMS system as well 
as the content of SMS text message responses to HealthySMS. We also invited each 
participant to engage in a semistructured interview to gather additional 
qualitative inputs on the system.
RESULTS: All (n=17, 100%) research participants invited agreed to receive 
HealthySMS messages, and 94% (16/17) of the participants maintained use during 
the first month without opting out. We uncovered meaningful qualitative themes 
regarding the feasibility and acceptability of HealthySMS, as well as its 
potential impact on EBI engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of this pilot study suggest that 
HealthySMS adjunct to adolescent CBT group depression services is feasible and 
acceptable, as evidenced by high rates of HealthySMS initiation and low rates of 
dropout, as well as meaningful themes uncovered from participants' qualitative 
feedback. In addition, the findings provide evidence regarding iterative 
improvements to the HealthySMS system and research protocol, as well as 
potential mechanisms of change for enhanced EBI engagement and, ultimately, 
adolescent depression outcomes, which can be used in future effectiveness 
research.

sample of individuals with depressive symptoms over a 6-week follow-up period.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 190 adults from the general population who 
report high levels of depressive symptoms (defined as a score ≥ 14 on the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II). Participants will attend a screening session and will 
be randomised to intervention or control procedures, repeated five times over 
consecutive days (Monday to Friday). A follow-up session will take place at 
end-of -treatment, 2-weeks and 6-weeks after training. Our primary study outcome 
will be depressive symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory- II (rated over the past 
two weeks). Our secondary outcomes are: depressive symptoms, Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression; anxiety symptoms, Beck Anxiety Inventory (rated over the 
past month); positive affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 
'how you feel right now'); negative affect, Positive and Negative Affect 
Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); emotion sensitivity, Emotion 
Recognition Task (test phase); approach motivation and persistence, the Fishing 
Game; and depressive interpretation bias, Scrambled Sentences Test.
DISCUSSION: This study is of a novel cognitive bias modification technique that 
targets biases in emotional processing characteristic of depression, and can be 
delivered automatically via computer, Internet or Smartphone. It therefore has 
potential to be a valuable cost-effective adjunctive treatment for depression 
which may be used together with more traditional psychotherapy, 
cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy.

Evaluation of ReminX as a Behavioral Intervention for Mild to Moderate Dementia.

Filoteo JV, Cox EM, Split M, Gross M, Culjat M, Keene D.

Dementia is a growing global challenge that is difficult to treat. 
Pharmaceutical treatment approaches have had limited success, leading to an 
increased focus on nonpharmaceutical approaches to the treatment of dementia. A 
clinical pilot study was performed to evaluate whether ReminX digital 
therapeutic software, based on reminiscence therapy, has the potential to 
improve emotional functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related 
dementias. ReminX allows the uploading of pictures and narration to create 
slideshow stories depicting important moments in the patient's life. Fourteen 
patients were evaluated in their home, and their emotional health was assessed 
both before and after using ReminX. Results indicated that patients reported 
significantly less anxiety, depression, and overall emotional distress after 
having viewed their story. Furthermore, patient's caregivers also reported that 
the patient appeared less emotionally distressed. The effect sizes for the 
significant results ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. These effect sizes, which were 
larger than anticipated, suggest that digitally-delivered reminiscence therapy 
can have an immediate and positive impact on emotional functioning in patients 
with dementia. In addition, the accessibility, scalability, and ease of use of 
the software platform suggests that this technology holds great promise as a 
product for use in both the home and senior care settings.

BACKGROUND: Psychological online interventions (POIs) reduce depression but we 
know little about factors influencing their effectiveness. We evaluated a new, 
brief POI for depression and conducted exploratory moderator analyses.
METHODS: In this online trial (German Clinical Trials Register; DRKS00011045), 
we allocated participants to treatment as usual (TAU; n = 67) or POI (n = 65). 
At first, we randomized participants; later we allocated participants based on 
depression severity in order to counter baseline differences. The unguided POI 
addressed behavioral activation and depressive thinking in a single module with 
25 webpages (including a smartphone application). We did one assessment at 
baseline and a post-assessment four weeks later.
RESULTS: At post-assessment, depression (p = .586), behavioral activation 
(p = .332), and dysfunctional attitudes (p = .499) did not differ between 
groups. When concurrent treatments (medication/psychotherapy) remained 
constant/decreased, the POI outperformed TAU (p = .031). POI-participants with 
lower willingness to change (p = .030) or higher education (p = .017) were less 
likely to worsen (i.e., experience increased depressive symptoms) compared to 
TAU.
DISCUSSION: The targeted sample size was not reached, measurements were 
self-reported, and randomization failed. The POI's content may have been too 
limited. Concurrent treatments, which were more often sought out by TAU 
participants, diminished group differences and should be considered in future 
studies. Brief POIs may protect against worsening of depressive symptoms among 
highly educated participants or those with low willingness to change.

OBJECTIVES: This mixed-methods study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability 
and preliminary effectiveness of an interactive digital training programme for 
non-specialist supporters providing a guided self-help intervention for 
postnatal depression (PND).
METHODS: A total of 49 non-specialist trainees participated. Six digital 
training modules were flexibly delivered over a 5-week period. Training included 
a chatroom, moderated by a supervised assistant psychologist. Quantitatively, 
feasibility was assessed via participation and retention levels; acceptability 
was examined using course evaluation questionnaires; and effectiveness was 
measured pre-test-post-test quantitatively using a self-report questionnaire and 
pre-post using scenario questions. Participant focus groups explored 
feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness.
RESULTS: The training was feasible; 41 completed the course and 42 were assessed 
at follow-up. Quantitative course evaluation and thematic analysis of focus 
group feedback demonstrated high training acceptability. RANOVAs indicated 
training significantly improved knowledge and confidence pre- to post-test. 
There were demonstrable increases in specific skills at post-test as assessed 
via clinical scenarios.
CONCLUSION: This training is a feasible, acceptable and effective way to upskill 
non-specialists in supporting treatment for PND, however supervised practice is 
recommended to ensure participants embed knowledge competently into practice. 
The training offers an effective first step in upskilling non-specialist 
supporters to support women with PND treatment at scale.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder, especially among older adults, 
with a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) and is associated with 
various comorbidities. Traditional pharmacotherapy for insomnia is often 
unsuitable for older adults because of potential drug interactions and side 
effects, making nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) more appropriate. However, delivering CBT-I in a 
traditional face-to-face setting poses challenges including accessibility and 
adherence, particularly for older adults.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an information and 
communication technology (ICT)-based CBT-I program, "Smart Sleep," specifically 
designed to improve insomnia among community-dwelling older persons.
METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 older 
participants from Incheon, South Korea. Participants were divided into an 
intervention group, which used the Smart Sleep mobile app, and a control group. 
The intervention group received 8 weeks of non-face-to-face CBT-I through the 
app, which included sleep diaries, relaxation exercises, and real-time 
consultations. Outcomes were measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8, with a 
focus on insomnia severity, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, dysfunctional 
beliefs about sleep, depression, and QoL.
RESULTS: The intervention group showed significant improvements in insomnia 
severity, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep 
compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference in 
the QoL between the 2 groups (F2,114=0.998, P=.37). Participation rates in the 
Smart Sleep program were high, with a 94% completion rate for sleep diary tasks 
and 100% participation in real-time consultations. In addition, subgroup 
analysis based on sleep medication use showed significant improvements in 
insomnia severity for both medicated and nonmedicated participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICT-based CBT-I program "Smart Sleep" effectively improved 
sleep-related outcomes among older participants, demonstrating the potential of 
non-face-to-face interventions in managing insomnia in this population. The 
program is user-friendly, and ICT-based coaching contributed to high engagement. 
To ensure broader access for older adults, distribution through community 
welfare or public health centers is recommended.

The Supportive Accountability Inventory: Psychometric properties of a measure of 
supportive accountability in coached digital interventions.

BACKGROUND: One of the most widely used coaching models is Supportive 
Accountability (SA) which aims to provide intervention users with clear 
expectations for intervention use, regular monitoring, and a sense that coaches 
are trustworthy, benevolent, and have domain expertise. However, few measures 
exist to study the role of the SA model on coached digital interventions. We 
developed the Supportive Accountability Inventory (SAI) and evaluated the 
underlying factor structure and psychometric properties of this brief 
self-report measure.
METHOD: Using data from a two-arm randomized trial of a remote intervention for 
major depressive disorder (telephone CBT [tCBT] or a stepped care model of 
web-based CBT [iCBT] and tCBT), we conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis on 
the SAI item pool and explored the final SAI's relationship to iCBT engagement 
as well as to depression outcomes. Participants in our analyses (n = 52) 
included those randomized to a receive iCBT, but were not stepped up to tCBT due 
to insufficient response to iCBT, had not remitted prior to the 10-week 
assessment point, and completed the pool of 8 potential SAI items.
RESULTS: The best fitting EFA model included only 6 items from the original pool 
of 8 and contained two factors: Monitoring and Expectation. Final model fit was 
mixed, but acceptable (χ 2 (4) = 5.24, p = 0.26; RMSR = 0.03; RMSEA = 0.091; 
TLI = 0.967). Internal consistency was acceptable at α = 0.68. The SAI 
demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity. The SAI at the 
10-week/mid-treatment mark was significantly associated with the number of days 
of iCBT use (r = 0.29, p = .037), but, contrary to expectations, was not 
predictive of either PHQ-9 scores (F(2,46) = 0.14, p = .89) or QIDS-C scores 
(F(2,46) = 0.84, p = .44) at post-treatment.
CONCLUSION: The SAI is a brief measure of the SA framework constructs. Continued 
development to improve the SAI and expand the constructs it assesses is 
necessary, but the SAI represents the first step towards a measure of a coaching 
protocol that can support both coached digital mental health intervention 
adherence and improved outcomes.

At-risk adolescents' comprehension of, and preferences for, the content of a 
text-message (SMS) delivered, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based 
depression prevention intervention was investigated using two qualitative 
studies. Adolescents with depressive symptoms and a history of peer violence 
were recruited from an urban emergency department. Forty-one participants 
completed semi-structured qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis using 
deductive and inductive codes were used to capture a priori and emerging themes. 
Five major themes were identified: CBT-based messages resonated with at-risk 
adolescents; high levels of peer violence, comorbid symptoms, and prior exposure 
to the mental health system were variables affecting preferred content; 
participants endorsed emotional regulation messages, but found mindfulness 
content difficult to understand via SMS; cognitive awareness and restructuring 
content was most acceptable when framed by self-efficacy content; adolescent 
participants generated applicable CBT content in their own voices. Overall, 
CBT-informed content was able to be distilled into 160-character text messages 
without losing its comprehensibility.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a common diagnosis among adolescents. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended as the first line of treatment. 
Digital health interventions, such as apps, could contribute to treatment. 
Advantages could be easy accessibility and availability, reduced time for 
face-to-face therapy, and the ability to intensify therapy by incorporating it 
into the patients' everyday lives. Challenges such as low adherence rates are 
common in digital health interventions. Therefore, they need to undergo rigorous 
testing for feasibility and effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: An evaluated, cognitive behavioral therapy-based face-to-face therapy 
program for depression in adolescents was transformed into an app called 
e-MICHI. This study examined its feasibility and efficacy for use in blended 
therapy in outpatient settings.
METHODS: Adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with major depressive disorder 
receiving outpatient care were recruited from 2 university hospitals (n=36 
included in analysis). The e-MICHI intervention combined daily app engagement 
over 6 weeks with 3 face-to-face sessions with a therapist. Feasibility was 
measured using various variables, including an adherence score (0=no or little 
patient engagement to 3=excellent engagement) and engagement rates (number of 
modules completed, number of messages sent by participants via the in-app 
messenger), satisfaction ratings from both participants and therapists, as well 
as participants' ratings of the usefulness of the antidepressant strategies 
covered in the app and the transfer of these strategies to everyday practice. 
Trends of efficacy were evaluated from multiple perspectives (participant 
self-rating, independent rater, or therapist), using the Beck Depression 
Inventory-II, the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, and the Clinical 
Global Impressions-Severity Scale. Feasibility metrics were assessed by 
analyzing their central tendency and dispersion, efficacy data were analyzed 
using a repeated measures ANOVA.
RESULTS: e-MICHI was positively evaluated by both participants and therapists 
(participants: mean 7.3, SD 1.2 and therapists: mean 7.3, SD 1.1, on a scale 
from 0=bad to 10=excellent). Participants demonstrated high adherence rates 
(nearly 80%, n=25, received a "good" or "excellent" adherence score) and showed 
overall good engagement (app modules completed [maximum 6]: mean 5.03, SD 1.27 
and messages sent via messenger: mean 23, SD 22.1). Participants rated the 
psychoeducational content of the app as particularly useful and reported 
consistent practice of the e-MICHI strategies in everyday life. Use of the app 
was associated with a significant reduction of depressive symptoms (before app 
use vs 3-month follow-up, Beck Depression Inventory-II: mean -6.76, SD 11.49, 
P=.01; Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised: mean -16.45, SD 16.76, 
P<.001; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale: mean -1.1, SD 1.24, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: While acknowledging its limitations, such as the small number of 
participants and the limited validity concerning efficacy, this study confirms 
the feasibility of e-MICHI for treating adolescent depression in outpatient 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Work-related stress is a significant problem for both people and 
organizations. It may lead to mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, 
resulting in increased work absences and disabilities. Scalable interventions to 
prevent and manage harmful stress can be delivered with the help of technology 
tools to support self-observations and skills training.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the P4Well 
intervention in treatment of stress-related psychological problems. P4Well is a 
novel intervention which combines modern psychotherapy (the cognitive behavioral 
therapy and the acceptance and commitment therapy) with personal health 
technologies to deliver the intervention via multiple channels, includinggroup 
meetings, Internet/Web portal, mobile phone applications, and personal 
monitoring devices.
METHODS: This pilot study design was a small-scale randomized controlled trial 
that compared the P4Well intervention with a waiting list control group. In 
addition to personal health technologies for self-assessment, the intervention 
consisted of 3 psychologist-assisted group meetings. Self-assessed psychological 
measures through questionnaires were collected offline pre- and 
post-intervention, and 6 months after the intervention for the intervention 
group. Acceptance and usage of technology tools were measured with user 
experience questionnaires and usage logs.
RESULTS: A total of 24 subjects were randomized: 11 participants were followed 
up in the intervention group (1 was lost to follow-up) and 12 participants did 
not receive any intervention (control group). Depressive and psychological 
symptoms decreased and self-rated health and working ability increased. All 
participants reported they had benefited from the intervention. All technology 
tools had active users and 10/11 participants used at least 1 tool actively. 
Physiological measurements with personal feedback were considered the most 
useful intervention component.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the feasibility of the intervention and suggest 
that it had positive effects on psychological symptoms, self-rated health, and 
self-rated working ability. The intervention seemed to have a positive impact on 
certain aspects of burnout and job strain, such as cynicism and over-commitment. 
Future studies need to investigate the effectiveness, benefits, and possible 
problems of psychological interventions which incorporate new technologies.

BACKGROUND: Fully automated digital interventions delivered via smartphone apps 
have proven efficacious for a wide variety of mental health outcomes. An 
important aspect is that they are accessible at a low cost, thereby increasing 
their potential public impact and reducing disparities. However, a major 
challenge to their successful implementation is the phenomenon of users dropping 
out early.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the factors influencing 
early dropout in a sample of self-selected users of a virtual agent (VA)-based 
behavioral intervention for managing insomnia, named KANOPEE, which is freely 
available in France.
METHODS: From January 2021 to December 2022, of the 9657 individuals, aged 18 
years or older, who downloaded and completed the KANOPEE screening interview and 
had either subclinical or clinical insomnia symptoms, 4295 (44.5%) dropped out 
(ie, did not return to the app to continue filling in subsequent assessments). 
The primary outcome was a binary variable: having dropped out after completing 
the screening assessment (early dropout) or having completed all the treatment 
phases (n=551). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify 
predictors of dropout among a set of sociodemographic, clinical, and sleep diary 
variables, and users' perceptions of the treatment program, collected during the 
screening interview.
RESULTS: The users' mean age was 47.95 (SD 15.21) years. Of those who dropped 
out early and those who completed the treatment, 65.1% (3153/4846) were women 
and 34.9% (1693/4846) were men. Younger age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.98, 95% 
CI 0.97-0.99), lower education level (compared to middle school; high school: 
AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90; bachelor's degree: AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23-0.52; 
master's degree or higher: AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.55), poorer nocturnal sleep 
(sleep efficiency: AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96; number of nocturnal awakenings: 
AOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23), and more severe depression symptoms (AOR 1.12, 95% 
CI 1.04-1.21) were significant predictors of dropping out. When measures of 
perceptions of the app were included in the model, perceived benevolence and 
credibility of the VA decreased the odds of dropout (AOR 0.91, 95% CI 
0.85-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: As in traditional face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia, the presence of significant depression symptoms plays an important 
role in treatment dropout. This variable represents an important target to 
address to increase early engagement with fully automated insomnia management 
programs. Furthermore, our results support the contention that a VA can provide 
relevant user stimulation that will eventually pay out in terms of user 
engagement.

BACKGROUND: Parents of children treated for cancer may experience psychological 
difficulties including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. Digital 
interventions, such as internet-administered cognitive behavioral therapy, offer 
an accessible and flexible means to support parents. However, engagement with 
and adherence to digital interventions remain a significant challenge, 
potentially limiting efficacy. Understanding factors influencing user engagement 
and adherence is crucial for enhancing the acceptability, feasibility, and 
efficacy of these interventions. We developed an internet-administered, guided, 
low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (LICBT)-based self-help intervention 
for parents of children treated for cancer, (EJDeR [internetbaserad självhjälp 
för föräldrar till barn som avslutat en behandling mot cancer or internet-based 
self-help for parents of children who have completed cancer treatment]). EJDeR 
included 2 LICBT techniques-behavioral activation and worry management. 
Subsequently, we conducted the ENGAGE feasibility trial and EJDeR was found to 
be acceptable and feasible. However, intervention adherence rates were 
marginally under progression criteria.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) describe user engagement with the EJDeR 
intervention and examine whether (2) sociodemographic characteristics differed 
between adherers and nonadherers, (3) depression and anxiety scores differed 
between adherers and nonadherers at baseline, (4) user engagement differed 
between adherers and nonadherers, and (5) user engagement differed between 
fathers and mothers.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of ENGAGE data, including 71 
participants. User engagement data were collected through log-data tracking, for 
example, communication with e-therapists, homework submissions, log-ins, minutes 
working with EJDeR, and modules completed. Chi-square tests examined differences 
between adherers and nonadherers and fathers and mothers concerning categorical 
data. Independent-samples t tests examined differences regarding continuous 
variables.
RESULTS: Module completion rates were higher among those who worked with 
behavioral activation as their first LICBT module versus worry management. Of 
the 20 nonadherers who opened the first LICBT module allocated, 30% (n=6) opened 
behavioral activation and 70% (n=14) opened worry management. No significant 
differences in sociodemographic characteristics were found. Nonadherers who 
opened behavioral activation as the first LICBT module allocated had a 
significantly higher level of depression symptoms at baseline than adherers. No 
other differences in depression and anxiety scores between adherers and 
nonadherers were found. Minutes working with EJDeR, number of log-ins, days 
using EJDeR, number of written messages sent to e-therapists, number of written 
messages sent to participants, and total number of homework exercises submitted 
were significantly higher among adherers than among nonadherers. There were no 
significant differences between fathers and mothers regarding user engagement 
variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Straightforward techniques, such as behavioral activation, may be 
well-suited for digital delivery, and more complex techniques, such as worry 
management, may require modifications to improve user engagement. User 
engagement was measured behaviorally, for example, through log-data tracking, 
and future research should measure emotional and cognitive components of 
engagement.

Addressing Cultural Contexts in the Management of Stress via Narrative and 
Mobile Technology.

In developing applications for stress management and mental health, developers 
have largely ignored cultural context in design, opting instead to produce apps 
for a general audience. However, apps designed without a specific population in 
mind actually have limited reach. Generally stress trackers and socalled 
"therapists in your pocket", tend to be lost among a jungle of other generic 
apps that appeal only to the quantified self population and those already 
predisposed to help-seeking behavior. To reach a broader audience, designing for 
a specific population may have appeal. The AppHappy Project's Journey to the 
West is a mobile app being developed by a multidisciplinary group of students at 
the University of Pennsylvania. The objective is to promote better stress 
management and mental health among Asian international college students and 
facilitate their social integration with the general student population. With a 
prevalence of depression twice that of domestic college students, a reluctance 
to engage in help-seeking behavior due to stigma, and the challenge of cultural 
integration, creating interventions for this population requires a different 
approach to app-mediated therapy. Journey to the West packages bite-sized pieces 
of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques within the framework of a 
role-playing game. Every element of its design-from its characters to its art 
style, from its narrative to its mechanics to its approach to community 
features-is rooted in a culturally appropriate context. An avatar serves as a 
surrogate of self while experiencing externalized stressors. Each quest blends 
therapeutic elements into gameplay with the goal of building resilience towards 
stressful events.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions are often standardized and assumed to 
work the same for all users; however, we may be missing cultural differences in 
the experiences of interventions that may impact how and if an intervention is 
effective.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess qualitative feedback from 
participants to determine if there were differences between Spanish speakers and 
English speakers. Daily text messages were sent to patients as an adjunct to 
group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression.
METHODS: Messages inquired about mood and about specific themes (thoughts, 
activities, social interactions) of a manualized group CBT intervention. There 
were thirty-nine patients who participated in the text messaging pilot study. 
The average age of the participants was 53 years (SD 10.4; range of 23-72).
RESULTS: Qualitative feedback from Spanish speakers highlighted feelings of 
social support, whereas English speakers noted increased introspection and 
self-awareness of their mood state.
CONCLUSIONS: These cultural differences should be explored further, as they may 
impact the effect of supportive mobile health interventions.

OBJECTIVES: Digitally native university students face challenges to their 
well-being and up to a third develop mental health problems. "Whitu: seven ways 
in seven days" is an app based on positive psychology, cognitive behaviour 
therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation principles.
METHODS: Ninety-first year university students (45 per arm) participated in a 
randomised controlled trial of Whitu against a university self-help website ("Be 
Well"). Primary outcomes were changes in well-being on the World Health 
Organisation 5-item well-being index (WHO-5) and the short Warwick-Edinburgh 
mental well-being scale (SWEMWBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in 
depression, anxiety, self-compassion, stress, sleep and self-reported 
acceptability of the app.
RESULTS: At 4 weeks (primary endpoint), participants in the intervention group 
experienced significantly higher mental well-being (mean difference: 2.53 
(95%CI: 0.53, 4.52); p = 0.013) and significantly lower depression (-4.23 
(-8.32, -0.15); p = 0.042), compared to controls. Emotional well-being was 
greater in the intervention group at 3 months (12.23 (3.93, 20.54; p = 0.004). 
Other outcomes were similar between groups. User feedback was positive, with 88% 
saying they would recommend the app to a friend.
CONCLUSIONS: Whitu is an acceptable, effective, scalable and multi-modal means 
of improving some aspects of well-being and mental health among university 
students.

BACKGROUND: Harboring dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions contributes to the 
development and maintenance of depression. A central goal of cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression is to invalidate such cognitions via 
cognitive reappraisal (CR). However, relatively low remission rates and high 
dropout rates in CBT demonstrate the need for further improvement. Potentially, 
the effects of CBT could be enhanced by addressing not only dysfunctional 
depressogenic cognitions but also body states associated with depression. This 
may be done, for example, by systematically pairing the invalidation of 
depressogenic cognitions with the performance of antidepressive kinesthesia.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the feasibility and clinical potential of 
a smartphone-based cognitive restructuring task that required users to 
deliberately perform antidepressive kinesthesia in conjunction with the 
rejection of depressogenic statements and the affirmation of antidepressive 
statements. This feasibility study was conducted as a precursor to a large-scale 
randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: In total, 10 healthy participants engaged in a single 90-120-minute 
session of smartphone-based CR training. During the training, they completed 2 
phases in which they were required to reject 20 depressogenic and affirm 20 
antidepressive statements, respectively. Diagnostic assessments were conducted 1 
week (T1) before and directly prior (T2) to the training, and again directly 
posttraining (T3) and at a 2-week follow-up posttraining (T4). Feasibility 
outcomes assessed at T3 included intervention safety recorded by study 
therapists, compliance, technical feasibility, usability assessed using the 
Short Version of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S), and acceptability 
assessed using the UEQ-S and self-developed items. Preliminary clinical 
potential was evaluated via single-item ratings of current depressed and 
positive mood assessed continuously during the training. Feasibility outcomes 
were analyzed descriptively, and clinical potential was examined using 
paired-sample t tests of pre and post ratings of mood at each training phase.
RESULTS: Overall, the results indicated that the training was safe, feasible, 
and usable (UEQ-S pragmatic quality scale: mean 1.45, SD 0.71). However, 
acceptance was limited (UEQ-S hedonic quality scale: mean 1.05, SD 0.79). While 
80% (8/10) of the participants were generally satisfied with the training, 80% 
(8/10) would recommend it to a friend, 90% (9/10) found it interesting, and 80% 
(8/10) rated it as "leading edge," 40% (4/10) to 70% (7/10) did not consider it 
particularly helpful and 50% (5/10) found it repetitive. Preliminary results 
regarding clinical potential were promising, with significant increases in 
positive mood (rejection: Hedges g=0.63; affirmation: Hedges g=0.25), whereas 
changes in depressed mood were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a 
smartphone-based CR training augmented with validating and invalidating 
kinesthesia. This provided valuable insights for further optimizing the 
intervention for the subsequent randomized controlled trial, but also potential 
similar interventions. If future studies confirm their clinical potential, such 
interventions offer a promising approach to enhancing CBT for depression.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with chronic somatic conditions 
have an increased risk of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. Internet- 
and mobile-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) might be one possibility 
to extend the access to evidence-based treatments. Studies suggest that guided 
iCBT can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in AYA. However, little is known 
about the effectiveness of iCBT for AYA with chronic somatic conditions and 
comorbid symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in routine care. Evidence on the 
(cost-)effectiveness of iCBT is essential for its implementation in health care.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This multicentre two-armed randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) aims to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of guided iCBT (youthCOACHCD) 
in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to enhanced treatment as usual 
(TAU+) in AYA aged 12-21 years with one of three chronic somatic conditions 
(type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis). AYA with 
one of the chronic somatic conditions and elevated symptoms of anxiety or 
depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] and/or Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder [GAD-7] Screener score ≥ 7) will be eligible for inclusion. We will 
recruit 212 patients (2 × n = 106) in routine care through three German patient 
registries. Assessments will take place at baseline and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 
months, and 12 months post-randomization. The primary outcome will be combined 
depression and anxiety symptom severity as measured with the PHQ Anxiety and 
Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of 
life, coping strategies, self-efficacy, stress-related personal growth, social 
support, behavioural activation, adjustment and trauma-related symptoms, 
automatic thoughts, intervention satisfaction, working alliance, and Internet 
usage. The cost-effectiveness will be determined, and potential moderators and 
mediators of intervention effects will be explored.
DISCUSSION: iCBT might implicate novel ways to increase the access to 
evidence-based interventions in this specific population. The distinct focus on 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of youthCOACHCD in patients with chronic 
somatic conditions, as well as intervention safety, will most likely provide 
important new insights in the field of paediatric e-mental health. A particular 
strength of the present study is its implementation directly into routine 
collaborative health care. As such, this study will provide important insights 
for health care policy and stakeholders and indicate how iCBT can be integrated 
into existing health care systems.

Digital health applications are becoming increasingly important for assessing 
and monitoring the wellbeing of people suffering from mental health conditions 
like depression. A common target of said applications is to predict the results 
of self-assessed Patient-Health-Questionnaires (PHQ), indicating current symptom 
severity of depressive individuals. Many of the currently available approaches 
to predict PHQ scores use passive data, e.g., from smartphones. However, there 
are several other scores and data besides PHQ, e.g., the Behavioral Activation 
for Depression Scale-Short Form (BADSSF), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies 
Depression Scale (CESD), or the Personality Dynamics Diary (PDD), all of which 
can be effortlessly collected on a daily basis. In this work, we explore the 
potential of using actively-collected data to predict and forecast daily PHQ-2 
scores on a newly-collected longitudinal dataset. We obtain a best MAE of 1.417 
for daily prediction of PHQ-2 scores, which specifically in the used dataset 
have a range of 0 to 12, using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, as well 
as a best MAE of 1.914 for forecasting PHQ-2 scores using data from up to the 
last 7 days. This illustrates the additive value that can be obtained by 
incorporating actively-collected data in a depression monitoring application.

BACKGROUND: Intensive lifestyle interventions in pregnancy have shown success in 
limiting gestational weight gain, but the effects on mood and quality of life in 
pregnancy and postpartum are less known. The purpose was to quantify changes in 
mental and physical quality of life and depressive symptoms across pregnancy and 
the postpartum period, to determine the association between gestational weight 
gain and change in mood and quality of life, and to assess the effect of a 
behavioral intervention targeting excess gestational weight gain on these 
outcomes.
METHODS: A three group parallel-arm randomized controlled pilot trial of 54 
pregnant women who were overweight or obese was conducted to test whether the 
SmartMoms® intervention decreased the proportion of women with excess 
gestational weight gain. Individuals randomized to Usual Care (n = 17) did not 
receive any weight management services from interventionists. Individuals 
randomized to the SmartMoms® intervention (n = 37) were provided with behavioral 
weight management counseling by interventionists either in clinic (In-Person, 
n = 18) or remotely through a smartphone application (Phone, n = 19). In a 
subset of 43 women, mood and mental and physical quality of life were assessed 
with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Rand 12-Item short form, 
respectively, in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, 1-2 months postpartum, and 
12 months postpartum.
RESULTS: The SmartMoms® intervention and Usual Care groups had higher depressive 
symptoms (p < 0.03 for SmartMoms® intervention, p < 0.01 for Usual Care) and 
decreased physical health (p < 0.01) from early to late pregnancy. Both groups 
returned to early pregnancy mood and physical quality of life postpartum. Mental 
health did not change from early to late pregnancy (p = 0.8), from early 
pregnancy to 1-2 months (p = 0.5), or from early pregnancy to 12 months 
postpartum (p = 0.9), respectively. There were no significant intervention 
effects. Higher gestational weight gain was associated with worsened mood and 
lower physical quality of life across pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: High depressive symptoms and poor quality of life may be 
interrelated with the incidence of excess gestational weight gain. The 
behavioral gestational weight gain intervention did not significantly impact 
these outcomes, but mood and quality of life should be considered within future 
interventions and clinical practice to effectively limit excess gestational 
weight gain.

Common approaches to the psychological treatment of distressing voice hearing 
experiences, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, aim to promote more adaptive 
cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses to these experiences. Digital 
technologies such as smartphones show promise for supporting and enhancing these 
treatments by linking immediate therapeutic settings to the context of daily 
life. Two promising technologies include ecological momentary assessment and 
intervention (EMA/I), which may offer a means of advanced assessment and support 
in daily life, and inform the tailoring of interventions to suit individual 
needs. In this study, a highly novel intervention approach was developed 
involving four face-to-face sessions with a psychologist blended with EMA/I 
between sessions in order to improve coping with distressing voice hearing 
experiences. The authors describe the background and development of this 
approach along-side a single case illustration, which supported feasibility and 
acceptability. This study details how digital technologies such as EMA/I may be 
used in future as clinical tools to enhance standard psychological treatments 
and clinical care of people with persisting and distressing experiences.

BACKGROUND: After experiencing symptoms for an average of 7 years before 
diagnosis, patients with endometriosis are usually left with more questions than 
answers about managing their symptoms in the absence of a cure. To help women 
with endometriosis after their diagnosis, we developed a digital program 
combining user research, evidence-based medicine, and clinical expertise. 
Structured around cognitive behavioral therapy and the quality of life metrics 
from the Endometriosis Health Profile score, the program was designed to guide 
participants for 3 months.
OBJECTIVE: This cohort study was designed to measure the impact of a digital 
health program on the symptoms and quality of life levels of women with 
endometriosis.
METHODS: In total, 63% (92/146) of the participants were included in the pilot 
study, recruited either free of charge through employer health insurance or via 
individual direct access. A control group of 404 women with endometriosis who 
did not follow the program, recruited through social media and mailing 
campaigns, was sampled (n=149, 36.9%) according to initial pain levels to ensure 
a similar pain profile to participants. Questionnaires assessing quality of life 
and symptom levels were emailed to both groups at baseline and 3 months. 
Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were used to analyze intragroup and 
intergroup differences, with Cohen d measuring effect sizes for significant 
results.
RESULTS: Over 3 months, participants showed substantial improvements in global 
symptom burden, general pain level, anxiety, depression, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, 
chronic fatigue, neuropathic pain, and endo belly. These improvements were 
significantly different from the control group for global symptom burden 
(participants: mean -0.7, SD 1.6; controls: mean -0.3, SD 1.3; P=.048; small 
effect size), anxiety (participants: mean -1.1, SD 2.8; controls: mean 0.2, SD 
2.5; P<.001; medium effect size), depression (participants: mean -0.9, SD 2.5; 
controls: mean 0.0, SD 3.1; P=.04; small effect size), neuropathic pain 
(participants: mean -1.0, SD 2.7; controls: mean -0.1, SD 2.6; P=.004; small 
effect size), and endo belly (participants: mean -0.9, SD 2.5; controls: mean 
-0.3, SD 2.4; P=.03; small effect size). Participants' quality of life improved 
between baseline and 3 months and significantly differed from that of the 
control group for the core part of the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 
(participants: mean -5.9, SD 21.0; controls: mean 1.0, SD 14.8; P=.03; small 
effect size) and the EQ-5D (participants: mean 0.1, SD 0.1; controls: mean -0.0, 
SD 0.1; P=.001; medium effect size). Perceived knowledge of endometriosis was 
significantly greater at 3 months among participants compared to the control 
group (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study's results suggest that a digital health program 
providing medical and scientific information about endometriosis and 
multidisciplinary self-management tools may be useful to reduce global symptom 
burden, anxiety, depression, neuropathic pain, and endo belly while improving 
knowledge on endometriosis and quality of life among participants.

This study aims to assess whether 12 sessions of indigenously adapted 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for excessive smartphone use (IACBT-ESU) would 
reduce excessive smartphone use. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was 
conducted in students (12 to 19 years of age) to examine the potential 
beneficial effects of IACBT-ESU (n = 62) compared with brief educational data 
alone (n = 62). Symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and peer relations were 
also compared between the two groups. The IACBT-ESU group demonstrated 
significant reductions in excessive smartphone use, with reduced symptoms of 
depression, anxiety, stress, hyperactivity, and emotional difficulties at both 
trial end and at 3-month follow-up (p < .01) compared with control participants. 
IACBT-ESU was associated with reduced excessive smartphone use and improved 
psychological well-being, with beneficial findings maintained 3 months after the 
trial's end. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

BACKGROUND: Depression is a major contributor to the burden of disease in the 
adolescent population. Internet-based interventions can increase access to 
treatment.
AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy 
(iCBT), including therapist chat communication, in treatment of adolescent 
depression.
METHOD: Seventy adolescents, 15-19 years of age and presenting with depressive 
symptoms, were randomised to iCBT or attention control. The primary outcome was 
the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).
RESULTS: Significant reductions in depressive symptoms were found, favouring 
iCBT over the control condition (F(1,67) = 6.18, P < 0.05). The between-group 
effect size was Cohen's d = 0.71 (95% CI 0.22-1.19). A significantly higher 
proportion of iCBT participants (42.4%) than controls (13.5%) showed a 50% 
decrease in BDI-II score post-treatment (P < 0.01). The improvement for the iCBT 
group was maintained at 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention appears to effectively reduce symptoms of 
depression in adolescents and may be helpful in overcoming barriers to care 
among young people.

Digital interventions can enhance access to healthcare in under-resourced 
settings. However, guided digital interventions may be costly for low- and 
middle-income countries, despite their effectiveness. In this randomised control 
trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of two digital interventions designed to 
address this issue: (1) a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Skills Training (CST) 
intervention that increased scalability by using remote online group 
administration; and (2) the SuperBetter gamified self-guided CBT skills training 
app, which uses other participants rather than paid staff as guides. The study 
was implemented among anxious and/or depressed South African undergraduates 
(n = 371) randomised with equal allocation to Remote Group CST, SuperBetter, or 
a MoodFlow mood monitoring control. Symptoms were assessed with the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). 
Intention-to-treat analysis found effect sizes at the high end of prior digital 
intervention trials, including significantly higher adjusted risk differences 
(ARD; primary outcome) in joint anxiety/depression remission at 3-months and 
6-months for Remote Group CST (ARD = 23.3-18.9%, p = 0.001-0.035) and 
SuperBetter (ARD = 12.7-22.2%, p = 0.047-0.006) than MoodFlow and mean combined 
PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores (secondary outcome) significantly lower for Remote Group CST 
and SuperBetter than MoodFlow. These results illustrate how innovative delivery 
methods can increase the scalability of standard one-on-one guided digital 
interventions. PREREGISTRATION INTERNATIONAL STANDARD RANDOMISED CONTROLLED

BACKGROUND: Depressive disorder and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 
prevalent in primary care (PC). Pharmacological treatment, despite controversy, 
is commonly chosen due to resource limitations and difficulties in accessing 
face-to-face interventions. Depression significantly impacts various aspects of 
a person's life, affecting adherence to medical prescriptions and glycemic 
control and leading to future complications and increased health care costs. To 
address these challenges, information and communication technologies (eg, 
eHealth) have been introduced, showing promise in improving treatment continuity 
and accessibility. However, while eHealth programs have demonstrated 
effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms, evidence regarding glycemic 
control remains inconclusive. This randomized controlled trial aimed to test the 
efficacy of a low-intensity psychological intervention via a web app for 
mild-moderate depressive symptoms in individuals with T2DM compared with 
treatment as usual (TAU) in PC.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
of a web-based psychological intervention to treat depressive symptomatology in 
people with T2DM compared with TAU in a PC setting.
METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 
patients with T2DM, depressive symptoms of moderate severity, and glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.47% in PC settings. Patients were randomized to TAU 
(n=27) or a web-based psychological treatment group (n=22). This web-based 
treatment consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, improvement of diabetes 
self-care behaviors, and mindfulness. Cost-effectiveness analysis for the 
improvement of depressive symptomatology was conducted based on reductions in 3, 
5, or 50 points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The efficacy of 
diabetes control was estimated based on a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c levels. 
Follow-up was performed at 3 and 6 months. The cost-utility analysis was 
performed based on quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: Efficacy analysis showed that the web-based treatment program was more 
effective in improving depressive symptoms than TAU but showed only a slight 
improvement in HbA1c. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 186.76 for a 
3-point reduction in PHQ-9 and 206.31 for reductions of 5 and 50 percentage 
points were obtained. In contrast, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
improving HbA1c levels amounted to €1510.90 (€1=US $1.18 in 2018) per 
participant. The incremental cost-utility ratio resulted in €4119.33 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention, using web-based modules incorporating cognitive 
behavioral therapy tools, diabetes self-care promotion, and mindfulness, 
effectively reduced depressive symptoms and enhanced glycemic control in 
patients with T2DM. Notably, it demonstrated clinical efficacy and economic 
efficiency. This supports the idea that eHealth interventions not only benefit 
patients clinically but also offer cost-effectiveness for health care systems. 
The study emphasizes the importance of including specific modules to enhance 
diabetes self-care behaviors in future web-based psychological interventions, 
emphasizing personalization and adaptation for this population.

BACKGROUND: The website mindline.sg is a stress management and coping website 
that can be accessed anonymously in Singapore for free. Although designed to 
serve individuals who are well or have mild depression and anxiety symptoms, 
mindline.sg may potentially be used by clinicians as an adjunct therapeutic aid 
for patients with clinically diagnosed mental disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the perceived usability, acceptability, 
and usefulness of mindline.sg among individuals with diagnosed mental disorders 
in a clinical setting.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 173 participants was conducted in the 
waiting room of a psychiatrist's office at the National University Hospital in 
Singapore. Participants waiting for an appointment were given 30 minutes and a 
simple set of instructions to use three features of mindline.sg. They 
subsequently answered a set of web-based survey questions via their smartphones, 
including a 16-item subset of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire 
(PSSUQ) for usability measurement and 5 questions designed to understand the 
perceived usefulness and acceptability of mindline.sg. Multiple linear 
regression is used to determine the associated demographic factors with overall 
PSSUQ score. A chi-square test is performed to investigate associations of 
psychiatric condition with users' responses on acceptability and perceived 
usefulness of mindline.sg. For this study, P<.05 is considered significant.
RESULTS: We observed that the overall (mean 2.86, SD 1.46), system usefulness 
(mean 2.74, SD 1.46), and information quality (mean 2.98, SD 1.33) subscores of 
the PSSUQ survey are within a 99% CI of a literature-derived norm, which all 
have the interpretation of having high perceived usability. However, interface 
quality (mean 2.98, SD 1.33) scored lower than the literature-derived norm, 
although it is still better than the neutral score of 4. We find participants 
with lower than a General Certificate of Education O-Level or N-Level education 
tend to give a lower usability score as compared to others (β=.49; P=.02). 
Participants who have not been hospitalized previously due to their condition 
are also more likely to give a lower PSSUQ score as compared to individuals who 
have been hospitalized (β=.18; P=.03). The platform mindline.sg is also deemed 
to be generally useful and acceptable with all the survey questions receiving 
more than a 60% positive response. We found no association between the type(s) 
of self-reported psychiatric disorder(s) and the perceived usefulness and 
acceptability of mindline.sg.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that mindline.sg is generally perceived as usable 
and acceptable by individuals with a diagnosed mental disorder in Singapore. The 
study suggests improving usability among individuals with lower education 
levels. Particularly promising is the finding that previously hospitalized 
individuals have significantly higher perceived usability and satisfaction of 
the website, suggesting potential impact could be found among a moderately to 
severely at-risk clinical population. The effectiveness of mindline.sg as an 
adjunct therapy for individuals with diagnosed mental disorders should therefore 
be explored in future studies.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the first-line 
therapy for chronic insomnia. Mobile app-based CBTi (MCBTi) can enhance the 
accessibility of CBTi treatment; however, few studies have evaluated the 
effectiveness of MCBTi using a multicenter, randomized controlled trial design.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy of Somzz, an MCBTi that provides 
real-time and tailored feedback to users, through comparison with an active 
comparator app.
METHODS: In our multicenter, single-blind randomized controlled trial study, 
participants were recruited from 3 university hospitals and randomized into a 
Somzz group and a sleep hygiene education (SHE) group at a 1:1 ratio. The 
intervention included 6 sessions for 6 weeks, with follow-up visits over a 
4-month period. The Somzz group received audiovisual sleep education, guidance 
on relaxation therapy, and real-time feedback on sleep behavior. The primary 
outcome was the Insomnia Severity Index score, and secondary outcomes included 
sleep diary measures and mental health self-reports. We analyzed the outcomes 
based on the intention-to-treat principle.
RESULTS: A total of 98 participants were randomized into the Somzz (n=49, 50%) 
and SHE (n=49, 50%) groups. Insomnia Severity Index scores for the Somzz group 
were significantly lower at the postintervention time point (9.0 vs 12.8; 
t95=3.85; F2,95=22.76; ηp2=0.13; P<.001) and at the 3-month follow-up visit 
(11.3 vs 14.7; t68=2.61; F2,68=5.85; ηp2=0.03; P=.01) compared to those of the 
SHE group. The Somzz group maintained their treatment effect at the 
postintervention time point and follow-ups, with a moderate to large effect size 
(Cohen d=-0.62 to -1.35; P<.01 in all cases). Furthermore, the Somzz group 
showed better sleep efficiency (t95=-3.32; F2,91=69.87; ηp2=0.41; P=.001), wake 
after sleep onset (t95=2.55; F2,91=51.81; ηp2=0.36; P=.01), satisfaction 
(t95=-2.05; F2,91=26.63; ηp2=0.20; P=.04) related to sleep, and mental health 
outcomes, including depression (t95=2.11; F2,94=29.64; ηp2=0.21; P=.04) and 
quality of life (t95=-3.13; F2,94=54.20; ηp2=0.33; P=.002), compared to the SHE 
group after the intervention. The attrition rate in the Somzz group was 12% 
(6/49).
CONCLUSIONS: Somzz outperformed SHE in improving insomnia, mental health, and 
quality of life. The MCBTi can be a highly accessible, time-efficient, and 
effective treatment option for chronic insomnia, with high compliance.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to 
examine the effects of smartphone-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in 
preventing the onset of major depressive episodes (MDE) among pregnant women.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The target study population will be pregnant women of 
16-20 weeks gestation who are currently users of 'Luna Luna Baby', the most 
widely used app for pregnant women in Japan. Those who meet the eligibility 
criteria will be randomly allocated to the 6-module internet CBT programme that 
was newly developed for pregnant women (n=2500), or to a treatment-as-usual 
control group (n=2500). Participants in the intervention groups will be required 
to complete the programme by 32 weeks gestation. The primary outcomes are the 
number of new onsets of MDE, measured by using WHO Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview 3.0 at 32 weeks gestation and 3 months post partum. 
Survival analysis will be conducted to test for the effectiveness of the 
intervention on the time to the onset of MDE.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study plan has been approved by the Research 
Ethics Review Board of the Graduate School of Medicine/Faculty of Medicine, the 
University of Tokyo (2019150NI). If the intervention programmes are found to 
produce a significant positive effect in this RCT, these programmes can be made 
available for all users of the app in the future.

INTRODUCTION: The management of perinatal depression (PND) is challenging in 
China. The Thinking Healthy Programme (THP), developed under the core theory of 
cognitive-behavioural therapy, is an evidence-based approach that is recommended 
as a psychosocial intervention for managing PND in low/middle-income countries. 
Sparse evidence has been generated, however, to assess the effectiveness of THP 
and guide its implementation in China.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation study is 
ongoing in four cities in Anhui Province, China. A comprehensive online 
platform, Mom's Good Mood (MGM), has been developed. Perinatal women are 
screened using the WeChat screening tool (ie, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale embedded as metrics) in clinics. Different intensities of the intervention 
are delivered through the mobile application for different degrees of 
depression, according to the stratified care model. The THP WHO treatment manual 
has been tailored to be the core component of intervention. Guided by the Reach, 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework, process 
evaluations will be conducted to identify the facilitators and barriers to 
implementation and to modify the implementation strategy; summative evaluations 
will be carried out to examine the effectiveness of MGM in the management of PND 
within the primary healthcare system in China.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and consent for this programme were 
obtained from Institutional Review Boards in China: Anhui Medical University, 
Hefei, People's Republic of China (20170358). Results will be submitted to 
relevant conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND: Chile faces a significant postpartum depression prevalence and 
treatment gap, necessitating accessible interventions. While 
cognitive-behavioral internet-based interventions have proven effective in 
high-income countries, this field is underdeveloped in Chile. Based on the 
country's widespread use of digital technology, a guided 8-week 
cognitive-behavioral web app intervention named "Mamá, te entiendo" was 
developed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of 
"Mamá, te entiendo", for reducing depressive symptomatology in postpartum women.
METHODS: Sixty-five postpartum women with minor or major depression were 
randomly assigned to either intervention or waitlist. Primary outcomes centered 
on study feasibility, intervention feasibility, and acceptability. 
Semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample enriched the understanding of 
participants' experiences. Secondary outcomes included mental health variables 
assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Chilean women displayed great interest in the intervention. 44.8 % of 
participants completed the intervention. Participants reported high satisfaction 
and engagement levels, with interviewees highlighting the value of the 
intervention's content, exercises, and therapist's feedback. However, 
preliminary efficacy analysis didn't reveal a significant interaction between 
group and time for outcome measures.
DISCUSSION: This research represents a pioneering effort in Chile to evaluate an 
internet-based intervention for postpartum depression symptoms. The demonstrated 
feasibility and acceptability highlight the potential of integrating 
technology-driven approaches into mental health interventions. However, the 
intervention did not demonstrate superiority, as both groups exhibited similar 
positive progress in several outcomes. Therefore, the following research phase 
should involve a larger and more diverse sample to assess the intervention's 
effectiveness, identify influencing factors, and determine the individuals who 
benefit the most.

Objectives: Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for the early stages of mood 
or psychotic spectrum disorders are difficult to find in public health settings, 
and the efficacy of these treatments is limited by inconsistent behavioral skill 
practice among youth between sessions. Treatments can be made more accessible 
and efficacious when delivered through a group format that makes use of mobile 
applications to remind users to practice skills. Method: We conducted a 9-week, 
randomized controlled trial of the unified protocol (UP) for cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via telehealth in a group format, comparing 
an app-enhanced version of the treatment (AppUP) to standard UP for adolescents 
with mood and psychotic spectrum conditions. The app was designed to help 
participants review session content, practice treatment skills, and log their 
psychiatric symptoms. Study assessors evaluated adolescents for psychiatric 
symptom severity and psychosocial functioning prior to treatment, at 
posttreatment, and 3 months posttreatment. Results: Sixty adolescents (Mage = 
15.0, SD = 1.3) initiated the trial (30 were randomly assigned to each 
condition) with 49 retained at posttreatment (9 weeks) and 48 retained at 3 
months posttreatment. Adolescents in AppUP showed greater improvements in 
psychosocial functioning over the 5-month study compared with those in standard 
UP. AppUP was also associated with greater reductions in depression severity 
among youth with more self-reported skill practice compared to those in standard 
UP. Conclusions: This study supports the benefits of transdiagnostic CBT for 
youth with mood and psychotic symptoms. An adjunctive app appears to improve 
psychosocial functioning and mood among these youth, especially among those who 
practice behavioral skills regularly. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA,

BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a neuropsychiatric sequela that 
causes serious adverse effects on the prognosis of stroke patients. Our 
developed iPad application is a very innovative approach designed to improve 
participants' depressive symptoms by presenting positive words stimuli in a 
video. Although this application has fewer side effects than existing 
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and is likely less 
burdensome for patients and caregivers, its efficacy for PSD has not been 
investigated. Here we present a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol 
to investigate the therapeutic potential of this application intervention for 
PSD patients.
METHODS: This study is designed as a 5-week, single-center, open-label, 
parallel-group, pilot RCT. Thirty-two patients with PSD will be randomly 
assigned to a combination of the iPad application and usual rehabilitation or 
usual rehabilitation alone (1:1 allocation ratio). The iPad application 
intervention lasts 3 min a day, and the usual rehabilitation lasts 3 h a day. 
The primary outcome is the change from baseline in The Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Depression Scale score at the end of the 5-week intervention.
DISCUSSION: This pilot RCT is the first study to investigate the potential of 
iPad application interventions to reduce depressive symptoms in PSD patients. 
This pilot RCT determines whether this is a viable and effective intervention 
and informs the design for a full-scale trial. If our hypothesis is correct, 
this trial can provide evidence to augment the standard practice of iPad 
application interventions to improve depressive symptoms in patients with PSD.

BACKGROUND: While the negative consequences of insomnia are well-documented, a 
strengths-based understanding of how sleep can increase health promotion is 
still emerging and much-needed. Correlational evidence has connected sleep and 
insomnia to resilience; however, this relationship has not yet been 
experimentally tested. This study examined resilience as a mediator of treatment 
outcomes in a randomized clinical trial with insomnia patients.
METHODS: Participants were randomized to either digital cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I; n = 358) or sleep education control (n = 300), and 
assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-year follow-up. A structural 
equation modeling framework was utilized to test resilience as a mediator of 
insomnia and depression. Risk for insomnia and depression was also tested in the 
model, operationalized as a latent factor with sleep reactivity, stress, and 
rumination as indicators (aligned with the 3-P model). Sensitivity analyses 
tested the impact of change in resilience on the insomnia relapse and incident 
depression at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: dCBT-I resulted in greater improvements in resilience compared to the 
sleep education control. Furthermore, improved resilience following dCBT-I 
lowered latent risk, which was further associated with reduced insomnia and 
depression at 1-year follow-up. Sensitivity analyses indicated that each point 
improvement in resilience following treatment reduced the odds of insomnia 
relapse and incident depression 1 year later by 76% and 65%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved resilience is likely a contributing mechanism to treatment 
gains following insomnia therapy, which may then reduce longer-term risk for 
insomnia relapse and depression.

There are growing concerns on stress among nurses in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) in South-East Asia. It is important to improve mental health 
among nurses in these countries. The objective of this study was to examine the 
efficacy of two types of newly developed smartphone-based stress management 
programs in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among hospital nurses in 
Vietnam. This study was a three-arm (including two intervention groups and one 
control group) randomized trial. Participants were recruited from nurses in a 
large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two types (free-choice and fixed 
sequential order) of smartphone-based stress management programs were developed. 
Participants were randomly allocated to Program A (a free-choice, multimodule 
stress management), Program B (a fixed-order, internet cognitive behavioral 
therapy, iCBT), or a control group (treatment as usual). The depressive and 
anxiety symptoms were measured by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales 
at baseline, 3-, and 7-month follow-up surveys. 951 participants were randomly 
allocated to each of the three groups. Program B showed a statistically 
significant effect on improving depressive symptoms at 3-month (p = 0.048), but 
not at 7-month (p = 0.92); Cohen's d was - 0.18 (95% CI - 0.34 to - 0.02) and 
0.03 (95% CI - 1.00 to 1.05), respectively. Program A failed to show a 
significant intervention effect on any of the outcomes at 3- or 7-month 
follow-up (p > 0.05). Despite the small effect size, the present fixed-order 
iCBT program seems effective in improving depression of hospital nurses in 
Vietnam. A public health impact of the intervention can be scalable, when 
considering its accessibility and minimal cost.Trial registration number: The 
study protocol is registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMINCTR; 
ID = UMIN000033139). Registered date of the protocol is 1st Jul. 2018.

Despite the burden of chronic pain in sickle cell disease (SCD), 
nonpharmacological approaches remain limited. This multisite, randomized trial 
compared digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a digital pain/SCD 
education program ("Education") for managing pain and related symptoms. 
Participants were recruited virtually from seven SCD centers and community 
organizations in the United States. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with SCD-related 
chronic pain and/or daily opioid use were assigned to receive either CBT or 
Education for 12 weeks. Both groups used an app with interactive chatbot lessons 
and received personalized health coach support. The primary outcome was the 
change in pain interference at six months, with secondary outcomes including 
pain intensity, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Of 453 
screened participants, 359 (79%) were randomized to CBT (n = 181) or Education 
(n = 178); 92% were Black African American, and 66.3% were female. At six 
months, 250 participants (70%) completed follow-up assessments, with 16 (4%) 
withdrawals. Engagement with the chatbot varied, with 76% connecting and 48% 
completing at least one lesson, but 80% of participants completed at least one 
health coach session. Both groups showed significant within-group improvements 
in pain interference (CBT: -2.13; Education: -2.66), but no significant 
difference was observed between them (mean difference, 0.54; P = .57). There 
were no between-group differences in pain intensity, depression, anxiety, or 
quality of life. High engagement with health coaching and variable engagement 
with digital components may explain the similar outcomes between interventions 
in this diverse, hard-to-reach population.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness characterized by 
recurrent episodes of depressed, elevated, and mixed mood states. The addition 
of psychotherapy to pharmacological management can decrease symptoms, lower 
relapse rates, and improve quality of life; however, access to psychotherapy is 
limited. Mental health technologies such as smartphone apps are being studied as 
a means to increase access to and enhance the effectiveness of adjunctive 
psychotherapies for bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder find 
this intervention format acceptable, but our understanding of how people utilize 
and integrate these tools into their behavior change and maintenance processes 
remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore how individuals with 
bipolar disorder perceive and utilize a smartphone intervention for health 
behavior change and maintenance.
METHODS: Individuals with bipolar disorder were recruited via flyers placed at 
university-affiliated and private outpatient mental health practices to 
participate in a pilot study of LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management 
intervention. At the end of the study, all participants completed in-depth 
qualitative exit interviews. The behavior change framework developed to organize 
the intervention design was used to deductively code behavioral targets and 
determinants involved in target engagement. Inductive coding was used to 
identify themes not captured by this framework.
RESULTS: In terms of behavioral targets, participants emphasized the importance 
of managing mood episode-related signs and symptoms. They also discussed the 
importance of maintaining regular routines, sleep duration, and medication 
adherence. Participants emphasized that receiving support from a coach as well 
as seeking and receiving assistance from family, friends, and providers were 
important for managing behavioral targets and staying well. In terms of 
determinants, participants stressed the important role of monitoring for their 
behavior change and maintenance efforts. Monitoring facilitated self-awareness 
and reflection, which was considered valuable for staying well. Some 
participants also felt that the intervention facilitated learning information 
necessary for managing bipolar disorder but others felt that the information 
provided was too basic.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to addressing acceptability, satisfaction, and 
engagement, a person-based design of mental health technologies can be used to 
understand how people experience the impact of these technologies on their 
behavior change and maintenance efforts. This understanding may then be used to 
guide ongoing intervention development. The participants' perceptions aligned 
with the intervention's primary behavioral targets and use of a monitoring tool 
as a core intervention feature. Participant feedback further indicates that 
developing additional content and tools to address building and engaging social 
support may be an important avenue for improving LiveWell. A comprehensive 
behavior change framework to understand participant perceptions of their 
behavior change and maintenance efforts may help facilitate ongoing intervention 
development.

IMPORTANCE: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to 
reduce depressive symptoms, but the underlying mechanisms are not well 
understood and warrant further examination.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CBT-I modifies negative bias in the perception 
of emotional facial expressions and whether such changes mediate improvement in 
depressive symptoms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial of digital CBT-I 
vs sleep hygiene education was conducted. Adults living in the UK who met 
diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
criteria (score ≥10) for depression were recruited online from the community and 
randomly assigned to either a 6-session digital CBT-I program or a sleep hygiene 
webpage. Participant recruitment took place between April 26, 2021, and January 
24, 2022, and outcomes were assessed at 5 and 10 weeks post randomization. Data 
analysis was performed from December 1, 2022, to March 1, 2023.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary outcomes were recognition accuracy 
(percentage) of happy and sad facial expressions at 10 weeks assessed with the 
facial expression recognition task. Secondary outcomes were self-reported 
measures of insomnia, depressive symptoms, affect, emotional regulation 
difficulties, worry, perseverative thinking, midpoint of sleep, social jet lag, 
and the categorization of and recognition memory for emotional words. 
Intention-to-treat analysis was used.
RESULTS: A total of 205 participants were randomly assigned to CBT-I (n = 101) 
or sleep hygiene education (n = 104). The sample had a mean (SD) age of 49.3 
(10.1) years and was predominately female (165 [80.8%]). Retention was 85.7% 
(n = 175). At 10 weeks, the estimated adjusted mean difference for recognition 
accuracy was 3.01 (97.5% CI, -1.67 to 7.69; P = .15; Cohen d = 0.24) for happy 
facial expressions and -0.54 (97.5% CI, -3.92 to 2.84; P = .72; Cohen d = -0.05) 
for sad facial expressions. At 10 weeks, CBT-I compared with control decreased 
insomnia severity (adjusted difference, -4.27; 95% CI, -5.67 to -2.87), 
depressive symptoms (adjusted difference, -3.91; 95% CI, -5.20 to -2.62), 
negative affect (adjusted difference, -2.75; 95% CI, -4.58 to -0.92), emotional 
regulation difficulties (adjusted difference, -5.96; 95% CI, -10.61 to -1.31), 
worry (adjusted difference, -8.07; 95% CI, -11.81 to -4.33), and perseverative 
thinking (adjusted difference, -4.21; 95% CI, -7.03 to -1.39) and increased 
positive affect (adjusted difference, 4.99; 95% CI, 3.13-6.85). Improvement in 
negative affect, emotional regulation difficulties, and worry at week 5 mediated 
the effect of CBT-I on depression severity at 10 weeks (% mediated: 21.9% 
Emotion regulation difficulties; 24.4% Worry; and 29.7% Negative affect). No 
serious adverse events were reported to the trial team.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial did not find evidence 
that CBT-I engenders change in the perception of facial expressions at post 
treatment, despite improvements in insomnia and depressive symptoms. Early 
change in negative affect, emotional regulation difficulties, and worry mediated 
lagged depression outcomes and deserve further empirical scrutiny.

BACKGROUND: About 70% of all mental health disorders appear before the age of 25 
years. When untreated, these disorders can become long-standing and impair 
multiple life domains. When compared with all Canadian youth (of different 
ages), individuals aged between 15 and 25 years are significantly more likely to 
experience mental health disorders, substance dependencies, and risks for 
suicidal ideation and death by suicide. Progress in the treatment of youth, 
capitalizing on their online responsivity, can strategically address depressive 
disorders.
OBJECTIVE: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare online 
mindfulness-oriented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-M) combined with standard 
psychiatric care versus psychiatric care alone in youth diagnosed with major 
depressive disorder. We will enroll 168 subjects in the age range of 18 to 30 
years; 50% of subjects will be from First Nations (FN) backgrounds, whereas the 
other 50% will be from all other ethnic backgrounds. There will be equal 
stratification into 2 intervention groups (INT1 and INT2) and 2 wait-list 
control groups (CTL1 and CTL2) with 42 subjects per group, resulting in an equal 
number of INT1 and CTL1 of FN background and INT2 and CTL2 of non-FN background.
METHODS: The inclusion criteria are: (1) age 18 to 30 years, FN background or 
other ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II of at least mild 
severity (BDI-II score ≥14) and no upper limit; (3) Mini-International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-confirmed psychiatric diagnosis of major 
depressive disorder; and (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed by a 
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health psychiatrist, with diagnoses confirmed 
using the MINI interview. The exclusion criteria are: (1) individuals receiving 
weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) individuals who meet the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for severe alcohol/substance use 
disorder in the past 3 months, or who demonstrate clinically significant 
suicidal ideation defined as imminent intent, or who have attempted suicide in 
the past 6 months; and (3) individuals with comorbid diagnoses of borderline 
personality, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and/or obsessive compulsive 
disorder. All subjects are provided standard psychiatric care defined as 1 
monthly session that focuses on appropriate medication, with session durations 
of 15 to 30 min. Experimental subjects receive an additional intervention 
consisting of the CBT-M online software program (in collaboration with Nex J 
Health, Inc). Exposure to and interaction with the online workbooks are combined 
with navigation-coaching delivered by phone and secure text message 
interactions.
RESULTS: The outcomes selected, combined with measurement blinding, are key 
features in assessing whether significant benefits regarding depression and 
anxiety symptoms occur.
CONCLUSIONS: If results confirm the hypothesis that youth can be effectively 
treated with online CBT-M, effective services may be widely delivered with less 
geographic restriction.

BACKGROUND: Mental health apps tend to be narrow in their functioning, with 
their focus mostly being on tracking, management, or psychoeducation. It is 
unclear what capability such apps have to facilitate a change in users, 
particularly in terms of learning key constructs relating to behavioral 
interventions. Thought Challenger (CBITs, Chicago) is a skill-building app that 
engages users in cognitive restructuring, a core component of cognitive therapy 
(CT) for depression.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the learnability and 
learning performance of users following initial use of Thought Challenger.
METHODS: Twenty adults completed in-lab usability testing of Thought Challenger, 
which comprised two interactions with the app. Learnability was measured via 
completion times, error rates, and psychologist ratings of user entries in the 
app; learning performance was measured via a test of CT knowledge and skills. 
Nonparametric tests were conducted to evaluate the difference between 
individuals with no or mild depression to those with moderate to severe 
depression, as well as differences in completion times and pre- and posttests.
RESULTS: Across the two interactions, the majority of completion times were 
found to be acceptable (5 min or less), with minimal errors (1.2%, 10/840) and 
successful completion of CT thought records. Furthermore, CT knowledge and 
skills significantly improved after the initial use of Thought Challenger 
(P=.009).
CONCLUSIONS: The learning objectives for Thought Challenger during initial uses 
were successfully met in an evaluation with likely end users. The findings 
therefore suggest that apps are capable of providing users with opportunities 
for learning of intervention skills.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer survivors are more likely to report psychological 
distress and unmet need for support compared to healthy controls. Psychological 
mobile health interventions might be used in follow-up care of breast cancer 
patients to improve their mental health.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Cochrane and PROSPERO for articles on 
controlled trials examining the effectiveness of psychological mobile health 
interventions compared to routine care regarding mental health outcomes of adult 
breast cancer survivors. This review followed the PRISMA statement and was 
registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022312972). Two researchers independently reviewed 
publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.
RESULTS: After screening 204 abstracts published from 2005 to February 2023, 
eleven randomised trials involving 2249 patients with a mean age between 43.9 
and 56.2 years met the inclusion criteria. All interventions used components of 
cognitive behavioural therapy. Most studies applied self-guided interventions. 
Five studies reported percentages of patients never started (range = 3-15%) or 
discontinued the intervention earlier (range = 3-36%). No long-term 
effect > 3 months post intervention was reported. Three of seven studies 
reported a significant short-term intervention effect for distress. Only one 
study each showed an effect for depression (1/5), anxiety (1/5), fear of 
recurrence (1/4) and self-efficacy (1/3) compared to a control group.
CONCLUSIONS: A wide variance of interventions was used. Future studies should 
follow guidelines in developing and reporting their mobile interventions and 
conduct long-term follow-up to achieve reliable and comparable results.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: No clear effect of psychological mobile 
health interventions on patients' mental health could be shown.

BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs), including computer-assisted 
therapy, smartphone apps and wearable technologies, are heralded as having 
enormous potential to improve uptake and accessibility, efficiency, clinical 
effectiveness and personalisation of mental health interventions. It is 
generally assumed that DHIs will be preferred by children and young people (CYP) 
given their ubiquitous digital activity. However, it remains uncertain whether: 
DHIs for CYP are clinically and cost-effective, CYP prefer DHIs to traditional 
services, DHIs widen access and how they should be evaluated and adopted by 
mental health services. This review evaluates the evidence-base for DHIs and 
considers the key research questions and approaches to evaluation and 
implementation.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-review of scoping, narrative, systematic or 
meta-analytical reviews investigating the effectiveness of DHIs for mental 
health problems in CYP. We also updated a systematic review of randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) of DHIs for CYP published in the last 3 years.
RESULTS: Twenty-one reviews were included in the meta-review. The findings 
provide some support for the clinical benefit of DHIs, particularly computerised 
cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT), for depression and anxiety in adolescents 
and young adults. The systematic review identified 30 new RCTs evaluating DHIs 
for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, anxiety, 
depression, psychosis, eating disorders and PTSD. The benefits of DHIs in 
managing ADHD, autism, psychosis and eating disorders are uncertain, and 
evidence is lacking regarding the cost-effectiveness of DHIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Key methodological limitations make it difficult to draw definitive 
conclusions from existing clinical trials of DHIs. Issues include variable 
uptake and engagement with DHIs, lack of an agreed typology/taxonomy for DHIs, 
small sample sizes, lack of blinded outcome assessment, combining different 
comparators, short-term follow-up and poor specification of the level of human 
support. Research and practice recommendations are presented that address the 
key research questions and methodological issues for the evaluation and clinical 
implementation of DHIs for CYP.

BACKGROUND: Increasing interest has centered on the psychotherapeutic working 
alliance as a means of understanding clinical change in digital mental health 
interventions in recent years. However, little is understood about how and to 
what extent a digital mental health program can have an impact on the working 
alliance and clinical outcomes in a blended (therapist plus digital program) 
cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) intervention for depression.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the difference in working alliance scores 
between bCBT and treatment as usual (TAU), examine the association between 
working alliance and depression severity scores in both arms, and test for an 
interaction between system usability and working alliance with regard to the 
association between working alliance and depression scores in bCBT at 3-month 
assessments.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of the E-COMPARED (European 
Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment versus 
Treatment-as-usual) trial, which compared bCBT with TAU across 9 European 
countries. Data were collected in primary care and specialized services between 
April 2015 and December 2017. Eligible participants aged 18 years or older and 
diagnosed with major depressive disorder were randomized to either bCBT (n=476) 
or TAU (n=467). bCBT consisted of 6-20 sessions of bCBT (involving face-to-face 
sessions with a therapist and an internet-based program). TAU consisted of usual 
care for depression. The main outcomes were scores of the working alliance 
(Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised-Client [WAI-SR-C]) and depressive 
symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3 months after 
randomization. Other variables included system usability scores (System 
Usability Scale-Client [SUS-C]) at 3 months and baseline demographic 
information. Data from baseline and 3-month assessments were analyzed using 
linear regression models that adjusted for a set of baseline variables.
RESULTS: Of the 945 included participants, 644 (68.2%) were female, and the mean 
age was 38.96 years (IQR 38). bCBT was associated with higher composite WAI-SR-C 
scores compared to TAU (B=5.67, 95% CI 4.48-6.86). There was an inverse 
association between WAI-SR-C and PHQ-9 in bCBT (B=-0.12, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06) 
and TAU (B=-0.06, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.02), in which as WAI-SR-C scores increased, 
PHQ-9 scores decreased. Finally, there was a significant interaction between 
SUS-C and WAI-SR-C with regard to an inverse association between higher WAI-SR-C 
scores and lower PHQ-9 scores in bCBT (b=-0.030, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01; P=.005).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that bCBT may 
enhance the client working alliance when compared to evidence-based routine care 
for depression that services reported offering. The working alliance in bCBT was 
also associated with clinical improvements that appear to be enhanced by good 
program usability. Our findings add further weight to the view that the addition 
of internet-delivered CBT to face-to-face CBT may positively augment experiences 
of the working alliance.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We reviewed research on computer-assisted cognitive-behavior 
therapy (CCBT) and mobile applications with the goals of assessing the 
effectiveness of these newer methods of delivering or augmenting treatment and 
making recommendations on the clinical use of computer tools in psychotherapy of 
depression and anxiety.
RECENT FINDINGS: Research on CCBT has found solid evidence for efficacy when the 
use of a therapeutic computer program is supported by a clinician or other 
helping professionals. Lower levels of efficacy or ineffectiveness typically 
have been found when computer programs are used as stand-alone treatments. A 
large number of mobile apps have been created that claim to be useful for 
depression and/or anxiety. However, considerable caution is warranted in 
evaluating mobile apps and recommending them to patients. Research on mobile 
apps is still in an early stage of development. A number of well-established 
CCBT programs have been studied in multiple randomized, controlled trials and 
have been found to be effective. Such programs appear to have adequate quality, 
security, and efficacy to be used in clinical practice. Mobile apps offer easy 
portability and immediate access to coping strategies and may be useful for 
augmenting treatment. But clinicians need to select apps with integrity and 
reliable content for clinical use.

Previous studies reported that digital psychotherapy was a clinically beneficial 
intervention for suicide ideation. However, the effects of digital psychotherapy 
on other aspects of suicide beyond ideation remain unclear. Therefore, this 
study investigated the effects of digital psychotherapy on suicide and 
depression. Articles were identified by searching Cochrane, Google Scholar, 
Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO in line with the PRISMA statement, 
yielding nine randomized controlled trials. The difference between conditions 
regarding suicide and depression in the effect size of the individual article 
was calculated using Hedges' g. Most digital psychotherapy interventions were 
based on cognitive behavioral therapy and delivered via apps or the web for at 
least six weeks. Suicide outcomes primarily focused on suicide ideation. The 
findings showed digital psychotherapy achieved a significantly larger effect 
size for suicide (g = 0.488, p < 0.001) and depression (g = 0.316, p < 0.001), 
compared to controls. Specifically, digital psychotherapy showed a significant 
effect on both suicide ideation (g = 0.478, p < 0.001) and other suicidal 
variables (g = 0.330, p < 0.001). These results suggest the effectiveness of 
digital psychotherapy in reducing suicide and depression compared to traditional 
face-to-face therapy. Future research should consider a wider range of outcomes 
and examine the long-term effectiveness of digital psychotherapy to better 
understand its effects on suicide prevention.

OBJECTIVE: This article describes trends and attributes associated with digital 
mental health application (DMHA) referrals from December 2019 through December 
2021.
METHODS: In total, 43,842 DMHA referrals for 25,213 unique patients were 
extracted from the electronic health record of a large, diverse, integrated 
health system. DMHAs were aggregated by type (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] 
or mindfulness and meditation [MM]). Monthly referral patterns were described 
and categorized into mutually exclusive clusters (MM, CBT, or MM and CBT). 
Multinomial logistic regression and post hoc predicted probabilities were used 
to profile patient, clinical, and encounter attributes among referral clusters.
RESULTS: DMHA referrals increased, reached equilibrium, and then began to 
decline over the 25-month observation period. Compared with the referral cluster 
average, MM-alone referrals were more likely to occur for patients who were ages 
≥65, who were Hispanic or Asian, whose reason for visit concerned mental health, 
and who had a primary diagnosis of other anxiety disorders. CBT-alone referrals 
were more likely to occur for patients with a primary diagnosis of depression 
and less likely to occur for Hispanic patients. Combined MM and CBT referrals 
were more likely to occur for patients who were ages 18-30, whose reason for 
visit was "other," and who had a primary diagnosis of depression and were less 
likely to occur for Hispanic patients and those ages ≥65.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this study demonstrates readiness to integrate DMHA 
referral into clinical workflows, observed variations in attributes of referral 
clusters support the need to further investigate provider decision making and 
whether referral patterns are optimal and sustainable.

Social and Mental Health Impact of Nuclear Disaster in Survivors: A Narrative 
Review.

Author information:

This narrative review synthesizes the literature on the psychological 
consequences of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident of 1979, the Chernobyl 
nuclear disaster of 1986, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. A search 
was conducted on OVID for studies in English from 1966 to 2020. Fifty-nine 
studies were included. Living through a nuclear disaster is associated with 
higher levels of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Decontamination workers, those 
living in closest proximity to the reactor, and evacuees experience higher rates 
of mental health problems after a nuclear disaster. Those with greater 
psychological resilience and social supports experience lower rates of 
psychological distress. Individual-level interventions, such as mindfulness 
training, behavioral activation, and cognitive reappraisal training, have shown 
modest benefits on improving psychological wellbeing. At the population level, 
many of the measures in place aimed at reducing exposure to radiation actually 
increase individuals' anxiety. Technology-based supports have been studied in 
other types of natural disasters and it may be beneficial to look at 
mobile-based interventions for future nuclear disasters.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions are seen as an important potential 
strategy to improve accessibility and affordability of high quality treatments 
in mental healthcare. A growing number of studies have demonstrated the clinical 
efficacy of internet-based treatment for mood disorders, but scientific evidence 
for the application in routine specialised mental healthcare settings is 
limited. Also, little is known about the clinical and health-economic benefits 
of blended treatment, where online interventions are integrated with 
face-to-face treatment of depression in one treatment protocol. The primary aim 
of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended 
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (bCBT) for depression, as compared to treatment as 
usual (TAU) in specialised routine mental healthcare in the Netherlands. This 
trial is part of the E-COMPARED project which has a broader perspective, 
focussing on primary and specialised care in eight European countries.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial with 
two parallel conditions: bCBT and TAU. The blended treatment combines individual 
face-to-face CBT with CBT delivered through an Internet-based treatment platform 
(Moodbuster). This platform includes a mobile phone application, used for 
ecological momentary assessments, automated feedback and motivational messages. 
Weekly alternating face-to-face (10) and online (9) sessions will be delivered 
over a period of 19-20 weeks. TAU is defined as the routine care that subjects 
receive when they are diagnosed with depression in specialised mental 
healthcare. Adult patients ≥ 18 years old meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for 
major depressive disorder will be recruited within participating outpatient 
specialised mental healthcare clinics in the Netherlands. Measurements will be 
taken at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome will 
be depressive symptoms, measured with the PHQ-9 and QIDS. Secondary outcomes 
include health-related quality of life, mastery, treatment preference, working 
alliance, system usability, treatment satisfaction and possible negative 
side-effects. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a 
societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect healthcare costs.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the health and 
economical outcomes of blended treatment for depression and give an indication 
of the value of implementing blended treatment in specialised clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is associated with significant health 
consequences for the parent and child. Current recommendations for PPD 
prevention require intense health care system resources. Evidence-based 
interventions for PPD prevention that do not further burden the health care 
system are needed. Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) can generally 
reduce depressive symptoms. Technology-based interventions may help decrease 
common barriers to PA.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report the protocol and provide a data overview of 
the POstpartum Wellness study (POW)-an effectiveness trial evaluating whether an 
eHealth PA intervention tailored for postpartum individuals increased PA and 
decreased depressive symptoms among individuals at high PPD risk.
METHODS: This remote parallel-group randomized controlled trial included 
postpartum individuals with a history of depression or at least moderate current 
depressive symptoms not meeting the PPD diagnostic threshold and with low PA 
levels from an integrated health care delivery system. Participants were 
randomized to an eHealth PA intervention or usual care. The intervention group 
received access to a library of web-based workout videos designed for postpartum 
individuals, which included interaction with their infants. At baseline and 
follow-up (3 and 6 months), PA was measured using questionnaires and a 
wrist-worn accelerometer. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). Data were collected to assess exploratory 
outcomes of sleep, perceived stress, anxiety, parent-infant bonding, and infant 
development.
RESULTS: The study was funded in January 2020. Participants were enrolled via 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) or telephonically between November 
2020 and September 2022; data collection ended in April 2023. Randomized 
participants (N=99) were 4 months post partum at baseline with moderately severe 
depressive symptoms (mean PHQ-8 score 12.6, SD 2.2). Intervention (n=50) and 
usual care (n=49) groups had similar sociodemographic characteristics, months 
post partum, baseline depressive symptoms, number of children at home, and 
prepregnancy PA levels. Retention in assessments was ≥66% for questionnaires and 
≥48% for accelerometry, with modest differences by group. At 3-month follow-up, 
73 of 99 (74%) participants (intervention: 35/50, 70%; usual care: 38/49, 78%) 
completed questionnaires; 53 of 99 (54%) wore the accelerometer for 7 days (27 
of 50 (54%) intervention, 26 of 49 (53%) usual care). At 6-month follow-up, 66 
of 99 (67%) participants (30 of 50 (60%) intervention, 36 of 49 (73%) usual 
care) completed questionnaires and 43 of 99 (43%) wore the accelerometer for 7 
days (21 of 50 (42%) intervention, 22 of 49 (45%) usual care). Data analysis is 
completed, and a manuscript with these findings is currently under review for 
publication.
CONCLUSIONS: The POW trial evaluates the effectiveness of an eHealth PA 
intervention for improving depressive symptoms and increasing PA among 
postpartum individuals at high PPD risk. Results have implications for the 
design and delivery of behavioral interventions among vulnerable patients.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of the substantial burden of mental 
health disorders at an individual and population level, including consequent 
demand on mental health services. Lifestyle-based mental healthcare offers an 
additional approach to existing services with potential to help alleviate system 
burden. Despite the latest Royal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 
guidelines recommending that lifestyle is a 'first-line', 'non-negotiable' 
treatment for mood disorders, few such programs exist within clinical practice. 
Additionally, there are limited data to determine whether lifestyle approaches 
are equivalent to established treatments. Using an individually randomised group 
treatment design, we aim to address this gap by evaluating an integrated 
lifestyle program (CALM) compared to an established therapy (psychotherapy), 
both delivered via telehealth. It is hypothesised that the CALM program will not 
be inferior to psychotherapy with respect to depressive symptoms at 8 weeks.
METHODS: The study is being conducted in partnership with Barwon Health's Mental 
Health, Drugs & Alcohol Service (Geelong, Victoria), from which 184 participants 
from its service and surrounding regions are being recruited. Eligible 
participants with elevated psychological distress are being randomised to CALM 
or psychotherapy. Each takes a trans-diagnostic approach, and comprises four 
weekly (weeks 1-4) and two fortnightly (weeks 6 and 8) 90-min, group-based 
sessions delivered via Zoom (digital video conferencing platform). CALM focuses 
on enhancing knowledge, behavioural skills and support for improving dietary and 
physical activity behaviours, delivered by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist 
and Accredited Practising Dietitian. Psychotherapy uses cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) delivered by a Psychologist or Clinical Psychologist, and 
Provisional Psychologist. Data collection occurs at baseline and 8 weeks. The 
primary outcome is depressive symptoms (assessed via the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9) at 8 weeks. Societal and healthcare costs will be estimated to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of the CALM program. A process evaluation will 
determine its reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance.
DISCUSSION: If the CALM program is non-inferior to psychotherapy, this study 
will provide the first evidence to support lifestyle-based mental healthcare as 
an additional care model to support individuals experiencing psychological 
distress.

BACKGROUND: Despite the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavior therapy for 
insomnia (dCBT-I) in treating comorbid insomnia and depression, its 
accessibility and high dropout rates among adolescents and young adults remain 
significant limitations. A potential solution could be nurse-led dCBT-I. This 
study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of nurse-led dCBT-I in reducing 
insomnia symptoms and improving mood in adolescents and young adults with 
depression.
AIMS: Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a 
nurse-led dCBT-I in reducing insomnia severity among adolescents and young 
adults with depression.
METHODS: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial involved 40 adolescents 
and young adults aged 14 to 24 with major depressive disorder and insomnia. They 
were assigned to receive either a nurse-led 6-week dCBT-I or usual care. The 
study evaluated outcomes such as insomnia severity, depression severity, and 
sleep parameters. Measurements were taken at baseline, immediately after the 
intervention (6 weeks), and during a follow-up at 18 weeks.
RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a generalized 
linear mixed model (GLMM). Results indicated that, compared to the control 
group, participants in the intervention group exhibited a significant reduction 
in insomnia severity at the 18-week follow-up, with a large effect size (Cohen's 
d = -0.965, p < 0.001). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated a 
significant decrease in depression severity both at the end of the intervention 
(Cohen's d = -0.686, p = 0.001) and at the 18-week follow-up (Cohen's 
d = -0.508, p = 0.011), indicating a medium effect size.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led dCBT-I is an effective treatment for adolescents and 
young adults with depression and insomnia.

BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is as effective a technique as traditional 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a promising tool for treating panic 
disorder symptoms because VR exposure can be safer and has better acceptability 
than in vivo exposure and is more immersive than exposure through imagination. 
CBT techniques can be delivered more effectively using VR as well. So far, VR 
has required high-quality devices, but the development of mobile VR technology 
has improved user availability. At the same time, a well-structured form of VR 
can be reproduced and used anywhere. This means that VR can be used to provide a 
self-guided form of treatment and address the high treatment costs of 
evidence-based therapy and the lack of professional therapists. This study aimed 
to investigate the potential of self-guided VR as an alternative to high-cost 
treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study was to offer data about the efficacy of a 
mobile app-based self-led VR CBT in the treatment of panic disorder.
METHODS: A total of 54 subjects with panic disorder were enrolled in this study 
and randomly assigned to either the VR treatment group or waitlist group. The VR 
treatment was designed to be total 12 sessions for 4 weeks. The VR treatment 
consists of 4 steps in which patients are gradually exposed to phobic stimuli 
while learning to cope with panic symptoms in each stage. The effectiveness of 
treatment was assessed through the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Hamilton 
Rating Scale for Depression, Body Sensations Questionnaire, Albany Panic and 
Phobia Questionnaire, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Korean Inventory of Social Avoidance and 
Distress Scale, Korean Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and Perceived 
Stress Scale. In addition, physiological changes using heart rate variability 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: In within-group analyses, the VR treatment group exhibited improvements 
in panic disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression after 4 weeks, while the 
waitlist group did not show any significant improvement. Compared to the 
waitlist group, the VR treatment group showed significantly greater improvements 
in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale in both completer analysis and 
intention-to-treat analysis. Heart rate variability in the VR treatment group 
showed improvement in normalized high frequency from baseline to postassessment 
with no significant differences in any outcome measure between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The self-guided, mobile app-based VR intervention was effective in 
the treatment of panic symptoms and restoring the autonomic nervous system 
demonstrating the validity of the use of VR for self-guided treatment. VR 
treatment can be a cost-effective therapeutic approach.

This pilot feasibility study investigated a brief, tailored mobile health 
intervention to provide brief treatment and motivate further depression 
treatment seeking among patients with comorbid chronic pain. The computer tablet 
intervention was delivered in a hospital clinic using a blended motivational 
interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy approach. Individuals were at 
least age 18, and screened positive for depression during a visit for chronic 
pain. Participants completed assessments before the intervention and at two-week 
follow-up. The 64 participants were most often over 50 years old, female, and 
Caucasian. Participant ratings demonstrated an increase in interest to seek 
depression treatment and willingness to make life changes to mitigate symptoms. 
A significant reduction in mean depression score and non-significant reductions 
on both measures of disability were observed. This intervention was feasible and 
acceptable, demonstrated promise in reducing depression and increasing treatment 
interest, and should be tested in a trial.

BACKGROUND: As an established treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is now implemented and assessed in 
internet-based formats that, when combined with smartphone apps, enable secure 
text messaging. As an adjunct to such internet-based CBT (ICBT) approaches, text 
messaging has been associated with increased adherence and therapeutic alliance.
OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed data from the intervention arm of a randomized 
control trial evaluating 24-week ICBT for MDD (intervention arm) against 
standard-care psychiatry (waitlist control). The aim of this secondary analysis 
was to assess MDD symptom improvement in relation to the frequency and content 
of text messages sent by ICBT participants to Navigator-Coaches during 
randomized control trial participation. Higher text frequency in general and in 
3 conceptual categories (appreciating alliance, alliance building disclosures, 
and agreement confirmation) was hypothesized to predict larger MDD symptom 
improvement.
METHODS: Participants were young adults (18-30 years) from the Centre for 
Addiction and Mental Health. The frequencies of categorized texts from 20 ICBT 
completers were analyzed with respect to MDD symptom improvement using linear 
regression models. Texts were coded by 2 independent coders and categorized 
using content analysis. MDD symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression 
Inventory-II (BDI-II).
RESULTS: Participants sent an average of 136 text messages. Analyses indicated 
that BDI-II improvement was negatively associated with text messaging frequency 
in general (β=-0.029, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.048) and in each of the 3 categories: 
appreciating alliance (β=-0.096, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.61), alliance building 
disclosures (β=-0.098, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.084), and agreement confirmation 
(β=-0.076, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.25). Altogether, the effect of text messaging on 
BDI-II improvement was uniformly negative across statistical models. More text 
messaging appeared associated with less MDD symptom improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesized positive associations between conceptually 
categorized text messages and MDD symptom improvement were not supported in this 
study. Instead, more text messaging appeared to indicate less treatment benefit. 
Future studies with larger samples are needed to discern the optimal use of text 
messaging in ICBT approaches using adjunctive modes of communication.

BACKGROUND: A considerable portion of daily thought is spent in mind wandering. 
This behavior has been related to positive (eg, future planning, problem 
solving) and negative (eg, unhappiness, impaired cognitive performance) 
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: Based on previous research suggesting future-oriented (ie, 
prospective) mind wandering may support autobiographical planning and 
self-regulation, this study examined associations between hourly mind wandering 
and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and the impact of affect and 
daily sleep on these relations.
METHODS: College-aged adults (N=33) participated in a mobile phone-delivered 
ecological momentary assessment study for 1 week. Sixteen hourly prompts 
assessing mind wandering and affect were delivered daily via participants' 
mobile phones. Perceived sleep quality and duration was assessed during the 
first prompt each day, and participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer during 
waking hours throughout the study week.
RESULTS: Study findings suggest present-moment mind wandering was positively 
associated with future MVPA (P=.03), and this relationship was moderated by 
affective state (P=.04). Moreover, excessive sleep the previous evening was 
related to less MVPA across the following day (P=.007). Further, mind wandering 
was positively related to activity only among those who did not oversleep 
(P=.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results have implications for multiple health 
behavior interventions targeting physical activity, affect, and sleep. 
Researchers may also build on this work by studying these relationships in the 
context of other important behaviors and psychosocial factors (eg, tobacco use, 
depression, loneliness).

BACKGROUND: Suicide is a global public health problem. Digital interventions are 
considered a low-threshold treatment option for people with suicidal ideation or 
behaviors. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) targeting suicidal 
ideation has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation. However, 
suicidal ideation often is related to additional mental health problems, which 
should be addressed for optimal care. Yet, the effects of iCBT on related 
symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze whether digital interventions targeting suicidal 
ideation had an effect on related mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, 
and hopelessness).
METHODS: We systematically searched CENTRAL, PsycInfo, Embase, and PubMed for 
randomized controlled trials that investigated guided or unguided iCBT for 
suicidal ideation or behaviors. Participants reporting baseline suicidal 
ideation were eligible. Individual participant data (IPD) were collected from 
eligible trials. We conducted a 1-stage IPD meta-analysis on the effects on 
depression, anxiety, and hopelessness-analyzed as 2 indices: symptom severity 
and treatment response.
RESULTS: We included IPD from 8 out of 9 eligible trials comprising 1980 
participants with suicidal ideation. iCBT was associated with significant 
reductions in depression severity (b=-0.17; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09; P<.001) and 
higher treatment response (ie, 50% reduction of depressive symptoms; b=0.36; 95% 
CI 0.12-0.60; P=.008) after treatment. We did not find significant effects on 
anxiety and hopelessness.
CONCLUSIONS: iCBT for people with suicidal ideation revealed significant effects 
on depression outcomes but only minor or no effects on anxiety and hopelessness. 
Therefore, individuals with comorbid symptoms of anxiety or hopelessness may 
require additional treatment components to optimize care. Studies that monitor 
symptoms with higher temporal resolution and consider a broader spectrum of 
factors influencing suicidal ideation are needed to understand the complex 
interaction of suicidality and related mental health symptoms.

Background: There is a great need for feasible interventions in the initial 
period after a trauma that minimize the risk of developing a clinically relevant 
PTSD. The majority of people suffer from severe sleep disorders after a 
traumatic event. Because sleep is essential for processing emotional memories, 
we aim to improve sleep quality in acutely traumatized patients to benefit 
adaptive trauma processing and thereby prevent PTSD development.Objective: In a 
multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will investigate whether 
digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) has the potential to 
not only increase sleep quality in acutely traumatized individuals but also 
reduce trauma-related symptoms (specific PTSD symptoms as well as related 
symptoms such as depression, anxiety and functional outcomes) and the risk for 
PTSD development in acutely traumatized individuals. Moreover, we will test if 
sleep disturbances pre-therapy predict the development of later PTSD 
symptoms.Method: We aim to recruit 104 patients who will be randomly assigned to 
an app-based sleep intervention utilizing CBT-I or a sleep diary as an add-on to 
treatment-as-usual (TAU) in outpatient acute trauma centres. Sleep quality, PTSD 
symptoms and everyday functioning will be measured before, after the 
intervention and at a 6-month follow-up.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this 
multicentre RCT is the first study to use dCBT-I as an early intervention for 
trauma. It may improve the understanding of the role of sleep in the development 
of PTSD and has the potential to contribute to the development of an easy-to-use 
early intervention for acutely traumatized individuals.

Plain Language Summary: Sleep disturbances are common after traumatic events and 
could contribute to the processing of the traumatic event being disturbed.This 
study will increase our understanding of the role of sleep in PTSD 
development.The investigated approach has the potential to open up new 
possibilities for PTSD prevention.

Antecedentes: Existe una gran necesidad de intervenciones factibles en el 
periodo inicial después de un trauma que minimicen el riesgo de desarrollar un 
TEPT clínicamente relevante. La mayoría de las personas sufren de trastornos del 
sueño graves después de un evento traumático. Debido a que dormir es esencial 
para el procesamiento de los recuerdos emocionales, buscamos mejorar la calidad 
del sueño en pacientes con trauma agudo para beneficiar el procesamiento del 
trauma en forma adaptativa y así prevenir el desarrollo del TEPT. Objetivo: En 
un ensayo controlado aleatorizado multicéntrico (RCT por sus siglas en inglés) 
investigaremos si la terapia cognitivo conductual digital para el insomnio 
(dCBT-I por sus siglas en inglés) tiene el potencial de no solo mejorar la 
calidad del sueño en personas con trauma agudo si no también reducir los 
síntomas relacionados con el trauma (síntomas específicos de TEPT así como 
también síntomas relacionados tales como depresión, ansiedad y consecuencias 
funcionales) y el riesgo de desarrollar TEPT en individuos con trauma agudo. 
Además, probaremos si los problemas del sueño previos a la terapia predicen el 
desarrollo de síntomas de TEPT a posteriori. Método: Nuestro objetivo es 
reclutar 104 pacientes que serán asignados en forma aleatoria a una intervención 
para el sueño basado en una aplicación utilizando CBT-I o un diario del sueño 
como un complemento al tratamiento habitual (TAU por sus siglas en inglés) en un 
centro ambulatorio para pacientes con trauma agudo. La calidad del sueño, los 
síntomas de TEPT y el funcionamiento diario serán medidos antes, después de la 
intervención y al seguimiento 6 meses después. Conclusiones: A nuestro entender, 
este RCT multicéntrico es el primer estudio en usar dCBT-I como una intervención 
temprana para trauma. Éste puede mejorar la comprensión del papel del sueño en 
el desarrollo del TEPT y tiene el potencial de contribuir al desarrollo de una 
intervención temprana fácil de usar para personas con trauma agudo.

BACKGROUND: Extensive literature has shown the effectiveness of cognitive 
behavioral therapy in treating perinatal depression, but little is known about 
the effectiveness of its technology-based version.
AIM: The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of technology-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in 
women suffering from or at risk of experiencing perinatal depression.
METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched until February 2023 for articles 
published in English. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity 
was assessed using the I2 statistics and Cochran's Q chi-squared test. 
Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed, and quality 
appraisals at the study and outcome levels were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 16 randomized controlled trials were included in the review. 
Results from meta-analyses suggest that technology-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy has a medium effect in reducing perinatal depressive symptoms and a 
small effect in reducing perinatal anxiety symptoms. Overall, women suffering 
from or at risk of perinatal depression may benefit from technology-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy.
LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Future interventions can be improved by addressing 
both perinatal depression and anxiety, paying more attention to antenatal women 
to prevent postnatal mental health issues, and using self-guided mobile 
applications for accessibility.

Introduction: Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) and their 
integration into routine psychotherapy (i.e., blended therapy) can offer a means 
of complementing psychotherapy in a flexible and resource optimized way. 
Objective: The present study will evaluate the non-inferiority, 
cost-effectiveness, and safety of two versions of integrated blended 
psychotherapy for depression and anxiety compared to standard cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: A three-armed multicenter cluster-randomized 
controlled non-inferiority trial will be conducted comparing two implementations 
of blended psychotherapy (PSYCHOnlineTHERAPYfix/flex) compared to CBT. 
Seventy-five outpatient psychotherapists with a CBT-license will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each of them is asked to include 12 patients on average with 
depressive or anxiety disorders resulting in a total sample size of N = 900. All 
patients receive up to a maximum of 16 psychotherapy sessions, either as routine 
CBT or alternating with Online self-help sessions (fix: 8/8; flex: 0-16). 
Assessments will be conducted at patient study inclusion (pre-treatment) and 6, 
12, 18, and 24 weeks and 12 months post-inclusion. The primary outcome is 
depression and anxiety severity at 18 weeks post-inclusion (post-treatment) 
using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary 
outcomes are depression and anxiety remission, treatment response, 
health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, working alliance, 
psychotherapy adherence, and patient safety. Additionally, several potential 
moderators and mediators including patient characteristics and attitudes toward 
the interventions will be examined, complemented by ecological day-to-day 
digital behavior variables via passive smartphone sensing as part of an 
integrated smart-sensing sub-study. Data-analysis will be performed on an 
intention-to-treat basis with additional per-protocol analyses. In addition, 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted from a societal 
and a public health care perspective. Additionally, qualitative interviews on 
acceptance, feasibility, and optimization potential will be conducted and 
analyzed. Discussion: PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY will provide evidence on blended 
psychotherapy in one of the largest ever conducted psychotherapy trials. If 
shown to be non-inferior and cost-effective, PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY has the 
potential to innovate psychotherapy in the near future by extending the ways of 
conducting psychotherapy. The rigorous health care services approach will 
facilitate a timely implementation of blended psychotherapy into standard care. 
Trial Registration: The trial is registered in the German Clinical Trials 
Register (DRKS00023973; date of registration: December 28th 2020).

Introduction: Young people (aged 15-24) living with HIV/AIDS (YPLHIV) in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experience higher rates of mental health conditions 
compared to their uninfected peers. Research and practitioners have expressed 
interest in designing and implementing mental health interventions to improve 
the mental health and well-being of this vulnerable population. However, there 
is limited effort to systematically synthesize existing evidence on mental 
health interventions for YPLHIV to address salient questions relating to 
effectiveness, characteristics, practice issues among others to inform practice, 
and future research endeavors. This systematic review was conducted to take 
stock and synthesize existing data to address the above issues. Methods: This 
review was conducted per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was 
implemented, utilizing five electronic databases and gray literature 
repositories. Studies (1) from SSA that focused on young adults with HIV/AIDS 
and (2) examined the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance mental 
health outcomes and treatment adherence were included. Two independent reviewers 
were involved in the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, 
resolving discrepancies by consensus or consultation. Data were presented using 
narrative syntheses. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, with a 
total sample size of 1510 participants, reporting on interventions from six 
African countries. The interventions were categorized as follows: cognitive 
behavioral therapy-based, family-based, peer support, and community-based. The 
interventions showed mixed effectiveness for depression, with three studies 
demonstrating significant improvements while four showed no substantial change. 
The only study on improving anxiety reported promising results. Four 
interventions positively influenced ART adherence, although with varying 
magnitudes. Peer support, family-based approach, and digital (mobile phone) 
approaches were identified as effective strategies. Conclusions: The review 
showed promising approaches to improve mental health in YPLHIV, namely, through 
peer support, family-based, and digital (i.e., mobile phone) approaches. 
Although the results were mixed for depression and limited but positive for 
anxiety, several interventions improved ART adherence. However, the modest 
evidence base and varied measurement approaches necessitate more research across 
SSA.

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders and is estimated 
to become the leading cause of disability worldwide by 2030. Increasing access 
to effective treatment for depression is a major societal challenge. In this 
context, the increasing use of computers in the form of laptops or smartphones 
has made it feasible to increase access to mental healthcare through digital 
technology. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a 14-week 
therapist-guided Internet-delivered program for patients with major depression 
undergoing routine care. From 2015 to 2018, 105 patients were included in the 
study. For depressive symptoms, we identified significant within-group effect 
sizes (post-treatment: d = 0.96; 6-month follow-up: d = 1.21). We also found 
significant effects on secondary anxiety and insomnia symptoms (d = 0.55-0.92). 
Clinically reliable improvement was reported by 48% of those undergoing the main 
parts of the treatment, whereas 5% of the participants reported a clinically 
significant deterioration. However, a large proportion of patients showed no 
clinically reliable change. In summary, the study identified large treatment 
effects, but also highlighted room for improvement in the usability of the 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a chronic condition; its prevalence is 
expected to grow with the aging trend of high-income countries. Internet-based 
cognitive-behavioral therapy has proven efficacy in treating major depressive 
disorder.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing a community internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
intervention (Super@, the Spanish program for the MasterMind project) for 
treating major depressive disorder.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the Super@ program was assessed with the 
Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on 
Active and Healthy Ageing tool, using a 3-state Markov model. Data from the cost 
and effectiveness of the intervention were prospectively collected from the 
implementation of the program by a health care provider in Badalona, Spain; the 
corresponding data for usual care were gathered from the literature. The health 
states, transition probabilities, and utilities were computed using Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 scores.
RESULTS: The analysis was performed using data from 229 participants using the 
Super@ program. Results showed that the intervention was more costly than usual 
care; the discounted (3%) and nondiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were €29,367 and €26,484 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively 
(approximately US $35,299 and $31,833, respectively). The intervention was 
cost-effective based on the €30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold typically 
applied in Spain (equivalent to approximately $36,060). According to the 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, the potential reduction of costs associated 
with intervention scale-up would reduce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of the intervention, although it remained more costly than usual care. A 
discount in the incremental effects up to 5% exceeded the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €30,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The Super@ program, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
intervention for treating major depressive disorder, cost more than treatment as 
usual. Nevertheless, its implementation in Spain would be cost-effective from 
health care and societal perspectives, given the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€30,000 compared with treatment as usual.

OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study examines the experiences of older adults with 
Empower@Home, an older adult-centered, layperson-supported internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for depression, with a focus on 
engagement-related factors.
METHODS: Adults aged 50 or older with at least mild depressive symptoms were 
recruited from multiple resources. A random subset of participants was invited 
for a semi-structured qualitative interview during a post-intervention 
assessment conducted over the phone (N = 148). Interviews were recorded and 
transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded in a multi-phase, team-based 
approach utilizing inductive coding techniques, followed by thematic analysis to 
identify key themes.
RESULTS: Six key themes regarding engagement emerged: the importance of a 
structured, skills-based, and self-paced approach; the essential role of weekly 
coaching for accountability, web interface's ease of use and accessibility; 
narrative engagement dynamics; enhanced learning through multimodal instruction; 
and tailoring challenges in iCBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adult-centered, layperson-supported, and multimodal iCBT can 
effectively engage older adults in managing their mental health.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: iCBT programs can be integrated into various community 
aging settings. By leveraging each setting's strengths and involving a range of 
professionals, these programs can play an important role in enhancing older 
adults' mental health.

BACKGROUND: Indigenous Australian youth (aged 15 to 34) have up to four times 
the risk of suicide compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts. Barriers to 
help-seeking include shame, feared loss of autonomy and negative attitudes 
towards healthcare providers. The use of mobile devices and apps continues to 
rise amongst young people, thus presenting opportunities to utilize these aids 
in overcoming help-seeking barriers. Apps have been shown to assist in several 
health-related areas, including weight loss and smoking cessation, although no 
apps have as yet been evaluated for suicide prevention. Moreover, there is a 
lack of research that scientifically evaluates suicide prevention interventions 
within Indigenous communities.
METHODS/DESIGN: In this study, a recently developed self-help app will be 
evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention is based on 
acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural 
therapy. It is aimed at participants who have suicidal thoughts but who are not 
actively suicidal. In total, 150 participants will be randomly allocated to the 
intervention-condition (N = 75) or to the wait-list control condition (N = 75). 
Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, post-test and 6 weeks follow-up. 
The primary outcome measure is a reduction in frequency and intensity of 
suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of depression, 
anxiety and impulsivity.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help 
app for suicidal thoughts amongst young Indigenous people. Several limitations 
and strengths of the design are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety incur significant personal and societal 
costs. Effective psychotherapies exist, such as cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT); however, timely access to quality care is limited by myriad barriers. 
Blended care therapy models incorporate traditional face-to-face therapy with 
scalable, digital components of care, expanding the reach of evidence-based 
care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a blended 
care CBT program (BC-CBT) in real-world settings and examine the unique impacts 
of the (1) digital components of care (video lessons and digital exercises) and 
(2) phase of treatment (early versus late) in decreasing symptoms of anxiety and 
depression.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 3401 US-based individuals 
enrolled in a BC-CBT program, who presented with clinical levels of depression 
and/or anxiety. The treatment program consisted of regular therapy sessions 
augmented by clinician-assigned digital video lessons and exercises. A growth 
curve model incorporating time-varying covariates examined the relationship 
between engagement with BCT components (ie, therapy sessions, digital video 
lessons, and digital exercises) during the early (weeks 0-7) and late (weeks 
8-15) phases of treatment, and weekly symptom reports on depression and anxiety 
measures.
RESULTS: On average, a significant decline in depression and anxiety symptoms 
was observed during the initial weeks of treatment (P<.001), with a continued, 
though slower, decline over subsequent weeks (P<.001). Each session completed 
was associated with significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.72) and depression 
(b=-0.83) in the early phase, as well as in the late phase (anxiety, b=-0.47; 
depression, b=-0.27). Significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.15) and depression 
(b=-0.12) were observed for time spent on video lessons (measured in 10-minute 
intervals) in the early phase of treatment. Engaging with exercises was 
associated with statistically significant increases in anxiety symptoms (b=0.03) 
during the early phase of treatment. However, sensitivity analyses examining the 
effects of exercises in isolation revealed significant decreases in anxiety 
(b=-0.05) in the early phase, suggesting a potential suppression effect in the 
larger model.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a retrospective cohort design, therapy sessions and digital 
video lessons were uniquely predictive of improvements in depression and anxiety 
symptoms, and their effects were modulated based on the phase of treatment 
(early vs late). Future research should investigate whether other treatment 
variables, such as therapeutic alliance or familiarity with technology, are 
related to differential effects on various components of care.

UK.

RATIONALE: NICE guidelines recommend offering computerised Cognitive Behavioural 
Therapy (cCBT) to young people with mild mental health issues to ensure early 
treatment access and reduce service demand. Emerging evidence suggests cCBT 
reduces symptoms, but further evaluation is needed. SilverCloud is a recommended 
digital CBT programme.
AIMS: Evaluate a pilot trial of SilverCloud in CAMHS at a local NHS Foundation 
Trust.
OBJECTIVES: (1) Symptomology: Is there a change in depression or anxiety 
symptoms after using the intervention? (measured by outcome scores); (2) 
Adoption: What was young people's engagement with SilverCloud? (measured by time 
spent on the platform and uptake); (3) Satisfaction: How satisfied were young 
people with SilverCloud? (measured by module feedback ratings and a 
questionnaire).
METHODS: The SilverCloud intervention for young people was evaluated over 9 
months. Reductions in symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and low 
mood were measured using the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(RCADS), GAD, and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) subscales. Adoption was 
measured by time spent on SilverCloud and intervention uptake. Satisfaction was 
measured by module feedback ratings and a questionnaire.
RESULTS: Ninety-one people were offered SilverCloud, 77% started, 46% completed 
it and 27% disengaged. Thirty-two participants completed SilverCloud during the 
evaluation (12 CYP and 20 parents). No statistically significant reduction was 
found in any subscale. Satisfaction was varied; 94% rated the intervention 
favourably, but no participants reported behaviour changes due to the 
intervention.
CONCLUSION: This evaluation suggests tentative pessimism regarding SilverCloud's 
benefits. However, due to significant challenges and limitations, further 
analysis is recommended. Recommendations were given for local services.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the effectiveness of the eBEfree program, a 
12-session app-based version of a previously tested psychological intervention 
(BEfree) that combines psycho-education, self-compassion, mindfulness, and 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to reduce binge-eating symptoms.
METHOD: Two-hundred participants with recurrent elevated binge-eating symptoms 
and a higher body weight were enrolled in a remote parallel-group randomized 
trial, of which 142 completed the initial assessment (70 in the intervention 
group). The end-of-treatment and follow-up assessments were conducted 12 weeks 
after the initial assessment and 26 weeks after the end of treatment, 
respectively. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyzes were undertaken using 
frequentist linear mixed models and Bayesian hierarchical models to test the 
intervention effectiveness.
RESULTS: 43 (waitlist control) and 29 (intervention) participants completed the 
end-of-treatment assessment, showing a high attrition rate (51%). ITT analyzes 
showed the eBEfree program to be associated with a significant reduction in 
binge eating symptomatology from baseline to end-of-treatment (β = -9.49, 
ρ < 0.0001, g = -1.17), and from end-of-treatment to 26-weeks follow-up 
(β = -6.01, ρ = 0.04, g = -1.08). At end-of-treatment, the intervention was also 
associated with a decrease in body mass index and depression symptomatology, as 
well as an improvement in dimensions of self-criticism and mindfulness. More 
than 80% of participants rated the quality of the program as positive and 
helpful.
DISCUSSION: This trial suggests potential benefits of the eBEfree program to 
help individuals manage symptoms of binge-eating more effectively, reduce 
weight, and improve well-being and mental health. The intervention benefits 
should be confirmed in future larger trials.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Treating binge-eating (BE) symptoms and associated 
comorbidities might be challenging for mental health services. Digital and 
app-based interventions can be a valuable resource to help people manage 
symptoms and improve well-being and mental health. The current trial suggests 
the potential benefits of an app-based intervention (eBEfree program) to help 
people reduce BE symptoms and develop psychological strategies to promote 
well-being and mental health.

BACKGROUND: Digital, self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
interventions circumvent many barriers to in-person therapy for young people 
(aged 12-24 years), although adherence to these interventions is low. The 
absence or insufficient disclosure of recommendations or instructions for 
appropriate use may account for this. As such, many young people may not 
self-administer these interventions appropriately or receive the optimal degree 
of treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on digital 
CBT for depression and anxiety in young people to describe how appropriate use 
has been defined and communicated to users as instructions for use, to describe 
how adherence has been measured, and to determine the associations between 
adherence and treatment outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted with 2 reviewers (SHL and MRA) 
extracting data independently. Overall, 4 electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, 
PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched in April 2021 for studies that met 
the following inclusion criteria: participants aged between 12 and 24 years, 
evaluated a digital CBT intervention targeting depression or anxiety, and 
reported instructions or recommendations for use or measures of adherence. 
Studies that evaluated non-CBT interventions or cognitive- or behavioral-only 
interventions were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of 
Multiple Study Designs.
RESULTS: There were 32 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 
(88%) were unique studies (N=16,578 youths). Definitions of appropriate use 
varied among the different interventions in terms of intended recipients, 
duration and frequency of use, and the features used to support engagement and 
adherence to appropriate use definitions. Reporting of appropriate use 
definitions in studies was inconsistent, with no study systematically describing 
components of appropriate use or providing information on how recommendations 
for use were relayed to users. Most often, definitions of appropriate use were 
derived from the study protocol and descriptions of intervention features. 
Adherence was mostly operationalized as the degree of intervention completion; 
however, reporting of adherence data was heterogeneous. There was little 
evidence of an association between degree of use and outcomes in the 9 studies 
that examined this.
CONCLUSIONS: Definitions of appropriate use are unique to each digital CBT 
intervention. However, statements of appropriate use are not systematically 
reported in the literature. Furthermore, the extent to which recommendations for 
use are communicated to users is not routinely reported. Despite unique 
definitions of appropriate use, adherence was most often generically 
operationalized as the degree of intervention completion and was not 
consistently associated with outcomes. We proposed a framework to promote 
systematic reporting of definitions of appropriate use for digital interventions 
to provide guidance to users and to assist the development of appropriate and 
nuanced measures of adherence.

There is a dearth of published research on uptake and utility of mental health 
apps in India, despite a rising global trend in the application of technology in 
the field of mental health. We describe the development and pilot testing of a 
self-help intervention for depression, PUSH-D (Practice and Use Self-Help for 
Depression) for urban Indians. This guided self-help app, with essential and 
optional zone sections, was developed to provide a comprehensive coverage of 
therapeutic strategies drawn from cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal 
therapy, supportive psychotherapy, and positive psychology. Pilot testing was 
carried out using a single group pre-, post- and follow-up design in 78 eligible 
participants. Participants were typically young adults with major depression or 
dysthymia and significant impairment in functioning. Almost two-thirds of the 
participants had never sought professional mental health help. Significant 
reductions in depression and improvement in the functioning and well-being were 
notedon standardized measures in participants completing all 10 essential zone 
sections. These gains were maintained at follow-up. The results were similar for 
partial completers, who completed fiveout of the 10 essential sections. PUSH-D 
is one of the first indigenously developed self-help apps for depression and it 
shows promise in reducing the treatment gap for depression in India.

BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in digital platforms as a means of 
implementing scalable, accessible, and cost-effective mental health 
interventions in the workplace. However, little is known about the efficacy of 
such interventions when delivered to employee groups.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy 
of a digital mental health platform for the workplace, which incorporates 
evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and 
commitment therapy. A total of 3 brief, unguided interventions designed to 
address stress, anxiety, and resilience, respectively, are evaluated. The 
primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the study methods and 
interventions in preparation for a definitive randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: The study used a fully remote, parallel, multi-arm, external pilot 
randomized controlled trial, with 3 intervention arms and a no-intervention 
control group. Participants were working adults representative of the general UK 
population with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity who were recruited from a 
web-based participant platform. Primary outcomes included objective and 
self-report measures of feasibility, acceptability, engagement, transferability, 
relevance, and negative effects. Secondary outcomes included 4 self-report 
measures of mental health and well-being, completed at baseline (time point 0 
[t0]), postintervention (time point 1 [t1]), and the 1-month follow-up (time 
point 2 [t2]). Secondary outcomes were analyzed via linear mixed-effects models 
using intention-to-treat principles. Preregistered criteria for progression to a 
definitive trial were evaluated.
RESULTS: Data were collected between January and March of 2021. A total of 383 
working adult participants meeting trial eligibility were randomized, of whom 
356 (93%) were retained at t2. Objective engagement data showed that 67.8% 
(196/289) of participants randomized to an intervention arm completed their 
intervention. Overall, 87.1% (203/233) of participants reported being satisfied 
or very satisfied with their intervention and rated the quality of their 
intervention as good or excellent. All intervention groups reported 
significantly greater improvements than the control group on at least one 
secondary outcome at t1, with between-group Hedges g effect sizes for the pooled 
interventions ranging from 0.25 (95% CI 0.05-0.46) to 0.43 (95% CI 0.23-0.64). 
All the improvements were maintained at t2.
CONCLUSIONS: The study methods were feasible, and all preregistered criteria for 
progression to a definitive trial were met. Several minor protocol amendments 
were noted. Preliminary efficacy findings suggest that the study interventions 
may result in improved mental health outcomes when offered to working adults.

GOALS: To test the efficacy of a self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) app compared with an active control app.
BACKGROUND: IBS is a disorder of gut-brain interaction that can result in 
significant distress, disability, and psychiatric co-morbidity. CBT is an 
effective treatment for IBS. Self-help CBT apps can increase accessibility but 
should be tested against active controls.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (NCT04665271) compared a CBT for IBS 
self-help app (Zemedy) to an active education, lifestyle management, relaxation, 
and mindfulness control app. A total of 453 individuals were screened in and 
offered allocation to treatment. Participants who actually downloaded their 
assigned app (N=267) were evenly split between the CBT app (N=136) and the 
active control (N=131). Follow-up data (CBT N=74, control N=82) were collected 
immediately post-treatment, at which point the control group was offered 
crossover to CBT. Follow-up data were collected at 3 (N=65) and 6 (N=32) months. 
Primary outcomes included IBS symptom severity and IBS quality of life. 
Secondary outcomes included catastrophizing, visceral anxiety, fear of food, and 
depression.
RESULTS: At post-treatment, the CBT group improved significantly across all 
outcomes. The control group also improved on all outcomes except fear of food. 
In the intent-to-treat analysis the CBT group improved significantly more than 
the control group on both primary and secondary outcomes except depression. 
Gains were maintained at 3 and 6 months, although attrition was considerable.
CONCLUSION: Self-help CBT for IBS may be effective and can be delivered 
successfully through apps, although we did not have data on engagement. 
Psychoeducation about symptom management strategies, relaxation, and mindfulness 
are active treatment components, but CBT is better at addressing underlying 
maintaining factors like catastrophizing, visceral anxiety, and fear of food.

Despite the high prevalence of comorbid depression in people living with 
coronary artery disease (CAD), uptake of psychological treatment is generally 
low. This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of an internet-based 
cognitive-behavioral (iCBT) depression intervention for people with CAD and 
depressive symptoms.
METHODS: People with CAD and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) were randomly 
assigned to the eight modules comprising iCBT (N = 18), or waitlist-control 
(N = 16). Measures were taken at baseline (t1) and at post-treatment (eight 
weeks after randomization, t2). Feasibility-related outcomes were recruitment 
strategy, study attrition, intervention dropout, satisfaction, negative effects 
as well as the potential of the intervention to affect likely outcomes in a 
future full-scale trial (depression, anxiety, quality of life, fear of 
progression). Data analyses were based on intention-to-treat principles. Linear 
regression models were used to detect between group differences. Linear Mixed 
Models were used to model potential changes over time.
RESULTS: This trial was terminated prior to a-priori defined sample size has 
been reached given low recruitment success as well as high intervention dropout 
(88%) and study attrition (23%). On average, participants in the intervention 
group completed M = 2.78 (SD = 3.23) modules. Participants in the waitlist 
control group barely started one module (M = 0.82, SD = 1.81). The satisfaction 
with the intervention was low (M = 20.6, SD = 0.88). Participants reported no 
negative effects attributed to the iCBT. Differences between groups with regard 
to depression, anxiety, fear of progression and quality of life remained 
non-significant (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This trial failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants. 
Future work should explore potential pitfalls with regards to the reach and 
persuasiveness of internet interventions for people living with CAD. The study 
gives important indications for future studies with regard to the need for new 
ideas to reach and treat people with CAD and depression.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression in children and adolescents are undertreated. 
Computer- and Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (cCBT) may be an 
attractive treatment alternative to regular face-to-face treatment.This 
meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether cCBT is effective for treating symptoms 
of anxiety and depression in youth.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical 
databases (Pubmed, Cochrane controlled trial register, PsychInfo) up to December 
4, 2013. Only randomized controlled trials in which a computer-, Internet- or 
mobile-based cognitive behavioral intervention targeting either depression, 
anxiety or both in children or adolescents up to the age of 25 were compared to 
a control condition were selected. We employed a random-effects pooling model in 
overall effect analyses and a mixed effect model for sub-group analyses. 
Searches resulted in identifying 13 randomized trials, including 796 children 
and adolescents that met inclusion criteria. Seven studies were directed at 
treating anxiety, four studies at depression, and two were of a transdiagnostic 
nature, targeting both anxiety and depression. The overall mean effect size 
(Hedges' g) of cCBT on symptoms of anxiety or depression at post-test was g=0.72 
(95% CI:0.55-0.90, numbers needed to be treated (NNT)=2.56). Heterogeneity was 
low (I²=20.14%, 95% CI: 0-58%). The superiority of cCBT over controls was 
evident for interventions targeting anxiety (g=0.68; 95% CI: 0.45-0.92; p < 
.001; NNT=2.70) and for interventions targeting depression (g=0.76; 95% CI: 
0.41-0.12; p < .001; NNT=2.44) as well as for transdiagnostic interventions 
(g=0.94; 95% CI: 0.23-2.66; p < .001; NNT=2.60).
CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the efficacy of cCBT in the treatment 
of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth. Hence, such interventions may be a 
promising treatment alternative when evidence based face-to-face treatment is 
not feasible. Future studies should examine long-term effects of treatments and 
should focus on obtaining patient-level data from existing studies, to perform 
an individual patient data meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders in later life. 
Digital intelligence interventions overcome the limitations of conventional 
psychotherapy and offer new treatments for depression and anxiety. However, the 
effectiveness among older adults remains unclear.
METHODS: Databases including Pubmed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, 
Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for Randomized Controlled 
Trials (RCTs) from inception to November 22, 2023. Statistical analyses were 
conducted using Stata 18.0 and Review Manager 5.4.
RESULTS: The initial search found 9369 papers, with 21 meeting the inclusion 
criteria (e.g., RCTs involving older adults aged 50 and older that assessed 
digital intelligence interventions on depression and anxiety symptoms). 
Meta-analyses revealed that, compared to control groups, digital intelligence 
interventions significantly reduced depression symptoms (SMD: -0.58; 95 % CI: 
-0.80, -0.35) and anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.39; 95 % CI: -0.58, -0.19). Subgroup 
analysis revealed that internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT), 
interventions lasting 7 to 10 weeks, and the use of the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales, 
especially in other regions, had the most pronounced effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital intelligence interventions reduce depressive and anxious 
symptoms in older adults, supporting the development of evidence-based treatment 
guidelines in the digital era.

Technologies (CBITs), Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,

BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there is no well-articulated process for the 
design of culturally informed behavioral intervention technologies.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the early stages of such a process, illustrated 
by the methodology for the ongoing development of a behavioral intervention 
technology targeting generalized anxiety disorder and major depression among 
young sexual minority men.
METHODS: We integrated instructional design for Internet behavioral intervention 
technologies with greater detail on information sources that can identify user 
needs in understudied populations, as well as advances in the understanding of 
technology-specific behavioral intervention technology dimensions that may need 
to be culturally tailored.
RESULTS: General psychological theory describing how to effect change in the 
clinical target is first integrated with theory describing potentially malleable 
factors that help explain the clinical problem within the population. Additional 
information sources are then used to (1) evaluate the theory, (2) identify 
population-specific factors that may affect users' ability to relate to and 
benefit from the behavioral intervention technology, and (3) establish specific 
skills, attitudes, knowledge, etc, required to change malleable factors posited 
in the theory. User needs result from synthesis of this information. Product 
requirements are then generated through application of the user needs to 
specific behavioral intervention technology dimensions (eg, technology 
platform). We provide examples of considerations relevant to each stage of this 
process and how they were applied.
CONCLUSIONS: This process can guide the initial design of other culturally 
informed behavioral intervention technologies. This first attempt to create a 
systematic design process can spur development of guidelines for design of 
behavioral intervention technologies aimed to reduce health disparities.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has identified that men experiencing depression do 
not always access appropriate health services. Web-based interventions represent 
an alternative treatment option for men, are effective in reducing anxiety and 
depression, and have potential for wide dissemination. However, men do not 
access Web-based programs at the same rate as women. Programs with content 
explicitly tailored to men's mental health needs are required.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the applicability of Man Central, a new Web and 
mobile phone intervention for men with depression. The impact of the use of Man 
Central on depression, resilience, and work and social functioning was assessed.
METHODS: A recruitment flier was distributed via social media, email networks, 
newsletters, research registers, and partner organizations. A single-group, 
repeated measures design was used. The primary outcome was symptoms of 
depression. Secondary outcomes included externalizing symptoms, resilience, and 
work and social functioning. Man Central comprises regular mood, symptom, and 
behavior monitoring, combined with three 15-min interactive sessions. Clinical 
features are grounded in cognitive behavior therapy and problem-solving therapy. 
A distinguishing feature is the incorporation of positive strategies identified 
by men as useful in preventing and managing depression. Participants were 
directed to use Man Central for a period of 4 weeks. Linear mixed modeling with 
intention-to-treat analysis assessed associations between the intervention and 
the primary and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 144 men aged between 18 and 68 years and with at least mild 
depression enrolled in the study. The symptoms most often monitored by men 
included motivation (471 instances), depression (399), sleep (323), anxiety 
(316), and stress (262). Reminders were scheduled by 60.4% (87/144). Significant 
improvements were observed in depression symptoms (P<.001, d=0.68), depression 
risk, and externalizing symptoms (P<.001, d=0.88) and work and social 
functioning (P<.001, d=0.78). No change was observed in measures of resilience. 
Participants reported satisfaction with the program, with a majority saying that 
it was easy (42/51, 82%) and convenient (41/51, 80%) to use. Study attrition was 
high; 27.1% (39/144) and 8.3% (12/144) of the participants provided complete 
follow-up data and partial follow-up data, respectively, whereas the majority 
(93/144, 64.6%) did not complete follow-up measures.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary evaluation demonstrated the potential of using 
electronic health (eHealth) tools to deliver self-management strategies to men 
with depressive symptoms. Man Central may meet the treatment needs of a subgroup 
of depressed men who are willing to engage with an e-mental health program. With 
further research, it may provide an acceptable option to those unwilling or 
unable to access traditional mental health services. Given the limitations of 
the study design, prospective studies are required, using controlled designs to 
further elucidate the effect of the program over time.

Testing an Evidence-Based Self-Help Program for Infertility-Related Distress: 
Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.

BACKGROUND: Infertility-the inability to achieve pregnancy despite ≥12 months of 
focused attempts to conceive-is experienced by 1 in 6 couples. Women typically 
carry a disproportionate share of the psychological burden associated with 
infertility, experiencing poor quality of life, and 30%-40% experiencing 
depressive mood or anxiety. Unfortunately, currently available psychological 
interventions targeting infertility-related distress are associated with modest 
effects.
OBJECTIVE: Our team, in collaboration with patient advisors, has designed a 
self-help intervention for infertility-related distress involving 7 weekly 
10-minute videos addressing the cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal 
challenges associated with infertility, delivered through a mobile app. A 
feasibility study suggests that it is well accepted and highly effective in 
reducing symptoms of anxiety and depressed mood among distressed individuals 
dealing with infertility. This study represents the next step in this line of 
research: a fully powered randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention 
to a waitlist control group.
METHODS: We will recruit 170 individuals struggling to become pregnant in Canada 
or the United States to be randomized to our 7-week self-help program or a 
treatment-as-usual condition. The primary outcome will be fertility quality of 
life, while secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, anxious 
symptoms, and relationship quality, assessed before and after the program as 
well as biweekly for 16 weeks following completion of the program. Self-reported 
health care use and the presence of diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, 
assessed through a structured psychiatric interview, will also be assessed 
immediately following the intervention and at the 16-week follow-up assessment. 
Treatment adherence and retention will also be recorded throughout the 
intervention. Multilevel modeling will compare the intervention arm to the 
treatment-as-usual condition in terms of all continuous outcomes across the 9 
measurement points. Logistic regression will be used to assess the occurrence of 
mood and anxiety disorders in the 2 treatment arms at the posttreatment 
assessment as well as at the 16-week follow-up. Sensitivity analyses will 
examine potential treatment moderators: membership in the LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual) communities, baseline 
fertility quality of life, cultural background, disability status, and pursuit 
of conception through medical intervention.
RESULTS: We expect our intervention to be more effective than treatment-as-usual 
in improving all mental health parameters assessed and decreasing health care 
use related to both mental and reproductive health. Effects are expected to be 
larger with decreasing baseline quality of life and equally effective regardless 
of membership in the LGBTQIA+ communities, cultural background, or disability 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: If our intervention is successful, this would suggest that it 
should be scaled up and made publicly available. The availability of this 
program would fill an important gap in light of the high rates of 
psychopathology among those experiencing infertility and considering the current 
lack of effective psychotherapy approaches for infertility.

Background and Objectives: This systematic review aims to present the latest 
developments in next-generation CBT interventions of digital support tools, 
teletherapies, and personalized treatment modules in enhancing accessibility, 
improving treatment adherence, and optimizing therapeutic outcomes for 
depression. Materials and Methods: This review analyzed 81 PRISMA-guided studies 
on the efficacy, feasibility, and applicability of NG-CBT approaches. Other 
important innovations include web-based interventions, AI-operated chatbots, and 
teletherapy platforms, each of which serves as a critical challenge in 
delivering mental health care. Key messages have emerged regarding technological 
readiness, patient engagement, and the changing role of therapists within the 
digital context of care. Results: Findings indicate that NG-CBT interventions 
improve treatment accessibility and engagement while maintaining clinical 
effectiveness. Personalized digital tools enhance adherence, and teletherapy 
platforms provide scalable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional 
therapy. Conclusions: Such developments promise great avenues for decreasing the 
global burden of depression and enhancing the quality of life through novel, 
accessible, and high-quality therapeutic approaches.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is a common precursor to depression; yet, the 
potential for insomnia treatment to prevent depression has not been 
demonstrated. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effectively 
reduces concurrent symptoms of insomnia and depression and can be delivered 
digitally (dCBT-I); however, it remains unclear whether treating insomnia leads 
to sustained reduction and prevention of depression. This randomized controlled 
trial examined the efficacy of dCBT-I in reducing and preventing depression over 
a 1-year follow-up period.
METHODS: Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition (DSM-5) insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to receive dCBT-I 
or an attentional control. The follow-up sample included 358 patients in the 
dCBT-I condition and 300 patients in the online sleep education condition. The 
primary outcome measure was relative rate ratios for depression at 1-year 
follow-up. Insomnia responses to treatment were also tested as predictors of 
incident depression at the 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, depression severity continued to be significantly 
lower in the dCBT-I condition relative to control. In addition, the number of 
individuals who reported no depression at 1-year follow-up was 51% higher in the 
dCBT-I condition relative to control. In those with minimal to no depression at 
baseline, the incident rate of moderate-to-severe depression at 1-year follow-up 
was reduced by half in the dCBT-I condition relative to the control condition.
CONCLUSION: dCBT-I showed robust effects as an intervention that prevents 
depression. Future research should examine dose-response requirements and 
further characterize mechanisms of action of dCBT-I for depression prevention.

BACKGROUND: Academic procrastination is widespread among college students. 
Procrastination is strongly negatively correlated with psychological well-being, 
thus early interventions are needed. Internet- and mobile-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy (iCBT) could provide a low-threshold treatment option. Human 
guidance seems to be a decisive mechanism of change in iCBT. Persuasive design 
optimization of iCBT and guidance by a digital coach might represent a 
resource-saving alternative. The study evaluated the non-inferiority of a 
digital coach in comparison to human guidance with regard to the primary outcome 
procrastination.
METHODS: The iCBT StudiCare procrastination was optimized by principles of the 
Persuasive System Design (PSD). A total of 233 college students were randomly 
assigned to either StudiCare procrastination guided by a digital coach 
(intervention group, IG) or by a human eCoach (control group, CG). All 
participants were assessed at baseline, 4-, 8- and 12-weeks post-randomization. 
Symptom change and between-group differences were assessed with latent growth 
curve models and supported by effect size levels. The non-inferiority margin was 
set at Cohen's d = - 0.3.
RESULTS: The primary outcome procrastination measured by the Irrational 
Procrastination scale (IPS) significantly decreased across groups (γ = - 0.79, 
p < .001, Cohen's d = -0.43 to -0.89) from baseline to 12-weeks 
post-randomization. There were no significant differences between groups (γ = 
-0.03, p = .84, Cohen's d = -0.03 to 0.08). Regarding symptoms of depression, no 
significant time x group effect was found (γ = 0.26, p = .09; Cohen's d = -0.15 
to 0.21). There was also no significant time x group effect on the improvement 
of symptoms of anxiety (γ = 0.25, p = .09). However, Cohen's ds were above the 
non-inferiority margin 8-weeks (Cohen's d = 0.51) and 12-weeks 
post-randomization (Cohen's d = 0.37), preferring the CG. Of the IG, 34% and of 
the CG, 36% completed 80% of the modules.
CONCLUSIONS: The PSD optimized version of StudiCare procrastination is effective 
in reducing procrastination. The digital coach was not inferior to human 
guidance. Guidance by a digital coach in iCBT against procrastination for 
college students could be a resource-saving alternative to human guidance.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common among pregnant women. 
Internet-delivered psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy 
(iCBT) have been developed to increase accessibility and address common 
help-seeking barriers, especially during pandemic period. The objective of this 
trial is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of iCBT on reducing 
depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic with the 
overall goal of preventing depression recurrence in the first 12 months 
postpartum.
METHODS: A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted where 300 
pregnant women early in their third trimester will be screened for depression 
symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during a routine 
obstetrical visit. Eligible and consenting women with a score greater than 9 
will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either intervention group or control group. 
ICBT involving the completion of 7 weekly online modules will be delivered via a 
well-designed perinatal mental healthcare app. The primary objective is to 
evaluate the effect of iCBT on reducing depression symptoms among pregnant 
Chinese women starting from their third trimester. The secondary objectives are 
to examine the effect of iCBT on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, 
parenting stress, co-parenting relationship, and infant development.
DISCUSSION: This multi-center randomized controlled trial has been planned in 
accordance with best practices in behavioral trial design. The internet-based 
intervention addressed the needs of pregnant women during a major pandemic where 
face-to-face therapy is not preferable. The trial has a relatively large sample 
size with sufficient power to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT intervention for the 
primary and secondary outcomes. One year follow-up evaluation in the study is 
designed to determine the longer-term effect of the intervention on both 
maternal and infant outcomes. Although a limitation is the assessment of 
depression and anxiety using self-report measures, these easily incorporated and 
maternal-preferred assessments allow for real-life scalability if the 
intervention is proven to be effective.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics was approved by the institutional review board 
of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital (GKLW2020-25). 
Dissemination of results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals 
and presented at scientific conferences.
TRIAL STATUS: The first patient was enrolled on 19 August 2020. To date, 203 
participants have met eligibility requirements and been randomized to either the 
intervention group or control group. Data collection aims to be complete in 
September 2022. Date and version identifier: 2020715-version1.0.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention 
for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Digital CBT may provide a scalable means 
of delivering CBT at a population level. We investigated the efficacy of a novel 
digital CBT program in those with GAD for outcomes of anxiety, worry, depressive 
symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life.
METHODS: This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled 
trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with 
moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using 
participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 
0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from 
randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up 
(Week 10).
RESULTS: Overall, 256 participants were randomized and intention-to-treat 
analysis found Daylight reduced symptoms of anxiety compared with waitlist 
control at post-intervention, reflecting a large effect size (adjusted 
difference [95% CI]: 3.22 [2.14, 4.31], d = 1.08). Significant improvements were 
found for measures of worry; depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, 
and participant-specific quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Digital CBT (Daylight) appears to be safe and efficacious for 
symptoms of anxiety, worry, and further measures of mental health compared with 
waitlist control in individuals with GAD.

BACKGROUND: Mood disorders (anxiety, depression), sleep disorders, and 
catastrophizing lead to increased post-operative pain perception, increase in 
postoperative opioid consumption, decreased engagement with physical activity, 
and increased resource utilization in surgical patients. Psychosocial disorders 
significantly affect postoperative outcome. Unfortunately, studies focused on 
perioperative psychological assessment and treatment are scarce. We propose to 
test whether digital cognitive behavioral intervention (dCBI) can help surgical 
patients. dCBI such as RxWell™ is a proven treatment for mood disorders in 
medical patients such as reducing depression in patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease. We hypothesize that RxWell™ will also be effective in surgical 
patients. This study aims to test whether RxWell™ can improve preoperative mood 
disorders and subsequently reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirement in 
patients scheduled for primary total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA, TKA). We 
named the trial as the SuRxgWell trial.
METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled trial that will enroll primary and 
unilateral THA or TKA patients with anxiety and/or depression symptoms before 
surgery to receive the SuRxgWell dCBI program and investigate its impact on 
postoperative outcomes including postoperative pain, anxiety, depression, sleep 
disorder, and catastrophizing. After signing an informed consent, subjects will 
be screened using the PROMIS questionnaires, and subjects with a T-score of ≥ 60 
on the short Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
4a Anxiety and/or short PROMIS 4a Depression questionnaires will be randomized 
to either usual care (control group) or the cognitive behavioral intervention, 
RxWell™, plus usual care (intervention group). The control group will receive 
information on how to locate tools to address anxiety and depression, whereas 
the intervention group will have access to SuRxgWell 1 month prior to surgery 
and up to 3 months after surgery. The allocation will be 3:1 (intervention to 
control). Investigators will be blinded, but research coordinators approaching 
patients and research subjects will not. The primary outcome will be day of 
surgery anxiety or depression symptoms measured with the PROMIS Short Form v1.0 
-Anxiety 4a/Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Measure (GAD-7) and 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Secondary end points include measuring 
other health-related quality of life outcomes including sleep disturbance, 
fatigue, ability to participate in social roles, pain interference, cognitive 
function, pain catastrophizing, and physical function. Other secondary outcomes 
include collecting data about preoperative and postoperative pain scores, and 
pain medication usage, and orthopedic functional recovery at baseline, day of 
surgery, and 1, 2, and 3 months after the surgery with the Pain Catastrophizing 
Scale, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Hip injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). In addition, subjects will be asked to 
complete a GAD-7 and PHQ-8 questionnaires bi-weekly (via the RxWell™ app for the 
interventional group or REDCAP for the control group). Data about postsurgical 
complications, and resource utilization will also be recorded. We will also 
receive monthly reports measuring the usage and engagement of RxWell use for 
each participant randomized to that arm. The primary hypotheses will be assessed 
with intention-to-treat estimates, and differences in primary outcome will be 
tested using independent two sample t-tests. This trial is registered to the 
ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT05658796) and supported by the DAPM, UPMC Health 
Plan, and the NIH.
DISCUSSION: Our trial will evaluate the feasibility of digital cognitive 
behavioral intervention as a perioperative tool to improve anxiety and 
depression before and after major orthopedic surgery in comparison to education. 
If digital cognitive behavioral intervention proves to be effective, this might 
have important clinical implications, reducing the incidence of chronic 
postsurgical pain and improving outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Youth in remission of depression or anxiety have high risks of 
relapse. Relapse prevention interventions may prevent chronicity. Aim of the 
study is therefore to (1) examine efficacy of the personalised StayFine app for 
remitted youth and (2) identify high-risk groups for relapse and resilience.
METHOD AND ANALYSIS: In this Dutch single-blind parallel-group randomised 
controlled trial, efficacy of app-based monitoring combined with guided 
app-based personalised StayFine intervention modules is assessed compared with 
monitoring only. In both conditions, care as usual is allowed. StayFine modules 
plus monitoring is hypothesised to be superior to monitoring only in preventing 
relapse over 36 months. Participants (N=254) are 13-21 years and in remission of 
depression or anxiety for >2 months. Randomisation (1:1) is stratified by 
previous treatment (no treatment vs treatment) and previous episodes (1, 2 or >3 
episodes). Assessments include diagnostic interviews, online questionnaires and 
monitoring (ecological momentary assessment with optional wearable) after 0, 4, 
12, 24 and 36 months. The StayFine modules are guided by certified experts by 
experience and based on preventive cognitive therapy and ingredients of 
cognitive behavioural therapy. Personalisation is based on shared 
decision-making informed by baseline assessments and individual symptom 
networks. Time to relapse (primary outcome) is assessed by the Kiddie Schedule 
for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-lifetime version diagnostic interview. 
Intention-to-treat survival analyses will be used to examine the data. Secondary 
outcomes are symptoms of depression and anxiety, number and duration of 
relapses, global functioning, and quality of life. Mediators and moderators will 
be explored. Exploratory endpoints are monitoring and wearable outcomes.
ETHICS, FUNDING AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by METC Utrecht and is 
funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development 
(636310007). Results will be submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals and 
presented at (inter)national conferences.

BACKGROUND: There has been an increased need to provide specialized help for 
people with depressive and anxiety symptoms, particularly teenagers and young 
adults. There is evidence from a 2-week intervention that chatbots (eg, Woebot) 
are effective in reducing depression and anxiety, an effect that was not 
detected in the control group that was provided self-help materials. Although 
chatbots are a promising solution, there is limited scientific evidence for the 
efficacy of agent-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outside the English 
language, especially for highly inflected languages.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the efficacy of Fido, a therapy chatbot 
that uses the Polish language. It targets depressive and anxiety symptoms using 
CBT techniques. We hypothesized that participants using Fido would show a 
greater reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms than the control group.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial with 81 
participants with subclinical depression or anxiety who were recruited via 
social media. Participants were divided into experimental (interacted with a 
fully automated Fido chatbot) and control (received a self-help book) groups. 
Both intervention methods addressed topics such as general psychoeducation and 
cognitive distortion identification and modification via Socratic questioning. 
The chatbot also featured suicidal ideation identification and redirection to 
suicide hotlines. We used self-assessment scales to measure primary outcomes, 
including the levels of depression, anxiety, worry tendencies, satisfaction with 
life, and loneliness at baseline, after the 2-week intervention and at the 
1-month follow-up. We also controlled for secondary outcomes, including 
engagement and frequency of use.
RESULTS: There were no differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms between 
the groups at enrollment and baseline. After the intervention, depressive and 
anxiety symptoms were reduced in both groups (chatbot: n=36; control: n=38), 
which remained stable at the 1-month follow-up. Loneliness was not significantly 
different between the groups after the intervention, but an exploratory analysis 
showed a decline in loneliness among participants who used Fido more frequently. 
Both groups used their intervention technique with similar frequency; however, 
the control group spent more time (mean 117.57, SD 72.40 minutes) on the 
intervention than the Fido group (mean 79.44, SD 42.96 minutes).
CONCLUSIONS: We did not replicate the findings from previous (eg, Woebot) 
studies, as both arms yielded therapeutic effects. However, such results are in 
line with other research of Internet interventions. Nevertheless, Fido provided 
sufficient help to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms and decreased 
perceived loneliness among high-frequency users, which is one of the first 
pieces of evidence of chatbot efficacy with agents that use a highly inflected 
language. Further research is needed to determine the long-term, real-world 
effectiveness of Fido and its efficacy in a clinical sample.

BACKGROUND: Chronic back pain (CBP) is linked to a higher prevalence and higher 
occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and can lead to reduced quality of 
life. Unfortunately, individuals with both CBP and recurrent MDD are 
underidentified. Utilizing health care insurance data may provide a possibility 
to better identify this complex population. In addition, internet- and 
mobile-based interventions might enhance the availability of existing treatments 
and provide help to those highly burdened individuals.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial investigated the feasibility 
of recruitment via the health records of a German health insurance company. The 
study also examined user satisfaction and effectiveness of a 9-week cognitive 
behavioral therapy and Web- and mobile-based guided self-help intervention 
Get.Back in CBP patients with recurrent MDD on sick leave compared with a 
waitlist control condition.
METHODS: Health records from a German health insurance company were used to 
identify and recruit participants (N=76) via invitation letters. Study outcomes 
were measured using Web-based self-report assessments at baseline, posttreatment 
(9 weeks), and a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depressive symptom 
severity (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression); secondary outcomes 
included anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life 
(Assessment of Quality of Life), pain-related variables (Oswestry Disability 
Index, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and pain intensity), and negative 
effects (Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy).
RESULTS: The total enrollment rate with the recruitment strategy used was 1.26% 
(76/6000). Participants completed 4.8 modules (SD 2.6, range 0-7) of Get.Back. 
The overall user satisfaction was favorable (mean Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire score=24.5, SD 5.2). Covariance analyses showed a small but 
statistically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity in the 
intervention group (n=40) at posttreatment compared with the waitlist control 
group (n=36; F1,76=3.62, P=.03; d=0.28, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.74). Similar findings 
were noted for the reduction of anxiety symptoms (F1,76=10.45; P=.001; d=0.14, 
95% CI -0.31 to 0.60) at posttreatment. Other secondary outcomes were 
nonsignificant (.06≤P≤.44). At the 6-month follow-up, the difference between the 
groups with regard to reduction in depressive symptom severity was no longer 
statistically significant (F1,76=1.50, P=.11; d=0.10, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.46). The 
between-group difference in anxiety at posttreatment was maintained to follow-up 
(F1,76=2.94, P=.04; d=0.38, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.83). There were no statistically 
significant differences across groups regarding other secondary outcomes at the 
6-month follow-up (.08≤P≤.42).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that participants with comorbid depression 
and CBP on sick leave may benefit from internet- and mobile-based interventions, 
as exemplified with the positive user satisfaction ratings. The recruitment 
strategy via health insurance letter invitations appeared feasible, but more 
research is needed to understand how response rates in untreated individuals 
with CBP and comorbid depression can be increased.

BACKGROUND: Among Chinese college students, the burden of depression is 
considerably high, affecting up to 30 % of the population. Despite this burden, 
few Chinese students seek mental health treatment. In addition, depression is 
highly comorbid with other mental health disorders, such as anxiety. Scalable, 
transdiagnostic, evidence-based interventions are needed for this population.
OBJECTIVE: The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a World Health 
Organization transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention, Step-by-Step, 
to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms and improve well-being compared with 
enhanced care as usual and its implementation in a Chinese university community.
METHODS: A type 1 effectiveness-implementation two-arm, parallel, randomized 
controlled trial will be conducted. The two conditions are 1) the 5-session 
Step-by-Step program with minimal guidance by trained peer-helpers and 2) 
psychoeducational information on depression and anxiety and referrals to local 
community services. A total of 334 Chinese university students will be 
randomized with a 1:1 ratio to either of the two groups. Depression, anxiety, 
wellbeing, and client defined problems will be assessed at pre-intervention, 
post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Endline qualitative interviews and 
focus group discussions will be conducted to explore SbS implementation among 
service users, university staff, and stakeholders. Data will be analysed based 
on the intent-to-treat principle.
DISCUSSION: Step-by-Step is an innovative approach to address common mental 
health problems in populations with sufficient digital literacy. It is a 
promising intervention that can be embedded to scale mental health services 
within a university setting. It is anticipated that after successful evaluation 
of the program and its implementation in the type 1 hybrid design RCT study, 
Step-by-Step can be scaled and maintained as a low-intensity treatment in 
universities, and potentially extended to other populations within the Chinese 
community.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia and depression frequently co-occur. Significant barriers 
preclude a majority of patients from receiving first line treatments for both 
disorders in a sequential treatment episode. Although digital versions of 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and for depression (CBTD) hold 
some promise to meet demand, especially when paired with human support, it is 
unknown whether heterogeneity of treatment effects exist, such that some 
patients would be optimally treated with single or sequential interventions.
OBJECTIVE: Describe the protocol for a two-phase, prescriptive comparative 
effectiveness study to develop and evaluate an individualized intervention rule 
(IIR) for prescribing the optimal digital treament of co-occurring insomnia and 
depression.
METHODS: The proposed sample size is 2300 U.S. military veterans with insomnia 
and depression recruited nationally (Phase 1 = 1500; Phase 2 = 800). In each 
phase, the primary endpoint will be remission of both depression and insomnia 
3 months following a 12-week intervention period. Phase 1 is a 5-arm randomized 
trial: two single digital interventions (CBT-I or CBT-D); two sequenced 
interventions (CBT-I + D or CBT-D + I); and a mood monitoring control condition. 
A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to develop the IIR. 
Phase 2 will evaluate the IIR by randomizing participants with equal allocation 
to either the IIR predicted optimal intervention for that individual or by 
randomization to one the four CBT interventions.
RESULTS: Study procedures are ongoing. Results will be reported in future 
manuscripts.
CONCLUSION: The study will generate evidence on the optimal scalable approach to 
treat co-occurring insomnia and depression.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of digital psychotherapies for 
depression and anxiety. We conducted a systematic review and network 
meta-analyses (NMA) to make comparisons of digital psychotherapies.
METHODS: A bayesian NMA was conducted in this study. The databases including 
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials and CINAL were searched for all eligible randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) published from Jan 1, 2012 to Oct 1, 2022. We used the Cochrane 
Collaboration's Risk of bias tool for quality assessment. The primary outcomes 
were set as a standardized mean difference model in efficacy to describe 
continuous outcomes. We used STATA and WinBUGS to conduct a bayesian network 
meta-analysis of all interventions based on a random-effects model. This study 
was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022374558.
RESULTS: From the retrieved 16,750 publications, we included 72 RCTs (13,096 
participants) with the overall medium quality and above. In terms of depression 
scale, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective than TAU (SMDs 
0.53) and NT (SMDs 0.98). In terms of anxiety scale, CBT (SMDs 0.68; SMDs 0.72) 
and exercise therapy (ERT) (SMDs 1.01; SMDs 1.05) were more effective than TAU 
and NT.
LIMITATIONS: Uneven quality of literature, simple network, and subjective 
judgment.
CONCLUSION: Based on NMA results, we suggest that CBT, which is the most 
commonly used digital technology, should be preferred among digital 
psychotherapy for relieving depression and anxiety symptoms. Digital exercise 
therapy is an effective strategy to relieve some anxiety problems in the context 
of COVID-19.

Implementing Digital Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder 
in Routine Psychiatric Appointments: A Pilot Project in a Rural Population.

Sampson E.

Psychotherapy is well-established as an effective treatment for major depressive 
disorder (MDD). However, many individuals with MDD in rural areas of the United 
States do not have access to psychotherapy. Self-management (SM) strategies are 
now the standard of care for chronic medical conditions and may be a viable 
alternative for individuals without access to psychotherapy. The current article 
describes the implementation of a 13-week pilot project to integrate digital 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (dCBT) SM programs into routine psychiatric 
advanced practice nurse (APN) telehealth appointments in the rural United 
States. Eight participants completed the project. The project did not meet the 
benchmark of 20 participants to improve access to treatment; however, one half 
(n = 4) of participants reported clinically significant improvement in MDD 
symptoms over 6 weeks. For clients without access to psychotherapy, dCBT SM 
programs can be effective in improving individual client outcomes when 
implemented by APNs in routine telehealth appointments. [Journal of Psychosocial 
Nursing and Mental Health Services, 61(10), 44-51.].

BACKGROUND: Psychological online interventions (POIs) for depression have 
demonstrated promising effects. However, there are fewer randomized controlled 
studies on POIs among older adults with depression. The goal of the present 
study was to compare the use and efficacy of Deprexis, an online intervention 
for depression, among Millennials (18-35 years) and Baby Boomers (50-65 years).
METHODS: We completed a secondary data analysis on a subset (N = 577) of 
participants in the EVIDENT trial, a parallel-groups, pragmatic, randomized, 
controlled single-blind study, which compared a 12-week POI (Deprexis) to care 
as usual (CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (post-assessment) 
and 6 months (follow-up). The main outcome of interest was change on self-rated 
depression severity (PHQ-9).
RESULTS: Compared to Millennials, Boomers used the intervention significantly 
more often (d = 0.45) and for a longer duration (d = 0.46), and endorsed more 
positive attitudes towards POIs (d = 0.14). There was no significant Age Group 
by Intervention Group interaction for change in PHQ-9. The post-assessment 
between-group effect size (intervention vs. CAU control) for Millennials and 
Boomers were d = 0.26 and d = 0.39, respectively, and were stable at follow-up 
(d = 0.37 and d = 0.39).
LIMITATIONS: Age-based dichotomization may not accurately represent 
participants' experiences with and use of technology.
CONCLUSIONS: The POI examined in this trial was superior to CAU and was 
comparably effective among groups of adults defined as Millennials and Baby 
Boomers. Adults of the Baby Boomer generation who participate in POIs may have 
more positive attitudes towards POIs compared to their younger counterparts.

Disorder (LiveWell): Protocol Development for an Expert System to Provide

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness that results in 
significant morbidity and mortality. While pharmacotherapy is the primary 
treatment, adjunctive psychotherapy can improve outcomes. However, access to 
therapy is limited. Smartphones and other technologies can increase access to 
therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while simultaneously 
augmenting care by providing adaptive delivery of content to users as well as 
alerts to providers to facilitate clinical care communication. Unfortunately, 
while adaptive interventions are being developed and tested to improve care, 
information describing the components of adaptive interventions is often not 
published in sufficient detail to facilitate replication and improvement of 
these interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To contribute to and support the improvement and dissemination of 
technology-based mental health interventions, we provide a detailed description 
of the expert system for adaptively delivering content and facilitating clinical 
care communication for LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention 
for individuals with bipolar disorder.
METHODS: Information from empirically supported psychotherapies for bipolar 
disorder, health psychology behavior change theories, and chronic disease 
self-management models was combined with user-centered design data and 
psychiatrist feedback to guide the development of the expert system.
RESULTS: Decision points determining the timing of intervention option 
adaptation were selected to occur daily and weekly based on self-report data for 
medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and wellness levels. These data 
were selected for use as the tailoring variables determining which intervention 
options to deliver when and to whom. Decision rules linking delivery of options 
and tailoring variable thresholds were developed based on existing literature 
regarding bipolar disorder clinical status and psychiatrist feedback. To address 
the need for treatment adaptation with varying clinical statuses, decision rules 
for a clinical status state machine were developed using self-reported wellness 
rating data. Clinical status from this state machine was incorporated into 
hierarchal decision tables that select content for delivery to users and alerts 
to providers. The majority of the adaptive content addresses sleep duration, 
medication adherence, managing signs and symptoms, building and utilizing 
support, and keeping a regular routine, as well as determinants underlying 
engagement in these target behaviors as follows: attitudes and perceptions, 
knowledge, support, evaluation, and planning. However, when problems with early 
warning signs, symptoms, and transitions to more acute clinical states are 
detected, the decision rules shift the adaptive content to focus on managing 
signs and symptoms, and engaging with psychiatric providers.
CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive mental health technologies have the potential to enhance 
the self-management of mental health disorders. The need for individuals with 
bipolar disorder to engage in the management of multiple target behaviors and to 
address changes in clinical status highlights the importance of detailed 
reporting of adaptive intervention components to allow replication and 
improvement of adaptive mental health technologies for complex mental health

BACKGROUND: While there is evolving knowledge on change processes of digital 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of depression, little is 
known about how these interventions produce therapeutic change in the comorbid 
constellation of chronic back pain (CBP). Here, we examined whether the effects 
of a digital intervention to treat depression in patients with CBP are mediated 
by three pain-related variables (i.e., pain self-efficacy, pain-related 
disability, pain intensity).
METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial 
conducted in routine care at 82 orthopedic clinics across Germany. In total, 209 
adults with CBP and diagnosed depression (SCID interview) were randomly assigned 
to the intervention (n = 104) or treatment-as-usual (n = 105). Cross-lagged 
mediation models were estimated to investigate longitudinal mediation effects of 
putative mediators with depression symptom severity (PHQ-9) as primary outcome 
at post-treatment.
RESULTS: Longitudinal mediation effects were observed for pain self-efficacy 
(ß = -0.094, 95%-CI [-0.174, -0.014], p = 0.021) and pain-related disability 
(ß = -0.068, 95%-CI [-0.130, -0.001], p = 0.047). Furthermore, the hypothesized 
direction of the mediation effects was supported, reversed causation did not 
occur. Pain intensity did not reveal a mediation effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a relevant role of pain self-efficacy and 
pain-related disability as change processes in the treatment of depression for 
patients with CBP in routine care. However, further research is needed to 
disclose potential reciprocal relationships of mediators, and to extend and 
specify our knowledge of the mechanisms of change in digital CBT for depression.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health 
priority. Strategies targeting individuals at elevated risk for MDD may guide 
effective preventive care. Insomnia is a reliable precursor to depression, 
preceding half of all incident and relapse cases. Thus, insomnia may serve as a 
useful entry point for preventing MDD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia, but widespread 
implementation is limited by a shortage of trained specialists. Innovative 
stepped-care approaches rooted in primary care can increase access to CBT-I and 
reduce rates of MDD.
METHODS/DESIGN: We propose a large-scale stepped-care clinical trial in the 
primary care setting that utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized 
trial (SMART) design to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in 
combination with clinician-led CBT-I for insomnia and the prevention of MDD 
incidence and relapse. Specifically, our care model uses digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) 
as a first-line intervention to increase care access and reduce the need for 
specialist resources. Our proposal also adds clinician-led CBT-I for patients 
who do not remit with first-line intervention and need a more personalized 
approach from specialty care. We will evaluate negative repetitive thinking as a 
potential treatment mechanism by which dCBT-I and CBT-I benefit insomnia and 
depression outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a 
large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination and 
implementation to address the high volume of population need for safe and 
effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression.

BACKGROUND: Patients who present to emergency departments after intentional 
self-harm are at an increased risk of dying by suicide. This applies 
particularly to men, who represent nearly two-thirds of those who die by suicide 
in Ontario. One way of potentially addressing this gap is to offer a course of 
blended problem-solving therapy, comprised of a brief course of evidence-based 
psychotherapy for individuals at risk for suicide, facilitated by the use of a 
patient-facing smartphone application and a clinician-facing "dashboard." This 
approach has the potential to combine the benefits of face-to-face therapy and 
technology to create a novel intervention.
METHODS: This is a cohort study nested within a larger pragmatic multicentre 
pre- and post-design cluster randomised trial. Suicidal ideation assessed by the 
Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation is the primary outcome variable. Secondary 
outcome measures include depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety 
(Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale), post-traumatic stress disorder 
(Primary Care PTSD Screen), health-related quality of life (EuroQol 5-dimension 
5-level questionnaire), meaning in life (Experienced Meaning in Life Scale), 
perceived social supports (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), 
alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), drug use (Drug Abuse 
Screening Test Short Form 10), problem-solving skills (Social Problem-Solving 
Inventory-Revised Short Form), and self-reported healthcare costs, as well as 
health service use measured using Ontario administrative health data. A process 
evaluation will also be conducted following study completion.
DISCUSSION: The cohort study will test whether better adherence to the 
intervention results in better outcomes. The value of the cohort study design is 
that we can examine in more detail certain subgroups or other variables that are 
not available in the larger cluster randomised trial. This trial will aim to 
improve standards by informing best practice in management of men who self-harm 
and present to hospitals in Ontario.

BACKGROUND: Psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 
currently have the strongest evidence of durable symptom changes for most 
psychological disorders, such as anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, only about 
half of individuals treated with CBT benefit from it. Predictive algorithms, 
including digital assessments and passive sensing features, could better 
identify patients who would benefit from CBT, and thus, improve treatment 
choices.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish predictive features that forecast 
responses to transdiagnostic CBT in anxiety disorders and to investigate key 
mechanisms underlying treatment responses.
METHODS: This study is a 2-armed randomized controlled clinical trial. We 
include patients with anxiety disorders who are randomized to either a 
transdiagnostic CBT group or a waitlist (referred to as WAIT). We index key 
features to predict responses prior to starting treatment using subjective 
self-report questionnaires, experimental tasks, biological samples, ecological 
momentary assessments, activity tracking, and smartphone-based passive sensing 
to derive a multimodal feature set for predictive modeling. Additional 
assessments take place weekly at mid- and posttreatment and at 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups to index anxiety and depression symptom severity. We aim to include 
150 patients, randomized to CBT versus WAIT at a 3:1 ratio. The data set will be 
subject to full feature and important features selected by minimal redundancy 
and maximal relevance feature selection and then fed into machine leaning 
models, including eXtreme gradient boosting, pattern recognition network, and 
k-nearest neighbors to forecast treatment response. The performance of the 
developed models will be evaluated. In addition to predictive modeling, we will 
test specific mechanistic hypotheses (eg, association between self-efficacy, 
daily symptoms obtained using ecological momentary assessments, and treatment 
response) to elucidate mechanisms underlying treatment response.
RESULTS: The trial is now completed. It was approved by the Cantonal Ethics 
Committee, Zurich. The results will be disseminated through publications in 
scientific peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.
CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this trial is to improve current CBT treatment by 
precise forecasting of treatment response and by understanding and potentially 
augmenting underpinning mechanisms and personalizing treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this narrative review is to collect and analyze 
research on selected methods of preventing postpartum depression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature review for this work was carried out in the 
scientific database PubMed. The analysis and further description were developed 
based on the PRISMA protocol. Only English-language research, published between 
2018 and 2023 were included.
RESULTS: Research has not definitively proved a correlation between physical 
activity and preventing postpartum depression. The effective strategies that may 
reduce the risk of postpartum depression include mindfulness meditation, 
providing pregnant women with social support and professional medical care, as 
well as participating in educational programs during pregnancy. Additionally, 
internet programs and mobile apps based on cognitive-behavioral therapy can be 
an effective form of psychological support for pregnant women.
CONCLUSIONS: There are a few effective strategies that may reduce the risk of 
postpartum depression. The research has shown that the key is to provide women 
with holistic and multidisciplinary care, as well as identifying groups at 
highest risk of postpartum depression, in order to offer them professional 
support as quickly as possible.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of perinatal depression beginning from the antenatal 
period is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the 
effectiveness of recently developed internet-delivered cognitive behavioral 
therapy (iCBT) for preventing the onset of a major depressive episode (MDE) in 
the third trimester and at 3 months postpartum.
METHODS: This is a two-arm, parallel-group, general-information controlled, 
randomized controlled trial. Participants were 5017 pregnant women at 
16-20 weeks' gestation without MDE at baseline. They were randomly assigned to 
an iCBT (intervention; n = 2509) or general-information (control; n = 2508) 
group, stratified by psychological distress at baseline. The primary outcomes 
were the numbers of new MDE onsets, measured using the World Health Organization 
Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0, at 32 weeks' gestation and at 
3 months postpartum.
RESULTS: New MDE onset was reported by 59 participants (2.35%) in the 
intervention group and 73 (2.91%) in the control group during follow-up. 
Compared with the control group, the hazard ratio (HR) of MDE in the 
intervention group was 0.85 (95% CI 0.61-1.20), which was not significantly 
different. Among participants who scored between 5 and 8 on K6 at baseline, 10 
(1.37%) in the intervention group reported new onset of MDE, compared with 28 
(3.81%) in the control group, and the HR of MDE was 0.38 (95%CI 0.19-0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: No intervention effect was found for iCBT in preventing new onset 
of perinatal MDE. iCBT might prevent perinatal depression only among pregnant 
women with subthreshold depressive symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum anxiety and depression are common in new parents. While 
effective interventions exist, they are often delivered in person, which can be 
a barrier for some parents seeking help. One approach to overcoming these 
barriers is the delivery of evidence-based self-help interventions via websites, 
smartphone apps, and other digital media.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based 
distal interventions in reducing or preventing symptoms of postpartum depression 
or anxiety in male and female birth and adoptive parents, explore the 
effectiveness of technology-based distal interventions in increasing social 
ties, and determine the level of adherence to and satisfaction with 
technology-based distal interventions.
METHODS: A systematic review and series of meta-analyses were conducted. Three 
electronic bibliographic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were 
searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating technology-based distal 
interventions for postpartum depression or anxiety in birth and adoptive 
parents. Searches were updated on August 1, 2023, before conducting the final 
meta-analyses. Data on trial characteristics, effectiveness, adherence, 
satisfaction, and quality were extracted. Screening and data extraction were 
conducted by 2 reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs 
Institute quality rating scale for randomized controlled trials. Studies were 
initially synthesized qualitatively. Where possible, studies were also 
quantitatively synthesized through 5 meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Overall, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic 
review, with 14 (78%) providing sufficient data for a meta-analysis. A small 
significant between-group effect on depression favored the intervention 
conditions at the postintervention (Cohen d=-0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; 
P<.001) and follow-up (Cohen d=-0.27, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.02; P=.03) time points. 
A small significant effect on anxiety also favored the intervention conditions 
at the postintervention time point (Cohen d=-0.29, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.10; 
P=.002), with a medium effect at follow-up (Cohen d=-0.47, 95% CI -0.88 to 
-0.05; P=.03). The effect on social ties was not significant at the 
postintervention time point (Cohen d=0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.21; P=.61). 
Effective interventions tended to be web-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
programs with reminders. Adherence varied considerably between studies, whereas 
satisfaction tended to be high for most studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Technology-based distal interventions are effective in reducing 
symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety in birth mothers. Key limitations 
of the reviewed evidence include heterogeneity in outcome measures, studies 
being underpowered to detect modest effects, and the exclusion of key 
populations from the evidence base. More research needs to be conducted with 
birth fathers and adoptive parents to better ascertain the effectiveness of 
interventions in these populations, as well as to further assess the effect of 
technology-based distal interventions on social ties.

BACKGROUND: The ubiquitous nature of mobile phones and their increasing 
functionality make them an ideal medium for the delivery of large-scale public 
health information and interventions. While mobile phones have been used to this 
end in behavioural and physical health settings, their role in monitoring and 
managing mental health is in its infancy.
AIMS: The purpose of this paper is (1) to provide an overview of the field of 
mobile mental health and (2) by way of illustration, describe an initial proof 
of concept study carried out to assess the potential utility and effectiveness 
of a newly developed mobile phone and web-based program in the management of 
mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety and depression.
METHODS: Over 6 weeks, participants were given access to "myCompass": an 
interactive self-help program, which includes real-time self-monitoring with 
short message service prompts and brief online modules grounded in cognitive 
behavioural therapy.
RESULTS: Preliminary analyses found that participants' symptoms of stress, 
anxiety, depression and overall psychological distress were significantly 
reduced after using myCompass. Improvements were also found in functional 
impairment and self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the feasibility of implementing 
mobile phone-based interventions with the potential of improving psychological 
wellbeing.

BACKGROUND: Misuse of substances is common, can be serious and costly to 
society, and often goes untreated due to barriers to accessing care. Woebot is a 
mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and 
built upon an artificial intelligence-driven platform to deliver tailored 
content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot 
alleviated depressive symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use 
disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary 
efficacy.
METHODS: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance 
misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources 
and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group 
pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided 
mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and 
psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and 
motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric 
tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on 
measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain.
RESULTS: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% 
(76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic 
White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants' W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 
(SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 
94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. 
From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half 
(87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 
0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better 
retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From 
pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances 
significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past 
month substance use occasions (mean change -9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on 
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change -1.3, SD 2.6; 
P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change -1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), 
Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change -2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings 
scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most 
participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported 
receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or 
all of their needs (22/51, 43%).
CONCLUSIONS: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was 
associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, 
depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate 
W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the 
use of greater study retention strategies.

BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutics, such as interventions provided via smartphones 
or the internet, have been proposed as promising solutions to support 
self-management in persons with chronic conditions. However, the evidence 
supporting self-management interventions through technology in stroke is scarce, 
and the intervention development processes are often not well described, 
creating challenges in explaining why and how the intervention would work.
OBJECTIVE: This study describes a specific use case of using intervention 
mapping (IM) and the taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in designing 
a digital intervention to manage chronic symptoms and support daily life 
participation in people after stroke. IM is an implementation science framework 
used to bridge the gap between theories and practice to ensure that the 
intervention can be implemented in real-world settings. The taxonomy of BCTs 
consists of a set of active ingredients designed to change self-management 
behaviors.
METHODS: We used the first 4 steps of the IM process to develop a 
technology-supported self-management intervention, interactive Self-Management 
Augmented by Rehabilitation Technologies (iSMART), adapted from a face-to-face 
stroke-focused psychoeducation program. Planning group members were involved in 
adapting the intervention. They also completed 3 implementation measures to 
assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of iSMART.
RESULTS: In step 1, we completed a needs assessment consisting of assembling a 
planning group to codevelop the intervention, conducting telephone surveys of 
people after stroke (n=125) to identify service needs, and performing a 
systematic review of randomized controlled trials to examine evidence of the 
effectiveness of digital self-management interventions to improve patient 
outcomes. We identified activity scheduling, symptom management, stroke 
prevention, access to care resources, and cognitive enhancement training as key 
service needs after a stroke. The review suggested that digital self-management 
interventions, especially those using cognitive behavioral theory, effectively 
reduce depression, anxiety, and fatigue and enhance self-efficacy in 
neurological disorders. Step 2 identified key determinants, objectives, and 
strategies for self-management in iSMART, including knowledge, behavioral 
regulation, skills, self-efficacy, motivation, negative and positive affect, and 
social and environmental support. In step 3, we generated the intervention 
components underpinned by appropriate BCTs. In step 4, we developed iSMART with 
the planning group members. Especially, iSMART simplified the original 
psychoeducation program and added 2 new components: SMS text messaging and 
behavioral coaching, intending to increase the uptake by people after stroke. 
iSMART was found to be acceptable (mean score 4.63, SD 0.38 out of 5), 
appropriate (mean score 4.63, SD 0.38 out of 5), and feasible (mean score 4.58, 
SD 0.34 out of 5).
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a detailed example of using IM and the taxonomy of BCTs 
for designing and developing a digital intervention to support people after 
stroke in managing chronic symptoms and maintaining active participation in 
daily life.

The present meta-analysis investigated the overall and differential efficacy of 
digital cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) vs. third-generation CBTs deployed 
to pregnant women in reducing sub-clinical depression, anxiety, and stress 
symptoms while fostering sleep quality and quality of life. A PRISMA-guided 
systematic search was used, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
evaluating the above-mentioned interventions. Data were pooled using either the 
mean difference (MD) or standardized MD (SMD). Sub-group analyses were carried 
out when appropriate. The primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress 
symptoms, as well as sleep quality and quality of life. The interventions' 
acceptability was evaluated through the odds ratio (OR) of drop-out rates. Seven 
RCTs were included, comprising 1873 pregnant women. The results showed the 
interventions' efficacy in terms of reducing depression symptoms (SMD = -0.36, 
CI = 0.61, -0.11, k = 9) at the endpoint, although it was not maintained at 
follow-up during the postpartum period. The interventions' efficacy in terms of 
reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD = 1.96, CI = -2.72, -1.21, k = 3) at the endpoint 
was also significant, while having no effect on sleep quality. The interventions 
were well accepted (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = 0.84, 3.35; k = 7). Although no sound 
conclusions can be drawn concerning the joint or differential efficacy of the 
considered interventions, this study was useful in highlighting the need to 
develop evidence-based digital prevention programs for pregnant women with 
sub-clinical symptoms.

BACKGROUND: There is often a waiting period for people who seek psychiatric 
treatment for depression or anxiety. As this delay risks worsening symptoms, an 
alternative could be to provide an intervention that requires minimal resources 
during the waiting period.
AIMS: The aim was to investigate if a digital problem-solving intervention 
delivered in a self-guided format with automated features is feasible to provide 
for patients on the waiting list in routine psychiatric care.
METHOD: A total of 12 patients with symptoms of depression or anxiety on the 
waiting list for treatment in routine psychiatric care were given access to a 
self-guided and monitored digital problem-solving intervention over 4 weeks. 
Primary outcome measures were treatment credibility and usability. Secondary 
outcome measures were behavioural engagement, symptoms of depression and 
anxiety, and negative effects.
RESULTS: A majority of participants rated the intervention as both credible and 
usable. The intervention was used at least once by nine out of 12 individuals, 
with an average of 11 logins. The participants did, on average, initiate 2.8 
problem-solving attempts and 10.1 solutions. A few participants reached a 
clinically relevant symptom improvement of depression and anxiety. No serious 
negative effects were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The credibility and usability of the intervention was perceived as 
good, and the behavioural engagement with the intervention was deemed sufficient 
compared with similar self-guided interventions. A self-guided and monitored 
digital problem-solving intervention may be a beneficial option for patients 
waiting for or receiving treatment in routine psychiatric care, and should be 
further evaluated.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a rare stressor that has precipitated an accompanying 
mental health crisis. Prospective studies traversing the pandemic's onset can 
elucidate how pre-existing disease vulnerabilities augured risk for later 
stress-related morbidity. We examined how pre-pandemic sleep reactivity 
predicted maladaptive stress reactions and depressive symptoms in response to, 
and during, the pandemic. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomised 
controlled trial from 2016 to 2017 comparing digital cognitive behavioural 
therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) against sleep education (N = 208). Thus, we also 
assessed whether dCBT-I moderated the association between pre-pandemic sleep 
reactivity and pandemic-related distress. Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity was 
measured at baseline using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test. In April 
2020, participants were recontacted to report pandemic-related distress (stress 
reactions and depression). Controlling for the treatment condition and the 
degree of COVID-19 impact, higher pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted more 
stress reactions (β = 0.13, ± 0.07 SE, p = 0.045) and depression (β = 0.22, 
± 0.07 SE, p = 0.001) during the pandemic. Further, the odds of reporting 
clinically significant stress reactions and depression during the pandemic were 
over twice as high in those with high pre-pandemic sleep reactivity. Notably, 
receiving dCBT-I in 2016-2017 mitigated the relationship between pre-pandemic 
sleep reactivity and later stress reactions (but not depression). Pre-pandemic 
sleep reactivity predicted psychological distress 3-4 years later during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and dCBT-I attenuated its association with stress reactions, 
specifically. Sleep reactivity may inform prevention and treatment efforts by 
identifying individuals at risk of impairment following stressful events.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are leading causes of disability worldwide. 
Though effective treatments exist, depression and anxiety remain undertreated. 
Blended care psychotherapy, combining the scalability of online interventions 
with the personalization and engagement of a live therapist, is a promising 
approach for increasing access to evidence-based care.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and individual contribution of two 
components - i) digital tools and ii) video-based therapist-led sessions - in a 
blended care CBT-based intervention under real world conditions.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to analyze N = 1372 US-based 
individuals who enrolled in blended care psychotherapy. Of these, at baseline, 
761 participants had depression symptoms in the clinical range (based on PHQ-9), 
and 1254 had anxiety symptoms in the clinical range (based on GAD-7). 
Participants had access to the program as a mental health benefit offered by 
their employer. The CBT-based blended care psychotherapy program consisted of 
regular video sessions with therapists, complemented by digital lessons and 
digital exercises assigned by the clinician and completed in between sessions. 
Depression and anxiety levels and clients' treatment engagement were tracked 
throughout treatment. A 3-level individual growth curve model incorporating 
time-varying covariates was utilized to examine symptom trajectories of PHQ-9 
scores (for those with clinical range of depression at baseline) and GAD-7 
scores (for those with clinical range of anxiety at baseline).
RESULTS: On average, individuals exhibited a significant decline in depression 
and anxiety symptoms during the initial weeks of treatment (P < .001), and a 
continued decline over subsequent weeks at a slower rate (P < .001). Engaging in 
a therapy session in a week was associated with lower GAD-7 (b = -0.81) and 
PHQ-9 (b = -1.01) scores in the same week, as well as lower GAD-7 (b = -0.58) 
and PHQ-9 (b = -0.58) scores the following week (all P < .01). Similarly, 
engaging with digital lessons was independently associated with lower GAD-7 
(b = -0.19) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.18) scores during the same week, and lower GAD-7 
(b = -0.25) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.27) the following week (all P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Therapist-led video sessions and digital lessons had separate 
contributions to improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety over the 
course of treatment. Future research should investigate whether clients' 
characteristics are related to differential effects of therapist-led and digital 
components of care.

Trials.

BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions can 
effectively prevent and treat depression and anxiety, but engagement with these 
programs is often low. Although extensive research has evaluated program use as 
a proxy for engagement, the extent to which users acquire knowledge and enact 
skills from these programs has been largely overlooked.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how skill enactment and knowledge 
acquisition have been measured, evaluate postintervention changes in skill 
enactment and knowledge acquisition, examine whether mental health outcomes are 
associated with skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and evaluate 
predictors of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition.
METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2022. We 
included RCTs comparing digital CBT with any comparison group in adolescents or 
adults (aged ≥12 years) for anxiety or depression. Eligible studies reported 
quantitative measures of skill enactment or knowledge acquisition. The 
methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs 
Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs. Narrative synthesis was used to 
address the review questions.
RESULTS: In total, 43 papers were included, of which 29 (67%) reported a skill 
enactment measure and 15 (35%) reported a knowledge acquisition measure. Skill 
enactment was typically operationalized as the frequency of enacting skills 
using the completion of in-program activities (ie, formal skill enactment; 
13/29, 45%) and intervention-specific (9/29, 31%) or standardized (8/29, 28%) 
questionnaires. Knowledge measures included tests of CBT knowledge (6/15, 40%) 
or mental health literacy (5/15, 33%) and self-report questionnaires (6/15, 
40%). In total, 17 studies evaluated postintervention changes in skill enactment 
or knowledge acquisition, and findings were mostly significant for skill 
enactment (6/8, 75% of the studies), CBT knowledge (6/6, 100%), and mental 
health literacy (4/5, 80%). Of the 12 studies that evaluated the association 
between skill enactment and postintervention mental health outcomes, most 
reported ≥1 significant positive finding on standardized questionnaires (4/4, 
100%), formal skill enactment indicators (5/7, 71%), or intervention-specific 
questionnaires (1/1, 100%). None of the 4 studies that evaluated the association 
between knowledge acquisition and primary mental health outcomes reported 
significant results. A total of 13 studies investigated predictors of skill 
enactment; only type of guidance and improvements in psychological variables 
were associated with increased skill enactment in ≥2 analyses. Predictors of 
knowledge acquisition were evaluated in 2 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBT for depression and anxiety can improve skill enactment 
and knowledge acquisition. However, only skill enactment appears to be 
associated with mental health outcomes, which may depend on the type of measure 
examined. Additional research is needed to understand what types and levels of 
skill enactment and knowledge acquisition are most relevant for outcomes and 
identify predictors of these constructs.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has confirmed that symptoms of postnatal 
depression (PND) can be ameliorated through internet-delivered psychological 
interventions. Advantages of internet-delivered treatment include anonymity, 
convenience, and catering to women who are unable to access face-to-face (FTF) 
treatments. To date, no research has examined the efficacy of such interventions 
compared directly with FTF treatments in women clinically diagnosed with PND.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the efficacy of one of the first web-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions (internet CBT+coach calls) for 
PND (MumMoodBooster [MMB]) with FTF-CBT in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: In this study, 116 postnatal women with a Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of major or minor 
depression were randomized to MMB (39/116, 33.6%), FTF-CBT (39/116, 33.6%), or a 
treatment-as-usual (TAU) control condition (38/116, 32.8%). Diagnostic status 
was determined at baseline and at 21-week follow-up using the Structured 
Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms 
was evaluated using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the revised Beck 
Depression Inventory at baseline, 12-week follow-up (after treatment), and 
21-week follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 116 participants, 107 (92.2%) had a diagnosis of major 
depression at baseline. Rates of remission from a major or minor depressive 
episode at 21 weeks in both the FTF-CBT and MMB groups were superior to that of 
the TAU group (56.6% and 47.7% less likely to be depressed, respectively) and 
they were not significantly different from each other. Although remission rates 
differed between TAU and FTF-CBT, growth models showed that, in terms of symptom 
reduction across time, the FTF-CBT treatment was not significantly better than 
TAU. By comparison, MMB was statistically superior to both TAU and FTF-CBT in 
reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress from baseline to the 
21-week follow-up (large and moderate effect sizes). Thus, after 21 weeks, the 
average symptom scores for depression and anxiety of women receiving MMB were 
approximately half those of women in both the TAU and FTF-CBT groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this RCT, MMB was at least as effective as FTF-CBT in achieving 
remission from a diagnosed PND episode. MMB was superior to TAU and FTF-CBT in 
encouraging and maintaining reduction of symptom severity over the 21-week 
follow-up for depressed postnatal women. These findings replicate results of 
prior studies on MMB that showed clinically significant improvements in 
depressive symptoms, and they provide direct empirical support that 
internet-delivered treatment for depressed postnatal women is a viable 
alternative to FTF treatment. The generalizability of the results needs to be 
examined in future research, as RCTs of internet-based versus FTF treatments 
necessarily involve a subset of people who are willing to undertake either 
modality of treatment.

BACKGROUND: Globally, most individuals who are susceptible to depression do not 
receive adequate or timely treatment. Unguided computerized cognitive behavioral 
therapy (cCBT) has the potential to bridge this treatment gap. However, the 
real-world effectiveness of unguided cCBT interventions, particularly in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs), remains inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to report the design and development of a new 
unguided cCBT-based multicomponent intervention, TreadWill, and its pragmatic 
evaluation. TreadWill was designed to be fully automated, engaging, easy to use, 
and accessible to LMICs.
METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of TreadWill and the engagement level, we 
performed a double-blind, fully remote, and randomized controlled trial with 598 
participants in India and analyzed the data using a completer's analysis.
RESULTS: The users who completed at least half of the modules in TreadWill 
showed significant reduction in depression-related (P=.04) and anxiety-related 
(P=.02) symptoms compared with the waitlist control. Compared with a plain-text 
version with the same therapeutic content, the full-featured version of 
TreadWill showed significantly higher engagement (P=.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a new resource and evidence for the use of 
unguided cCBT as a scalable intervention in LMICs.

Digital health technologies offer unique opportunities to improve health 
outcomes for mental health conditions such as peripartum depression (PPD), a 
disorder that affects approximately 10-15% of women in the U.S. every year. In 
this paper, we present the adaption of a digital technology development 
framework, Digilego, in the context of PPD. Methods include mapping of the 
Behavior Intervention Technology (BIT) model and the Patient Engagement 
Framework (PEF) to translate patient needs captured through focus groups. This 
informs formative development and implementation of digital health features for 
optimal patient engagement in PPD screening and management. Results show an 
array ofPPD-specific Digilego blocks ("My Diary", "Mom Talk", "My Care", 
"Library", "How am I doing today?"). Initial evaluation results from comparative 
market analysis indicate that our proposed platform offers advantageous 
technology aspects. Limitations and future work in areas of interdisciplinary 
care coordination and patient engagement optimization are discussed.

Depression and anxiety disorders are prevalent mental health conditions; yet 
they are often unrecognized, under-addressed and/or under-treated, and specialty 
treatment for these conditions is oftentimes difficult to access. By acting 
either as a bridge to therapy or as a form of therapy, digital tools, such as 
those that provide internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), may help 
clinicians support their patients' mental health needs. At one academic health 
system, a digital mental health program was deployed in primary care and 
outpatient behavioral health programs to help patients meet needs identified 
through screening or clinical visits. Over the first two years of operation, 138 
clinicians (40% of eligible clinicians) prescribed the program to 2,228 unique 
patients, from which 1,117 (48.9%) enrolled. Patients who enrolled tended to be 
younger and healthier than non-enrollees. On average, enrolled patients spent 
114.6 minutes within the iCBT program. Clinical improvement was assessed using 
pre- and post PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores for depression and anxiety, respectively. 
Pre/Post scores were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Patients with at 
least moderate depression had an average 23% reduction in PHQ-9 scores (median 
change -3(interquartile range 7), p<0.001) and those with at least moderate 
anxiety had a 26% reduction in GAD-7 scores (-4(7), p<0.001). Improvements were 
clinically and statistically significant. Future steps include performing a cost 
analysis to understand whether models utilizing iCBT are net cost-saving for 
health systems.

Adolescent depression is common, and its prevalence is thought to be increasing 
in many high income nations. Addressing adolescent depression has proven 
challenging using traditional face-to-face psychotherapies, with major barriers 
including workforce shortages internationally and reluctance to seek help among 
some adolescents. There is substantial evidence to support the use of digital 
tools to treat mental health problems, with the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) now recommending such tools as a first-line 
treatment. In this article, we outline the evidence base for SPARX, a digital 
tool named specifically in NICE guideline NG134, and discuss its use in clinical 
settings. We also consider implementation issues and future research directions.

BACKGROUND: Social distancing and stay-at-home orders are critical interventions 
to slow down person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. While these societal 
changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative 
consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily 
skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19-related depression 
and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United 
States.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants' anxiety 
and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text 
messages.
METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based 
questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of 
StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health 
Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used 
2-tailed paired t tests to detect changes in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from 
baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later.
RESULTS: The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the 
baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were 
significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an 
average reduction of -1.72 (95% CI -2.35 to -1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and -0.48 
(95% CI -0.71 to -0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 
18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental 
health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health 
coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In 
addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during 
the 60-day intervention period. Text messaging interventions could serve as an 
important public health tool for disseminating strategies to manage mental 
health.

Depressive disorders are an enormous societal burden given their high prevalence 
and impact on all facets of being human (e.g., relationships, emotions, 
motivation). There is a variety of evidence-based psychological treatments, with 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) being the gold standard for major depression. 
Research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) are an effective relapse prevention 
and treatment for depression and that MBIs can be integrated in individual 
therapy. Furthermore, various delivery modes (e.g., digital-delivered therapy) 
and settings are offered to best meet different needs and improve accessibility: 
Evidence suggests that therapist-guided digital CBT, blended therapy, and, to 
some degree, digitalized MBIs may be an efficacious supplement to traditional 
face-to-face therapy. This chapter provides an overview of the principles and 
evidence base for CBT and MBCT as well as different delivery modes for 
depressive disorders in adults. Finally, chances and challenges of integration 
are discussed as implications for practice, as well as recommendations and ideas 
for future research.

BACKGROUND: Developing effective, widely useful, weight management programs is a 
priority in health care because obesity is a major health problem.
OBJECTIVE: This study developed and investigated a new, comprehensive, 
multifactorial, daily, intensive, psychologist coaching program based on 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules. The program was delivered via the 
digital health care mobile services Noom Coach and InBody.
METHODS: This was an open-label, active-comparator, randomized controlled trial. 
A total of 70 female participants with BMI scores above 24 kg/m2 and no clinical 
problems besides obesity were randomized into experimental and control groups. 
The experimental (ie, digital CBT) group (n=45) was connected with a therapist 
intervention using a digital health care service that provided daily feedback 
and assignments for 8 weeks. The control group (n=25) also used the digital 
health care service, but practiced self-care without therapist intervention. The 
main outcomes of this study were measured objectively at baseline, 8 weeks, and 
24 weeks and included weight (kg) as well as other body compositions. 
Differences between groups were evaluated using independent t tests and a 
per-protocol framework.
RESULTS: Mean weight loss at 8 weeks in the digital CBT group was significantly 
higher than in the control group (-3.1%, SD 4.5, vs -0.7%, SD 3.4, P=.04). 
Additionally, the proportion of subjects who attained conventional 5% weight 
loss from baseline in the digital CBT group was significantly higher than in the 
control group at 8 weeks (32% [12/38] vs 4% [1/21], P=.02) but not at 24 weeks. 
Mean fat mass reduction in the digital CBT group at 8 weeks was also 
significantly greater than in the control group (-6.3%, SD 8.8, vs -0.8%, SD 
8.1, P=.02). Mean leptin and insulin resistance in the digital CBT group at 8 
weeks was significantly reduced compared to the control group (-15.8%, SD 29.9, 
vs 7.2%, SD 35.9, P=.01; and -7.1%, SD 35.1, vs 14.4%, SD 41.2, P=.04). 
Emotional eating behavior (ie, mean score) measured by questionnaire (ie, the 
Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) at 8 weeks was significantly improved 
compared to the control group (-2.8%, SD 34.4, vs 21.6%, SD 56.9, P=.048). Mean 
snack calorie intake in the digital CBT group during the intervention period was 
significantly lower than in the control group (135.9 kcal, SD 86.4, vs 208.2 
kcal, SD 166.3, P=.02). Lastly, baseline depression, anxiety, and self-esteem 
levels significantly predicted long-term clinical outcomes (24 weeks), while 
baseline motivation significantly predicted both short-term (8 weeks) and 
long-term clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that technology-based interventions should 
be multidimensional and are most effective with human feedback and support. This 
study is innovative in successfully developing and verifying the effects of a 
new CBT approach with a multidisciplinary team based on digital technologies 
rather than standalone technology-based interventions.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: Sleep problems are common among those with 
depression, and there is increasing evidence that sleep problems should be 
addressed during treatment simultaneously rather than treating depression alone. 
The first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-I), due to a lack of well-trained therapists and patient time 
constraints (travelling, work), CBT-I has not been popularized. The development 
of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is making the 
treatment more accessible.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: Interventions for dCBT-I were 
significantly better than other control conditions in both reducing insomnia and 
improving depression in patients with depression and insomnia comorbidities. The 
effect was found to be related to the duration of the intervention and the 
severity of insomnia before the intervention and therapist-involved dCBT-I has 
less shedding than self-help.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It's important for mental health 
practitioners to realize that insomnia in depressed people needs to be treated. 
Future trials may explore the effectiveness of therapist-guided dCBT-I in 
depressed populations and analyse the cost-effectiveness of this treatment.
ABSTRACT: Aim The aim of the study was to systematically identify and synthesize 
the evidence for the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in 
insomnia with comorbid depression. Design Systematic review and metaanalysis. 
Methods A search was conducted on five English and four non-English databases 
from the inception of the databases to November 2023. This review adhered to the 
recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-analysis Statement 2020 and the included studies were evaluated using 
version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This review examined sleep-related 
outcomes, including insomnia severity and sleep diaries, along with 
psychological outcomes, such as depression. We conducted a meta-analysis of each 
outcome using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 
statistic. Results A total of seven articles with 1864 participants were 
included in this review. The results showed that the digital cognitive 
behavioural therapy group demonstrated a statistically significant amelioration 
in the severity of insomnia symptoms, as well as a reduction in depressive 
symptomatology compared with the control groups. The post-intervention effect 
was found to be related to the duration of the intervention and the severity of 
insomnia before the intervention. Conclusions Digital cognitive behavioural 
therapy for insomnia application in patients with depression and insomnia was 
demonstrated to be effective, less time-consuming and more accessible. Relevance 
to Clinical Practice We may consider incorporating nurses into treatment plans 
and conducting nurse-led interventions in specific programs. In the future, 
nurses may be able to provide exclusive digital behavioural therapy for insomnia 
to patients with depression to achieve greater effectiveness.

Patients in regional, rural and remote communities experience perennial 
difficulties accessing mental health treatments in a timely manner, which 
contributes to inequitable outcomes when compared with their metropolitan 
counterparts. This situation frequently stems from a shortage of specialised 
face-to-face psychotherapy services available in local areas. The recent 
development of digital psychotherapy as an alternative treatment delivery method 
provides an opportunity to address this healthcare gap and to avoid the 
challenges related to workforce maldistribution. This article provides a 
targeted narrative review of the relevant evidence base, and discusses the 
potential applications within the rural and remote context. Multiple randomised 
controlled trials and a large meta-analysis demonstrate that digital 
psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy, is as effective as 
face-to-face psychotherapy. Its use has consequently been endorsed across 
international clinical practice guidelines as an efficacious and practical way 
to provide mental healthcare. Despite this, the adoption of digital 
psychotherapeutic options has been limited to date. Increased awareness of the 
available options may improve access to psychological treatments in rural and 
remote populations. Digital psychotherapy should be considered an option for 
patients with depressive or anxiety disorders of mild-to-moderate severity.

Quality sleep is among the most important determinants of psychological and 
physical well-being. Insufficient sleep quality and quantity directly affect 
individuals; in turn, they indirectly affect the productivity, viability and 
safety of workplaces. Sleep issues also represent a global health concern for 
people and workplaces around the world. In addition to pharmaceutical aids, 
effective and accessible interventions need to address the underlying problems, 
as might be achieved by behavioural therapies or structured, cognitive 
interventions like mindfulness-based programs. The time intensity and relatively 
high costs of such tactics has limited their widespread adoption though. With a 
sample of 606 full-time working adults, the current study tests the potential 
effectiveness of a short, inexpensive, app-based, self-help mindfulness 
meditation programme for promoting sleep quality and quantity. Using a 
longitudinal randomised experimental design, the authors compared the utility of 
a 10-day mindfulness programme with a passive control group, as well as with an 
active control group that engaged in 10 days of mind-wandering exercises. Sleep 
benefits emerged immediately after the 10-day intervention but seemingly wore 
off about three months later. Acknowledging the interactions between sleep, 
depression and anxiety, we also measured the two latter variables. We also find 
that the intervention was effective on depression, but not on anxiety. These 
insights offer implications for both research and practice.

INTRODUCTION: Pregnant and postpartum women face major psychological stressors 
that put them at higher risk of developing common mental disorders, such as 
depression and anxiety. Yet, their limited access to and uptake of traditional 
mental health care is inequitable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Mobile interventions emerged as a potential solution to this discontinued 
healthcare access, but more knowledge is needed about their effectiveness and 
impact on health equity. This equity-focused systematic review examined the 
effectiveness and equity impact of mobile interventions targeting common mental 
disorders among pregnant and postpartum women.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and 3 
other databases, from date of database inception and until January 2021, for 
experimental studies on mobile interventions targeting pregnant and postpartum 
women. We used pooled and narrative synthesis methods to analyze effectiveness 
and equity data, critically appraised the methodological rigour of included 
studies using Cochrane tools, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the 
GRADE approach. Our search identified 6148 records, of which 18 randomized and 
non-randomized controlled trials were included. Mobile interventions had a 
clinically important impact on reducing the occurrence of depression (OR = 0.51 
[95% CI 0.41 to 0.64]; absolute risk reduction RD: 7.14% [95% CI 4.92 to 9.36]; 
p<0.001) and preventing its severity perinatally (MD = -3.07; 95% CI -4.68 to 
-1.46; p<0.001). Mobile cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in 
managing postpartum depression (MD = -6.87; 95% CI -7.92 to -5.82; p<0.001), 
whereas other support-based interventions had no added benefit. Results on 
anxiety outcomes and utilization of care were limited. Our equity-focused 
analyses showed that ethnicity, age, education, and being primiparous were 
characteristics of influence to the effectiveness of mobile interventions.
CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for virtual mental 
health care, mobile interventions show promise in preventing and managing common 
mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women. Such interventions carry 
the potential to address health inequity but more rigorous research that 
examines patients' intersecting social identities is needed.

BACKGROUND: eHealth CF-CBT is the first digital mental health intervention for 
depression/anxiety in adults with cystic fibrosis (awCF); an 8-session 
therapist-guided internet-delivered program that was developed in English and 
Dutch with stakeholder input and evaluation indicating high acceptability and 
usability.
METHODS: Dutch eHealth CF-CBT was piloted in awCF with mild-moderate symptoms of 
depression and/or anxiety. Feasibility, usability, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy were assessed, measuring pre-post changes in depression 
(PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS), and health-related quality of 
life (CFQ-R).
RESULTS: All participants (n = 10, seven female, mean age 29 [range 21-43], mean 
FEV1 71%pred [range 31-115]) completed all sessions. Patient-rated feasibility, 
usability, and acceptability of eHealth CF-CBT were positive on validated 
scales, as were qualitative assessments of content and format. GAD-7 improved in 
90% of participants; in 50% by ≥the minimally important difference (MID) of four 
points. PHQ-9 improved in 90%; 40% by ≥the MID of 5. PSS improved in 80%. CFQ-R 
improved in the domain health perceptions (70%).
CONCLUSIONS: eHealth CF-CBT demonstrated feasibility, usability, acceptability, 
and promising preliminary efficacy in this pilot trial with Dutch awCF with mild 
to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety.

This paper describes the protocol to test the feasibility of the Safe management 
of people with Type 1 diabetes and EAting Disorders studY (STEADY) intervention. 
STEADY is a novel complex intervention for people with type 1 diabetes and 
disordered eating (T1DE) of mild to moderate severity. The STEADY intervention 
integrates cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with diabetes education, and was 
developed using Experience-Based Co-Design. METHODS: The feasibility of STEADY 
will be tested using a randomised controlled feasibility trial. Forty adults 
with T1DE will be recruited and randomised into the STEADY intervention or 
treatment as usual control group. We will collect demographic, biomedical and 
psychometric data, routine glucose metrics and conduct the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-5. Participants randomised to the STEADY intervention will 
receive 12 STEADY therapy sessions with a diabetes specialist nurse trained in 
CBT, delivered via videoconference and an optional smartphone app. The main 
outcome at 6 months will be the feasibility of STEADY (recruitment, dropout 
rates, feasibility of delivery). The secondary outcomes are biomedical (HbA1c 
and glucose time in range) and psychological (person-reported outcome measures 
in disordered eating, diabetes distress, depression and anxiety). A process 
evaluation will evaluate the fidelity, feasibility, acceptability and 
appropriateness of STEADY, and participant experiences. ETHICS AND 
DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the East of England-Essex Research 
Ethics Committee (21/EE/0235). Study findings will be shared with study 
participants and disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference 
presentations.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is common in breast cancer survivors (BCS), affecting an 
estimated 30-50% of the 3.8 million BCS in the US. Insomnia is associated with 
health consequences for cardiometabolic and immune systems, neurobehavioral 
function, depression, fatigue, and quality of life and may put BCS at particular 
risk. While pharmacotherapy for insomnia may address symptoms in the short-term, 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the gold 
standard insomnia treatment. We describe our protocol to determine the efficacy 
of voice-activated delivery of CBT-I components on insomnia symptoms compared to 
a sleep education control among BCS.
METHODS: We will conduct a 6-week, randomized controlled trial with two arms. 
Intervention arm participants will receive a smart speaker device and will be 
asked to engage with the program daily, using a voice-activated speaker with an 
accompanying smart-phone app. Control participants will have access to a website 
with basic information about CBT-I, sleep, and breast cancer survivorship and 
will be asked to engage with the website as desired.
DISCUSSION: Our primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index total score. 
Secondary outcomes include sleep diary outcomes (sleep efficiency, wake after 
sleep onset, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality). This 
study will provide evidence on a promising modality to deliver elements of CBT-I 
for BCS experiencing insomnia. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05233800

Objective: Where traditional approaches fall short, widely accessible and 
accepted, yet under leveraged, digital technologies such as text messaging 
present novel opportunities to solve a range of health care solutions. The 
following provides a preliminary analysis of the Text4Support program, a 
text-messaging intervention using the principles of cognitive behavioral 
therapy, which seeks to support the health and well-being of individuals seeking 
support for addiction or mental health concerns. The goal of this study was to 
assess whether the Text4Support program improved the perceived overall mental 
well-being of participants. Methods: The evaluation analyzes survey responses of 
individuals who were enrolled in the Text4Support program beginning in July 
2019, who had completed the 6-months program by May 2020. Participants were 
asked to provide responses to three surveys during their time in the program-at 
baseline, 12-weeks and 6-months, which included questions documenting 
demographic information, general satisfaction with the program, and a 
participants' level of "global distress" through use of the Clinical Outcomes 
Routine Evaluation System (CORE-10)-a validated brief 10-item assessment and 
outcome measurement tool used to assess conditions including anxiety, 
depression, physical problems, and risk to self. Results and Conclusions: This 
data set did not include a large enough sample of participants to reach 
statistical significance. Nevertheless, the study provides some preliminary 
analysis, and identifies opportunities for the future analysis and research.

Depressive disorders commonly are diagnosed and managed in primary care 
settings, and many patients prefer a nonpharmacologic approach. Traditionally, 
symptom reduction through pharmacotherapy has been the primary focus of 
management, but there is a growing acknowledgment of the need to develop 
modalities that prevent subsequent relapse and recurrences. Psychotherapy, 
including cognitive behavioral and interpersonal therapies, can have enduring 
effects that reduce subsequent risk in ways that drugs cannot. Although most 
family physicians do not provide formal psychosocial interventions for 
depression, brief interventions and behavioral intervention technologies, such 
as those that deliver care via the Internet or mobile device, are key means of 
increasing access to psychotherapy. For children and adolescents with mild, 
uncomplicated depression, physician-provided social support, encouragement, and 
reinforcement of adaptive behavior patterns can be as effective as cognitive 
behavioral therapy. In addition, a primary care physician's involvement in 
parent education and safety planning for suicide prevention holds promise for 
risk reduction. Evidence also supports the use of problem-solving therapy and 
components of cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy 
provided by primary care physicians for patients with depression.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of the onset of depression in adolescence may prevent 
social dysfunction, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, suicide, and mental 
health conditions in adulthood. New technologies allow delivery of prevention 
programs scalable to large and disparate populations.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the novel mobile phone delivery of a depression 
prevention intervention for adolescents. We describe the development of the 
intervention and the results of participants' self-reported satisfaction with 
the intervention.
METHODS: The intervention was developed from 15 key messages derived from 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The program was fully automated and 
delivered in 2 mobile phone messages/day for 9 weeks, with a mixture of text, 
video, and cartoon messages and a mobile website. Delivery modalities were 
guided by social cognitive theory and marketing principles. The intervention was 
compared with an attention control program of the same number and types of 
messages on different topics. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was 
undertaken in high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, from June 2009 to April 
2011.
RESULTS: A total of 1348 students (13-17 years of age) volunteered to 
participate at group sessions in schools, and 855 were eventually randomly 
assigned to groups. Of these, 835 (97.7%) self-completed follow-up 
questionnaires at postprogram interviews on satisfaction, perceived usefulness, 
and adherence to the intervention. Over three-quarters of participants viewed at 
least half of the messages and 90.7% (379/418) in the intervention group 
reported they would refer the program to a friend. Intervention group 
participants said the intervention helped them to be more positive (279/418, 
66.7%) and to get rid of negative thoughts (210/418, 50.2%)--significantly 
higher than proportions in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Key messages from CBT can be delivered by mobile phone, and young 
people report that these are helpful. Change in clinician-rated depression 
symptom scores from baseline to 12 months, yet to be completed, will provide 
evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention. If proven effective, this 
form of delivery may be useful in many countries lacking widespread mental 
health services but with extensive mobile phone coverage. CLINICALTRIAL:

The death of a loved one has physical, psychological, and social consequences. 
Between 9.8 and 21.5 % of people who lose a loved one develop Prolonged Grief 
Disorder (PGD). Internet- and computer-based interventions (i.e., 
Internet-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, iCBT) are cost-effective and 
scalable alternatives that make it possible to reach more people with PGD. The 
main goal of the present investigation was to examine the effect and feasibility 
(usability and satisfaction) of an iCBT (GROw program) for adults with PGD. A 
secondary objective was to detect adherence to the app (Emotional Monitor) used 
to measure daily grief symptoms. The study had a single-case multiple-baseline 
AB design with six participants. The GROw program is organized sequentially in 
eight modules, and it is based on the dual-process model of coping with 
bereavement. Evaluations included a pre-to-post treatment assessment of 
depression, grief symptoms, and typical grief beliefs, along with daily measures 
of symptom frequency and intensity on the Emotional Monitor App. Treatment 
opinions and adherence to the App were also collected. Efficacy data were 
calculated using a Nonoverlap of All Pairs (NAP) analysis and Reliable Change 
Index (RCI). The mean age of the sample was 29.5 years (SD = 8.19). Two 
participants dropped out of the study. Adherence to the App varied across 
patients (4.8 % -77.8 %). Most participants (75 %) showed a clinically 
significant change (recovered) in depression, and 50 % obtained a clinically 
significant improvement (recovered) in symptoms of loss and typical beliefs in 
complicated grief. The participants reported high usability and satisfaction 
with the treatment content and format. In sum, the GROw program was very well 
accepted and generally feasible, and it has strong potential for treating PGD. 
The results support scaling up the treatment by using more complex designs with 
larger samples (i.e., randomized controlled trials comparing GROw with active 
conditions).

OBJECTIVES: Insomnia prevalence increases with age. Although cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is the first-line treatment, limited 
accessibility leaves many older adults with few effective treatment options. 
This study assessed the efficacy of digital CBT (dCBT) for treating insomnia, 
anxiety, and depression symptoms in adults aged 65 and older.
METHOD: Data from three published randomized controlled trials of dCBT for 
insomnia (Sleepio) versus controls were combined for those aged 65+ with 
insomnia disorder (N = 315). Insomnia, anxiety, and depression scores were 
standardized into z-scores for comparison. Mixed-effects models estimated the 
treatment effect on insomnia, depression, and anxiety outcomes at post-treatment 
(8-10 wk) and follow-up (24 wk). Chi-squared tests of Sleep Condition Indicator 
(SCI-8) scores evaluated post-treatment insomnia remission rates between groups.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, dCBT generated significantly greater 
improvements at post-treatment and follow-up in insomnia (gs ≤ -1.88, ps < 
0.001) and depression (gs ≤ -0.44, ps ≤ 0.001) and significantly greater 
improvements in anxiety at post-treatment (g = -0.33, p < 0.001). dCBT generated 
higher post-treatment insomnia remission rates (60% vs. 16%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: dCBT can effectively improve symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and 
depression in adults aged 65+. Digital CBT may serve as an accessible means for

BACKGROUND: Mood tracking is commonly employed within a range of mental health 
interventions. Physical activity and sleep are also important for 
contextualizing mood data but can be difficult to track manually and rely on 
retrospective recall. Smartwatches could enhance self-monitoring by addressing 
difficulties in recall of sleep and physical activity and reducing the burden on 
patients in terms of remembering to track and the effort of tracking. This 
feasibility study will explore the acceptance of a smartwatch app for 
self-monitoring of mood, sleep, and physical activity, in an internet-based 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression offered in a routine care 
setting.
METHODS: Seventy participants will be randomly allocated to (i) iCBT 
intervention plus smartwatch app or (ii) iCBT intervention alone. Patient 
acceptance will be measured longitudinally using a theory-based acceptance 
questionnaire to understand and compare the evolution of acceptance of the 
technology-delivered self-report in the two groups. A post-treatment interview 
will explore participants subjective experience of using the smartwatch. 
Engagement with the intervention, including self-report, and clinical outcomes, 
will be measured across both groups to assess for any differences.
IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study investigating the evolution of patient 
acceptance of smartwatch self-report in an iCBT delivered intervention in a 
clinical sample. Through an engaging and convenient means of capturing 
ecologically valid mood data, the study has the potential to show that 
smartwatches are an acceptable means for patient self-monitoring within iCBT 
interventions for depression and support potential use-cases for smartwatches in 
the context of mental health interventions in general. Prospectively registered 
at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04568317).

BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders, including depression and anxiety, are 
leading causes of disability worldwide. Digital mental health interventions, 
such as web-based self-help and other low-intensity treatments (LITs) that are 
not digital (eg, bibliotherapy), have the potential to reach many individuals by 
circumventing common barriers present in traditional mental health care. It is 
unclear how often LITs are used in clinical practice, or whether providers would 
be interested in their use for treatment waiting lists.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) describe current practices for 
treatment waiting lists, (2) describe providers' attitudes toward digital and 
nondigital LITs for patients on a waiting list, and (3) explore providers' 
willingness to use digital and nondigital LITs and their decisions to learn 
about them.
METHODS: We surveyed 141 practicing mental health care providers (eg, therapists 
and psychologists) and provided an opportunity for them to learn about LITs.
RESULTS: Most participants reported keeping a waiting list. Few participants 
reported currently recommending digital or nondigital LITs, though most were 
willing to use at least one for patients on their waiting list. Attitudes toward 
digital and nondigital LITs were neutral to positive. Guided digital and 
nondigital LITs were generally perceived to be more effective but less 
accessible, and unguided interventions were perceived to be less effective but 
more accessible. Most participants selected to access additional information on 
LITs, with the most popular being web-based self-help.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest providers are currently not recommending LITs for 
patients on treatment waiting lists but would be willing to recommend them. 
Future work should explore barriers and facilitators to implementing digital and 
nondigital LITs for patients on treatment waiting lists.

BACKGROUND: Health professionals face significant psychological burdens 
including burnout, anxiety, and depression. These can negatively impact their 
well-being and patient care. Traditional psychological health interventions 
often encounter limitations such as a lack of accessibility and privacy. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are being explored as potential solutions 
to these challenges, offering available and immediate support. Therefore, it is 
necessary to systematically evaluate the characteristics and effectiveness of AI 
chatbots designed specifically for health professionals.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to evaluate the existing literature on the 
use of AI chatbots for psychological health support among health professionals.
METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework, a comprehensive literature 
search was conducted across eight databases, covering studies published before 
2024, including backward and forward citation tracking and manual searching from 
the included studies. Studies were screened for relevance based on inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, among 2465 studies retrieved, 10 studies met the criteria 
for review.
RESULTS: Among the 10 studies, six chatbots were delivered via mobile platforms, 
and four via web-based platforms, all enabling one-on-one interactions. Natural 
language processing algorithms were used in six studies and cognitive behavioral 
therapy techniques were applied to psychological health in four studies. 
Usability was evaluated in six studies through participant feedback and 
engagement metrics. Improvements in anxiety, depression, and burnout were 
observed in four studies, although one reported an increase in depressive 
symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: AI chatbots show potential tools to support the psychological 
health of health professionals by offering personalized and accessible 
interventions. Nonetheless, further research is required to establish 
standardized protocols and validate the effectiveness of these interventions. 
Future studies should focus on refining chatbot designs and assessing their 
impact on diverse health professionals.

PURPOSE: Digital health interventions (DHIs) offer scalable solutions for 
improving mental health care access in underserved settings. This study is part 
of a multi-phased project aimed at adapting a depression prevention DHI for 
Jordanian adolescents. It evaluated the feasibility, cultural acceptability, and 
effectiveness of the translated and culturally adapted DHI, named Al-Khaizuran, 
with comparisons to school-based group CBT.
METHODS: A two-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial with a 
mixed-methods design was conducted among 109 Jordanian adolescents aged 15-17 
years experiencing mild to moderate depression. Participants were randomly 
assigned to either Al-Khaizuran DHI (n=55) or school-based group CBT (n=54). The 
adaptation of Al-Khaizuran DHI components was guided by the Ecological Validity 
Framework, while the procedural adaptation followed Barrera and Castro's 
Heuristic Framework, incorporating iterative refinement based on user feedback 
and contextual considerations.
RESULTS: Al-Khaizuran DHI was found to be a culturally relevant and acceptable 
intervention for Jordanian adolescent. Over half of the participants reported 
that the intervention was effective, empowering, and easy to use, with 51% 
expressing satisfaction and willingness to recommend it. However, challenges 
such as limited access to personal devices, privacy concerns, and participants' 
reliance on shared family resources emerged as significant barriers to 
consistent engagement. Participants showed a preference for individualized, 
blended interventions, with a significant reduction in support for group CBT. No 
significant difference was found in depression scores between the two groups. 
However, the Al-Khaizuran DHI group demonstrated higher post-intervention 
resilience scores (p=0.026). Beliefs about the effectiveness of the intervention 
significantly predicted behavioral intention (p=0.022), while perceived 
difficulty was a barrier to adherence (p=0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Al-Khaizuran DHI exemplifies the potential of culturally adapted 
digital interventions in bridging mental health care gaps in resource-limited 
settings. However, its effectiveness is contingent upon addressing barriers to 
access, enhancing program interactivity, and integrating hybrid support systems 
that combine digital tools with in-person guidance. Future implementations 
should consider strategies to actively engage parents to foster a supportive 
environment that promotes the well-being of adolescents.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization reported that 80% of new HIV diagnoses 
in Europe in 2014 occurred in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania has a 
particularly high HIV incidence, AIDS prevalence, and number of related deaths. 
HIV incidence in Romania is largely attributed to sexual contact among gay and 
bisexual men. However, homophobic stigma in Romania serves as a risk factor for 
HIV infection for gay and bisexual men. The Comunică intervention aims to 
provide a much-needed HIV risk reduction strategy, and it entails the delivery 
of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy skills across 8 
live text-based counseling sessions on a mobile platform to gay and bisexual men 
at risk of HIV. The intervention is based on the information-motivation-behavior 
and minority stress models. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that 
Comunică holds promise for reducing gay and bisexual men's co-occurring sexual 
(eg, HIV transmission risk behavior), behavioral (eg, heavy alcohol use), and 
mental (eg, depression) health risks in Romania.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial 
designed to test the efficacy of Comunică in a national trial.
METHODS: To test Comunică's efficacy, 305 gay and bisexual men were randomized 
to receive Comunică or a content-matched education attention control condition. 
The control condition consisted of 8 time-matched educational modules that 
present information regarding gay and bisexual men's identity development, 
information about HIV transmission and prevention, the importance of HIV and 
sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, heavy alcohol use and its 
associations with HIV transmission risk behavior, sexual health communication, 
finding social support, and creating sexual health goals. Participants undergo 
rapid HIV and syphilis testing and 3-site chlamydia and gonorrhea testing at 
baseline and the 12-month follow-up. Outcomes are measured before the 
intervention (baseline) and at the 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups.
RESULTS: The study was funded in September 2018, and data collection began in 
May 2019. The last participant follow-up was in January 2024. Currently, the 
data analyst is cleaning data sets in preparation for data analyses, which are 
scheduled to begin in April 2024. Data analysis meetings are scheduled regularly 
to establish timelines and examine the results as analyses are gradually being 
conducted. Upon completion, a list of manuscripts will be reviewed and 
prioritized, and the team will begin preparing them for publication.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to test the efficacy of an intervention 
with the potential to simultaneously support the sexual, behavioral, and mental 
health of gay and bisexual men in Central and Eastern Europe using motivational 
interviewing support and sensitivity to the high-stigma context of the region. 
If efficacious, Comunică presents a scalable platform to provide support to gay 
and bisexual men living in Romania and similar high-stigma, low-resource 
countries.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent among older adults. However, 
most older adults have poor access to age-specific mental health services. While 
Information technology-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) has shown 
promise as an accessible alternative to face-to-face interventions, its 
effectiveness specifically within the older adults warrants further 
investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of ICBT on depression and anxiety 
symptoms among older adults.
METHODS: Research articles retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, 
Web of Science, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE from inception to April 10, 2024, were 
reviewed. The search was designed to identify Randomized Controlled Trials 
(RCTs) that examined the efficacy of ICBT in reducing self-reported depression 
or anxiety symptoms in older adults. The quality of included studies was 
assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, version 
2.0. Posttreatment means and standard deviations (SDs) were compared between 
intervention and control groups, and pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 11 RCTs were eligible for inclusion in this review. Compared 
to control groups, ICBT yielded small to medium post-treatment pooled effect 
sizes regarding depressive symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.65, 95 % CI -0.95 to -0.35; 
P < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.47, 95 % CI -0.74 to -0.19; 
P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that: (1) interventions lasting ≥8 weeks 
(Hedges' g = -0.88, 95 % CI -1.37 to -0.39; P < 0.001) were more effective than 
<8 weeks for depressive symptoms; however, <8 weeks (Hedges' g = -0.52, 95 % CI 
-0.93 to -0.10; P = 0.014) was more effective for anxiety symptoms; (2) ICBT 
delivered through slideshows was more effective than through other digital 
platforms for both depressive (Hedges' g = -1.36, 95 % CI -2.40 to -0.31; 
P = 0.011) and anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = -1.00, 95 % CI -1.30 to -0.70; 
P < 0.001); and (3) non-tailored ICBT was more effective than tailored versions 
for both depressive (Hedges' g = -1.06, 95 % CI -2.03 to -0.09; P = 0.032) and 
anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.70, 95 % CI -1.14 to -0.27; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis reinforces the effectiveness of ICBT in 
relieving depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults. Future research 
should identify the most effective components of ICBT to optimize their 
development.

OBJECTIVE: Despite high rates of prenatal insomnia, efficacious treatment 
options for this population are quite limited. Early evidence from randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) support the efficacy of face-to-face 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for prenatal insomnia. Yet, as 
many patients are unable to access this specialist-driven care, a critical need 
exists to increase its accessibility. This RCT examined the efficacy 
internet-based digital CBTI in pregnant women with insomnia.
METHODS: Single-site RCT. A total of 91 pregnant women (29.03 ± 4.16 years) 
nearing/entering the third trimester who screened positive for clinical insomnia 
on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were randomized to digital CBTI or digital 
sleep education control. The ISI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale's 
Cognitive factor (PSAS-C) served as study outcomes, which were collected before 
treatment and after treatment during pregnancy, then six weeks after childbirth.
RESULTS: From pre to posttreatment, CBTI patients reported reductions in ISI 
(-4.91 points, p < 0.001) and PSQI (-2.98 points, p < 0.001) and increases in 
nightly sleep duration by 32 min (p = 0.008). Sleep symptoms did not change 
during pregnancy in the control group. After childbirth, CBTI patients, relative 
to controls, slept longer by 40 min per night (p = 0.01) and reported better 
sleep maintenance. No pre or postnatal treatment effects on depression or 
cognitive arousal were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBTI improves sleep quality and sleep duration during 
pregnancy and after childbirth. To better optimize outcomes, CBTI should be 
tailored to meet the changing needs of women as the progress through pregnancy 
and early parenting. NAME: Insomnia and Rumination in Late Pregnancy and the

BACKGROUND: Blended therapy (BT) combines digital with face-to-face 
psychological interventions. BT may improve access to treatment, therapy uptake, 
and adherence. However, research is scarce on the structure of BT models.
OBJECTIVE: We synthesized the literature to describe BT models used for the 
treatment of psychological disorders in adults. We investigated whether BT 
structure, content, and ratio affected treatment efficacy, uptake, and 
adherence. We also conducted meta-analyses to examine treatment efficacy in 
intervention-control dyads and associations between treatment outcomes versus BT 
model structure.
METHODS: PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, and MEDLINE databases were 
searched. Eligibility criteria included articles published in English till March 
2023 that described digital and face-to-face elements as part of an intervention 
plan for treating psychological disorders in adult patients. We developed a 
coding framework to characterize the BT interventions. A meta-analysis was 
conducted to calculate effect size (ES; Cohen d and 95% CIs) regarding pre- and 
posttreatment outcomes in depression and anxiety versus BT structure. The review 
was registered with PROSPERO and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.
RESULTS: Searches identified 8436 articles, and data were extracted from 29 
studies. BT interventions were analyzed and classified according to mode of 
interaction between digital and face-to-face components (integrated vs 
sequential), role of the components (core vs supplementary), component delivery 
(alternate vs case-by-case), and digital materials assignment mode (standardized 
vs personalized). Most BT interventions (n=24) used a cognitive behavioral 
therapy approach for anxiety or depression treatment. Mean rates of uptake (91%) 
and adherence (81%) were reported across individual studies. BT interventions 
were more effective or noninferior to treatment as usual, with large spread in 
the data and a moderate to large ES in the treatment of depression (n=9; Cohen 
d=-1.1, 95% CI -0.6 to -1.6, P<.001, and z score=-4.3). A small, nonsignificant 
ES was found for anxiety outcomes (n=5; Cohen d=-0.1, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.05, 
P=.17, and z score=-1.4). Higher ESs were found in blended interventions with 
supplementary design (depression: n=11, Cohen d=-0.75, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.95; 
anxiety: n=8, Cohen d=-0.9, 95% CI -0.6 to -1.2); fewer (≤6) face-to-face 
sessions (depression: n=9, Cohen d=-0.7, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.9; anxiety: n=7, 
Cohen d=-0.8, 95% CI -0.3 to -1.3); and a lower ratio (≤50%) of face-to-face 
versus digital sessions (depression: n=5, Cohen d=-0.8, 95% CI -0.6 to -1.1; 
anxiety: n=4, Cohen d=-0.8, 95% CI 0.006 to -1.6).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed integrated BT models as feasible to deliver. 
We found BT to be effective in depression treatment, but anxiety treatment 
results were nonsignificant. Future studies assessing outcomes across different 
psychological disorders and therapeutic approaches are required.

BACKGROUND: The perinatal period is a challenging time of substantial emotional, 
physiological, social, and relational changes. Depression, anxiety, and stress 
symptoms are common, and co-exist in the perinatal period. Digital technology 
continues to grow at an unprecedented pace with wide application, including 
psychotherapeutic intervention. A growing number of meta-analyses supported the 
application of digital psychotherapeutic intervention across different 
populations, but relatively few meta- and meta-regression analyses have 
concentrated on perinatal women.
AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of digital psychotherapeutic intervention on 
improving psychological outcomes among perinatal women and identify its 
essential features.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were obtained from eight databases, 
including Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane 
Library, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and ProQuest 
Dissertation and Theses from inception up until November 24, 2020. Comprehensive 
Meta-analysis 3.0 software was used to conduct meta- and meta-regression 
analyses. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Grading of the Recommendation, 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system were adopted to assess the 
individual and overall qualities of the evidence, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 25 RCTs that included 3239 women were identified. 
Meta-analyses revealed that intervention significantly improved depression 
(Hedges's g = 0.49), anxiety (g = 0.25), and stress (g = 0.47) symptoms compared 
to the control. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that a website platform with ≥ 
eight therapist-guided sessions using the theoretical principle of cognitive 
behavioral therapy was more effective than other treatments in improving 
depression symptoms in postnatal women. Meta-regression analyses observed that 
the age of perinatal women and the type of psychotherapy also had statistically 
significant effects on depression symptoms. Egger's regression asymmetry tests 
suggested that no publication biases occurred, but the overall quality of the 
evidence was very low.
CONCLUSION: This review suggests that digital psychotherapeutic intervention may 
be a potential solution to reduce psychological problems in perinatal women. 
Further high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes are needed.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the most commonly reported sleep disturbance and 
significantly impacts mental health and quality of life. Traditional treatments 
for insomnia include pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but these options may not be accessible to 
everyone who needs treatment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the app-based 
Headspace Sleep Program in adults with clinical insomnia on sleep disturbance 
and mental health outcomes, compared with a waitlist control group.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 132 adults with clinical 
insomnia who were assigned to either the Headspace Sleep Program (an 18-session 
self-guided, in-app program utilizing CBT-I techniques augmented by mindfulness) 
or a waitlist control group. Sleep disturbance outcomes were assessed by changes 
in insomnia symptoms (measured using the Insomnia Severity Index) and sleep 
efficiency (measured via sleep diary and actigraphy). Mental health outcomes 
included perceived stress (measured by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale), 
depressive symptoms (measured by the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire), sleep 
quality (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), anxiety symptoms 
(measured by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), and mindfulness 
(measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale). Changes from baseline to 
postintervention and follow-up were assessed for each outcome.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 37.2 (10.6) years, with 69 out of 
132 (52.3%) identifying as female. Those randomized to the Headspace Sleep 
Program group experienced significantly greater improvements in insomnia 
symptoms from baseline to postintervention and follow-up compared with 
participants in the waitlist control group (P<.001, η²p=0.107). Improvements 
from baseline to postintervention and follow-up were also observed in the 
Headspace Sleep Program group for sleep efficiency, as measured by both sleep 
diary (P=.01, η²p=.03) and actigraphy outcomes (P=.01, η²p=.03). Participants in 
the Headspace Sleep Program group showed greater improvements in insomnia 
remission rates (8/66, 12%, at postintervention and 9/66, 14%, at follow-up) and 
treatment response (11/66, 17%, at postintervention and 15/66, 23%, at 
follow-up) compared with the control group (remission rate 2/66, 3%, at 
postintervention and 0/66, 0%, at follow-up; treatment response 3/66, 5%, at 
postintervention and 1/66, 2%, at follow-up). The results suggest significant 
improvements in depressive symptoms (P=.01, η²p=.04), anxiety symptoms (P=.02, 
η²p=.02), and mindfulness (P=.01, η²p=.03) in the Headspace Sleep Program group.
CONCLUSIONS: The Headspace Sleep Program is an effective intervention for 
improving sleep disturbances in adults with clinical insomnia.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that insomnia may be an important therapeutic 
target to improve mental health.
AIMS: Evaluating changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety after supported 
digital cognitive behavioural therapy (dCBT) for insomnia delivered via a 
community-based provider (Self Help Manchester) of the Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service.
METHOD: Supported dCBT for insomnia was delivered to 98 clients (mean age 44.9 
years, SD 15.2, 66% female) of Self Help Manchester. All clients received six 
support calls from an eTherapy coordinator to support the self-help dCBT. During 
these calls levels of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) and 
anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7) were determined.
RESULTS: Depression (M difference-5.7, t(70) = 12.5, p < .001) and anxiety 
[Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), M difference-4.1, t(70) = 8.0, p < 
.001] were reduced following supported dCBT for insomnia. This translated into 
an IAPT recovery rate of 68% for depression and anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dCBT for insomnia alleviates depression 
and anxiety in clients presenting with mental health complaints in routine 
healthcare.

Transdiagnostic individually-tailored digital interventions reduce symptoms of 
depression and anxiety in adults with moderate effects. However, research into 
these approaches for college students is scarce and contradicting. In addition, 
the exact reasons for intervention dropout in this target group are not well 
known, and the use of individually-tailored intervention features, such as 
optional modules, has not yet been explored. The current study aimed to (1) 
investigate reasons for dropout from a guided internet-based transdiagnostic 
individually-tailored intervention for college students assessed in a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) and (2) evaluate whether participants used tailoring 
features intended for their baseline symptoms. A sample of college students with 
mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety symptoms (n = 48) in the Netherlands 
(partially) followed a guided internet-based transdiagnostic 
individually-tailored intervention. We contacted those who did not complete the 
entire intervention (n = 29) by phone to report the reasons for intervention 
dropout. Further, we descriptively explored the use of tailoring features (i.e., 
depression versus anxiety trajectory) and optional modules of the intervention 
in the whole sample. We identified a range of person- and intervention-related 
reasons for intervention dropout, most commonly busy schedules, needs for 
different kinds of help, or absence of personal contact. Furthermore, only less 
than half of the participants used the individually-tailoring features to 
address the symptoms they reported as predominant. In conclusion, digital 
interventions clear about the content and targeted symptoms, tested in user 
research could prevent dropout and create reasonable expectations of the 
intervention. Participants would benefit from additional guidance when using 
tailoring features of digital interventions, as they often do not choose the 
tailoring features targeting their baseline symptoms.

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are becoming more popular and more 
powerful resources for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety 
due to advances in technological capacity and analytic sophistication. Previous 
work has demonstrated that EMIs can be effective at reducing symptoms of 
depression and anxiety as well as related outcomes of stress and at increasing 
positive psychological functioning. In this review, we highlight the differences 
between EMIs and other forms of treatment due to the nature of EMIs to be deeply 
integrated into the fabric of people's day-to-day lives. EMIs require unique 
considerations in their design, deployment, and evaluation. Furthermore, given 
that EMIs have been advanced by changes in technologies and that the use of 
behavioral intervention technologies for mental health has been increasing, we 
discuss how technologies and analytics might usher in a new era of EMIs. Future 
EMIs might reduce user burden and increase intervention personalization and 
sophistication by leveraging digital sensors and advances in natural language 
processing and machine learning. Thus, although current EMIs are effective, the 
EMIs of the future might be more engaging, responsive, and adaptable to 
different people and different contexts.

Using data from 1721 participants in a community-based randomized control trial 
of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia compared with patient 
education, we employed linear mixed modelling analyses to examine whether 
chronotype moderated the benefits of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for 
insomnia on self-reported levels of insomnia severity, fatigue and psychological 
distress. Baseline self-ratings on the reduced version of the Horne-Östberg 
Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire were used to categorize the sample into 
three chronotypes: morning type (n = 345; 20%); intermediate type (n = 843; 
49%); and evening type (n = 524; 30%). Insomnia Severity Index, Chalder Fatigue 
Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were assessed pre- and 
post-intervention (9 weeks). For individuals with self-reported morning or 
intermediate chronotypes, digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was 
superior to patient education on all ratings (Insomnia Severity Index, Chalder 
Fatigue Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at follow-up 
(p-values ≤ 0.05). For individuals with self-reported evening chronotype, 
digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was superior to patient 
education for Insomnia Severity Index and Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, but not 
on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (p = 0.139). There were significant 
differences in the treatment effects between the three chronotypes on the 
Insomnia Severity Index (p = 0.023) estimated difference between evening and 
morning type of -1.70, 95% confidence interval: -2.96 to -0.45, p = 0.008, and 
estimated difference between evening and intermediate type -1.53, 95% confidence 
interval: -3.04 to -0.03, p = 0.046. There were no significant differences in 
the treatment effects between the three chronotypes on the Chalder Fatigue 
Questionnaire (p = 0.488) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(p = 0.536). We conclude that self-reported chronotype moderates the effects of 
digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on insomnia severity, but not 
on psychological distress or fatigue.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps individuals to eliminate avoidant and 
safety-seeking behaviors that prevent self-correction of faulty beliefs, thereby 
facilitating stress management to reduce stress-related disorders and enhance 
mental health. The present review evaluated the effectiveness of CBT in 
stressful conditions among clinical and general populations, and identified 
recent advances in CBT-related techniques. A search of the literature for 
studies conducted during 1987-2021 identified 345 articles relating to 
biopsychosocial medicine; 154 (45%) were review articles, including 14 systemic 
reviews, and 53 (15%) were clinical trials including 45 randomized controlled 
trials. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that CBT 
was effective for a variety of mental problems (e.g., anxiety disorder, 
attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression, 
hypochondriasis), physical conditions (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, 
fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, breast cancer), and behavioral problems 
(e.g., antisocial behaviors, drug abuse, gambling, overweight, smoking), at 
least in the short term; more follow-up observations are needed to assess the 
long-term effects of CBT. Mental and physical problems can likely be managed 
effectively with online CBT or self-help CBT using a mobile app, but these 
should be applied with care, considering their cost-effectiveness and 
applicability to a given population.

BACKGROUND: War conditions can severely impact sleep and mental health at the 
population level, especially in the conflicts of such tremendous scale as in 
Ukraine. The aim of this research was to study whether a mobile, unguided 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based Intervention for sleep problems, Sleep2, is 
feasible, acceptable, and potentially able to reduce mental health/sleep 
problems symptoms.
METHODS: A single-arm, open-label, uncontrolled pre-post evaluation study was 
conducted with 487 registered participants: 283 started, 160 (56.55%) finished, 
out of which 95 completed without an ambulatory heart rate (HR) sensor and 65 
with. Assessments were conducted through online questionnaires and objective 
measurements via HR sensors. Besides feasibility and acceptability, outcome 
measures included symptoms in several mental health domains alongside 
self-reported and objectively reported sleep parameter.
RESULTS: Engagement with the Sleep2 app was high, achieving an 80.72% compliance 
rate, alongside high levels of feasibility and acceptance. Participants reported 
significant pre-post reductions in the severity of symptoms, with sleep problems 
decreasing by 22.60% (Cohen's d = 0.53), insomnia by 35.08% (d = 0.69), fear of 
sleep by 32.43% (d = 0.25), anxiety by 27.72% (d = 0.48), depression by 28.67% 
(d = 0.52), PTSD by 32.41% (d = 0.51), somatic symptoms by 24.52% (d = 0.51), 
and perceived stress by 17.90% (d = 0.39). Objective sleep measurements showed a 
significant reduction in sleep onset latency only.
CONCLUSION: The 'Sleep2Ukraine' program demonstrated high feasibility and 
acceptance, with significant improvements in subjective sleep and mental health 
measures among participants. However, given the study's uncontrolled design and 
reliance on self-selected participants, these findings should be considered 
preliminary. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. 
Nonetheless, the results highlight the potential of culturally adapted, 
scalable, mobile-based CBT-I interventions to address sleep and mental health 
needs in war-affected populations.

BACKGROUND: Face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most 
promising treatment to reduce stress, but access to CBT is limited. 
Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) enables large-scale dissemination at low costs. 
Evidence suggests that ICBT can reduce stress in subclinical and mixed 
diagnostic samples, but less is known about the effect of ICBT in targeted 
samples suffering from elevated perceived stress or stress-related disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of ICBT specifically aimed at reducing 
stress in adults with elevated perceived stress or stress-related disorders.
METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing ICBT with a 
control group in PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo between 2010 and 2021. A 
meta-analysis of 14 comparisons (total N = 1831) was performed, and Cohen's d 
was calculated to assess the difference between intervention and control groups 
at posttest for the primary outcome self-rated stress. Effects on secondary 
outcomes of anxiety and depression were also investigated.
RESULTS: The pooled mean effect size for self-rated stress at posttest was 
d = 0.78 [CI 95 % 0.66-0.90]. For anxiety and depression, the effects were 
d = 0.69 [95 % CI 0.52-0.86] and d = 0.65 [95 % CI 0.56-0.75] respectively. The 
heterogeneity of results between studies was overall low to moderate. Subgroup 
analyses were not conducted due to the limited number of studies eligible for 
inclusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence of the efficacy of ICBT to reduce stress, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms in adults suffering from elevated stress or 
stress-related disorders. Findings have important implications for the 
development of safe and evidence-based treatment guidelines in the face of a 
rapid digital expansion.This study was preregistered at Open Science Framework

BACKGROUND: Emerging approaches to building more efficient and effective 
behavioral interventions are becoming more widely available. The current paper 
provides an empirical example of the use of the engineering-inspired multiphase 
optimization strategy (MOST) to build a remotely delivered responsive parenting 
intervention to prevent obesity among children of low-income mothers with and 
without depressive symptoms.
METHODS: Participants were 107 mothers with (n = 45) and without (n = 62) 
depressive symptoms who had a child aged 12 to 42 months participating in the 
Women, Infants and Children program. Participants were randomized to one of 
sixteen experimental conditions using a factorial design that included a 
combination of the following eight remotely delivered intervention components: 
responsive feeding curriculum (given to all participants), parenting curriculum, 
portion size guidance, obesogenic risk assessment, personalized feedback on 
mealtime routines, feeding curriculum counseling, goal setting, mobile 
messaging, and social support. This design enabled efficient identification of 
components with low feasibility and acceptability.
RESULTS: Completion rates were high (85%) and did not statistically differ by 
depressive symptoms. However, mothers with depressive symptoms who received 
obesogenic risk assessment and personalized feedback on mealtime routines 
components had lower completion rates than mothers without depressive symptoms. 
All intervention components were feasible to implement except the social support 
component. Regardless of experimental condition, most participants reported that 
the program increased their awareness of what, when, and how to feed their 
children.
CONCLUSIONS: MOST provided an efficient way to assess the feasibility of 
components prior to testing them with a fully powered experiment. This framework 
helped identify potentially challenging combinations of remotely delivered 
intervention components. Consideration of how these results can inform future 
studies focused on the optimization phase of MOST is discussed.

Women of low income and education have lower levels of peripartum depression 
(PPD) literacy, limiting their ability to recognize symptoms and make informed 
healthcare decisions. Existing digital solutions and underlying development 
frameworks for PPD lack an integrative approach addressing health literacy and 
related disparities. Therefore, we develop an integrative framework for digital 
content engineering in PPD self-management consisting of (a) user needs 
analysis, (b) inclusion of eHealth literacy principles (science and health 
literacy), and (c) mapping user needs to the Behavioral Intervention Technology 
model. Results revealed that perinatal women seeking mental health care prefer 
information in multisensory formats, and knowledge needs were identified in 
areas such as medication management and coping with abnormal results. Results 
were mapped to eHealth literacy features of whiteboard videos covering essential 
PPD knowledge, and social media features where patients can articulate 
information needs. Initial evaluation of proposed features against existing PPD 
self-management solutions are discussed.

Delusions are one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders 
(SSD), associated with distress and impaired functioning. Traditional Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approaches are less effective for delusions, require 
significant resources, and specialized staff training. Symptom-specific therapy 
approaches, which target factors involved in the development and maintenance of 
psychotic symptoms, provide a valid alternative. Recent research demonstrates 
the efficacy of coping strategies as an intervention element, however, so far, 
only in the context of auditory hallucinations. Digital technologies, such as 
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention 
(EMI), are gaining attention in mental health, providing enhanced assessment and 
intervention opportunities. The present single-arm trial aimed to investigate 
the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a smartphone-based 
blended EMA/I psychological therapy approach focusing on improving coping 
strategies for delusions in SSD. In total, N = 10 participants received four 
face-to-face therapy sessions alongside German university-level 
treatment-as-usual over an intervention period of four to six weeks. Feasibility 
was assessed by completion rates of the EMA/I questionnaires, use of the 
application between sessions and recruitment rates. Acceptability was assessed 
by a satisfaction questionnaire, open feedback, and analysis of adverse effects. 
Clinical outcomes included self-rated and rater-based intensity and distress of 
delusions and comorbid symptoms at pre- and post-intervention. Findings 
supported the feasibility and acceptability of the DICE (DICE - Delusion 
Ideation in the Context of Everyday life intervention) intervention, with high 
retention (10/13 participants, 77 %) and completion rates for the EMA- (59 %) 
and EMI-questionnaires (72 %), as well as a high protocol adherence (90-97 %), 
exceeding all predefined benchmarks. Open feedback indicated good satisfaction, 
with all participants using the application between sessions, reflecting a high 
engagement level. Clinical outcomes displayed relevant changes in ameliorating 
the intensity of delusions when being measured by the Psychotic Symptom Rating 
Scales as well as by the Green Paranoid Thought Scale, and self-rated 
improvements in distress and depressive symptoms. Changes in the intensity and 
distress of delusions might be explained by improved coping behaviour. Further 
research with control conditions is needed to validate findings and analyze the 
efficacy as well as mechanisms of actions of the intervention in a fully powered 
trial.

BACKGROUND: The lack of trained mental health professionals is a key barrier to 
scale-up of evidence-based psychological interventions in low and middle-income 
countries. We have developed an app that allows a peer with no prior experience 
of health-care delivery to deliver the cognitive therapy-based intervention for 
perinatal depression, the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP). This trial aims to 
assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this Technology-assisted 
peer-delivered THP versus standard face-to-face Thinking Healthy Programme 
delivered by trained health workers.
METHODS: We will employ a non-inferiority stratified cluster randomized 
controlled trial design comparing the two formats of intervention delivery. A 
total of 980 women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy with a 
diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode, evaluated with the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-V Disorders (SCID), will be recruited into the trial. The unit 
of randomization will be 70 village clusters randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio 
to the intervention and control arms. The primary outcome is defined as 
remission from major depressive episode at 3 months postnatal measured with the 
SCID. Data will also be collected on symptoms of anxiety, disability, quality of 
life, service use and costs, and infant-related outcomes such as exclusive 
breastfeeding and immunization rates. Data will be collected on the primary 
outcome and selected secondary outcomes (depression and anxiety scores, 
exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 months postnatal to evaluate if the improvements 
are sustained in the longer-term. We are especially interested in sustained 
improvement (recovery) from major depressive episode.
DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
a technology-assisted peer-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy-based 
intervention in rural Pakistan. If shown to be effective, the novel delivery 
format could play a role in reducing the treatment gap for perinatal depression 
and other common mental disorders in LMIC.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05353491) 
on 29 April 2022.

Computerized mental health interventions have the potential to address existing 
mental health care disparities in rural communities. The aim of this study was 
to conduct an exploratory examination on the acceptability of an interactive 
computerized cognitive behavior therapy program to reduce depressive symptoms 
for adults in a rural Western state. Partnering with the land-grant university 
Extension system and a state non-profit organization, we identified and 
interviewed 18 key informants and conducted 19 focus groups in 15 rural 
communities to ascertain attitudes and perspectives about the program. Key 
informants were provided access to the Thrive program prior to the interviews. 
Focus group participants were provided a brief demonstration of the program and 
asked to provide feedback. Content analyses of interview and focus group 
transcripts yielded four general themes of program acceptability: privacy, 
accessibility, user-friendliness, and cultural inappropriateness. Overall, 
participants indicated that the Thrive program would be useful for many in their 
communities. They also reported that the program could be improved by making 
videos that better represent rural community members' lifestyles and 
experiences. The study team members acted on these findings to improve the 
Thrive program for rural Western populations.

BACKGROUND: Social distancing is a crucial intervention to slow down 
person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. However, social distancing has 
negative consequences, including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital 
interventions, such as text messaging, can provide accessible support on a 
population-wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help 
individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 
pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the 
effect of our 60-day text messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess 
whether the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content 
improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the 
differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time 
windows.
METHODS: The messages were designed within two different categories: behavioral 
activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into (1) a random 
messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal 
probabilities, and (2) a reinforcement learning arm, with a learned decision 
mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one 
message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide 
their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood 
ratings; self-reported depression, using the 8-item Patient Health 
Questionnaire; and self-reported anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder scale at baseline and at intervention completion.
RESULTS: The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of 
California Berkeley approved this study in April 2020 (No. 2020-04-13162). Data 
collection began in April 2020 and will run to April 2021. As of August 24, 
2020, we have enrolled 229 participants. We plan to submit manuscripts 
describing the main results of the trial and results from the microrandomized 
trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and for presentations at 
national and international scientific meetings.
CONCLUSIONS: Results will contribute to our knowledge of effective psychological 
tools to alleviate the negative effects of social distancing and the benefit of 
using machine learning to personalize digital mental health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown a high prevalence of depression during pregnancy, 
and there is also evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the 
most effective psychosocial interventions. Emerging evidence from randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that technology has been successfully 
harnessed to provide CBT interventions for other populations. However, very few 
studies have focused on their use during pregnancy. This approach has become 
increasingly important in many clinical areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
our study aimed to expand the knowledge in this particular clinical area.
OBJECTIVE: Our systematic review aimed to bring together the available 
research-based evidence on digitalized CBT interventions for depression symptoms 
during pregnancy.
METHODS: A systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, 
ClinicalTrials.gov, and EBSCO Open Dissertations databases was carried out from 
the earliest available evidence to October 27, 2021. Only RCT studies published 
in English were considered. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed, and the protocol was 
registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The risk of bias 
was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.
RESULTS: The review identified 7 studies from 5 countries (the United States, 
China, Australia, Norway, and Sweden) published from 2015 to 2021. The sample 
sizes ranged from 25 to 1342 participants. The interventions used various 
technological elements, including text, images, videos, games, interactive 
features, and peer group discussions. They comprised 2 guided and 5 unguided 
approaches. Using digitalized CBT interventions for depression during pregnancy 
showed promising efficacy, with guided intervention showing higher effect sizes 
(Hedges g=1.21) than the unguided interventions (Hedges g=0.14-0.99). The 
acceptability of the digitalized CBT interventions was highly encouraging, based 
on user feedback. Attrition rates were low for the guided intervention (4.5%) 
but high for the unguided interventions (22.1%-46.5%). A high overall risk of 
bias was present for 6 of the 7 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our search only identified a small number of digitalized CBT 
interventions for pregnant women, despite the potential of this approach. These 
showed promising evidence when it came to efficacy and positive outcomes for 
depression symptoms, and user feedback was positive. However, the overall risk 
of bias suggests that the efficacy of the interventions needs to be interpreted 
with caution. Future studies need to consider how to mitigate these sources of 
biases. Digitalized CBT interventions can provide prompt, effective, 
evidence-based interventions for pregnant women. This review increases our 
understanding of the importance of digitalized interventions during pregnancy, 
including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in information technology and telecommunications have 
resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of mobile devices and the internet to 
enhance and facilitate access to treatment. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is 
an empirically based treatment that is well suited for enhancement by new 
technologies, particularly with youth. To facilitate the dissemination of this 
evidence-based treatment, we developed a technology-enhanced CBT intervention 
for the treatment of adolescent depression consisting of (1) online therapist 
training (2) in-session use of tablets for teaching clients CBT concepts and 
skills, and (3) text messaging for between session homework reminders and 
self-monitoring.
METHODS: Eighteen licensed clinicians (social workers n = 7, psychologists 
n = 9) were randomized to have their patients receive either the intervention 
(CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Each clinician treated four adolescents for 
12 weeks. Clinicians in the CBT arm completed an online tutorial on CBT 
treatment of adolescent depression, then received an iPad with access to patient 
education materials for teaching CBT concepts to patients during sessions. 
Individualized text messages were integrated into treatment for homework 
reminders, support, and outcomes measurement. Outcome measures included a 
49-item multiple choice test for tutorial effectiveness; the system usability 
scale (SUS) for user satisfaction; quick inventory of depressive 
symptomatology-adolescent version (QIDS-A-Pat); and clinician and patient 
ratings on the therapeutic alliance scale for adolescents (TASA).
RESULTS: A significant increase in knowledge of CBT concepts was found after 
completing the tutorial, t(8) = 7.02, p < 0.001. Clinician and patient ratings 
of user satisfaction were high for both the iPad teaching tools, and the text 
messaging. Ninety-five percent of teens said reviewing their text messages with 
their therapist was helpful, and all said they would use text messaging in 
treatment again. Ratings of the therapeutic alliance were higher in the CBT arm 
t(131) = 4.03, p = 0.001. A significant reduction in depression was found in 
both groups [t(34) = 8.453, p < 0.001 and t(29) = 6.67, p < 0.001 for CBT and 
TAU, respectively). Clinical ratings of improvement were greater on all outcome 
measures for the CBT arm; however, none reached statistical significance. Effect 
sizes (Cohen's d) ranged from small (QIDS-A) to large (TASA).
CONCLUSIONS: Results support the feasibility of this technology-enhanced CBT 
intervention as a means of improving CBT treatment of adolescent depression and 
may help address the critical shortage of therapists trained on empirically 
based treatments.

This narrative review of the literature provides a summary and discussion of 
25 years of research into the complex links between depression and diabetes. 
Systematic reviews have shown that depression occurs more frequently in people 
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with people without diabetes. Currently, 
it remains unclear whether depression is also more common in people with 
impaired glucose metabolism or undiagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with people 
without diabetes. More prospective epidemiological research into the course of 
depression and an exploration of mechanisms in individuals with diabetes are 
needed. Depression in diabetes is associated with less optimal self-care 
behaviours, suboptimal glycaemic control, impaired quality of life, incident 
micro- and macrovascular diseases, and elevated mortality rates. Randomized 
controlled trails concluded that depression in diabetes can be treated with 
antidepressant medication, cognitive-behavioural therapy (individual, 
group-based or web-based), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and stepped care. 
Although big strides forward have been made in the past 25 years, scientific 
evidence about depression in diabetes remains incomplete. Future studies should 
investigate mechanisms that link both conditions and test new diabetes-specific 
web- or app-based interventions for depression in diabetes. It is important to 
determine whether treatment or prevention of depression prevents future diabetes 
complications and lowers mortality rates.

Text messaging interventions are increasingly used to help people manage 
depression and anxiety. However, little is known about the effectiveness and 
implementation of these interventions among U.S. Latinxs, who often face 
barriers to using mental health tools. The StayWell at Home (StayWell) 
intervention, a 60-day text messaging program based on cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT), was developed to help adults cope with depressive and anxiety 
symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. StayWell users (n = 398) received daily 
mood inquiries and automated skills-based text messages delivering CBT-informed 
coping strategies from an investigator-generated message bank. We conduct a 
Hybrid Type 1 mixed-methods study to compare the effectiveness and 
implementation of StayWell for Latinx and Non-Latinx White (NLW) adults using 
the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) 
framework. Effectiveness was measured using the PHQ-8 depression and GAD-7 
anxiety scales, assessed before starting and after completing StayWell. Guided 
by RE-AIM, we conducted a thematic text analysis of responses to an open-ended 
question about user experiences to help contextualize quantitative findings. 
Approximately 65.8% (n = 262) of StayWell users completed pre-and-post surveys. 
On average, depressive (-1.48, p = 0.001) and anxiety (-1.38, p = 0.001) 
symptoms decreased from pre-to-post StayWell. Compared to NLW users (n = 192), 
Latinx users (n = 70) reported an additional -1.45 point (p < 0.05) decline in 
depressive symptoms, adjusting for demographics. Although Latinxs reported 
StayWell as relatively less useable (76.8 vs. 83.9, p = 0.001) than NLWs, they 
were more interested in continuing the program (7.5 vs. 6.2 out of 10, p = 
0.001) and recommending it to a family member/friend (7.8 vs. 7.0 out of 10, p = 
0.01). Based on the thematic analysis, both Latinx and NLW users enjoyed 
responding to mood inquiries and sought bi-directional, personalized text 
messages and texts with links to more information to resources. Only NLW users 
stated that StayWell provided no new information than they already knew from 
therapy or other sources. In contrast, Latinx users suggested that engagement 
with a behavioral provider through text or support groups would be beneficial, 
highlighting this group's unmet need for behavioral health care. mHealth 
interventions like StayWell are well-positioned to address population-level 
disparities by serving those with the greatest unmet needs if they are 
culturally adapted and actively disseminated to marginalized groups. TRIAL

BACKGROUND: Homebound older adults are a high-risk group for depression. 
However, many of them face barriers to accessing evidence-supported mental 
health treatments. Digital mental health interventions can potentially improve 
treatment access, but few web-based interventions are explicitly tailored for 
depression in older adults.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the development process of Empower@Home, a 
web-delivered intervention for depression in homebound older adults that is 
based on cognitive behavioral therapy, and reports on the outcomes of usability 
studies.
METHODS: Empower@Home was developed in collaboration with community agencies, 
stakeholders, and older adults, guided by user-centered design principles. User 
needs were assessed through secondary data analysis, demographic and health 
profiles from administrative data, and interviews and surveys of community 
partners. A comparative usability evaluation was conducted with 10 older adults 
to assess the usability of Empower@Home compared to 2 similar programs. Field 
testing was conducted with 4 end users to detect additional usability issues.
RESULTS: Feedback and recommendations from community partners heavily influenced 
the content and design of Empower@Home. The intervention consists of 9 sessions, 
including psychoeducation and an introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy 
skills and tools through short video clips, in-session exercises, an animated 
storyline, and weekly out-of-session home practice. A printed workbook 
accompanies the web-based lessons. In comparative usability testing (N=10), 
Empower@Home received a System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 7.4), which was 
significantly higher than the 2 comparator programs (t9=3.28; P=.005 and 
t9=2.78; P=.011). Most participants, 80% (n=8), preferred Empower@Home over the 
comparators. In the longitudinal field test (n=4), all participants reported 
liking the program procedures and feeling confident in performing 
program-related tasks. The single-subject line graph showed an overall downward 
trend in their depression scores over time, offering an encouraging indication 
of the intervention's potential effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration with community stakeholders and careful consideration 
of potential implementation issues during the design process can result in more 
usable, engaging, and effective digital mental health interventions.

PURPOSE: Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) reduces breast cancer morbidity and 
mortality; however, adherence is suboptimal. Interventions exist, yet few have 
improved adherence. Patient characteristics may alter uptake of an intervention 
to boost adherence. We examined moderators of the effect of a virtual 
intervention (STRIDE; #NCT03837496) on AET adherence after breast cancer.
METHODS: At a large academic medical center, patients taking AET (N = 100; 
Mage = 56.1, 91% White) were randomized to receive STRIDE versus medication 
monitoring. All stored their medication in digital pill bottles (MEMS Caps) 
which captured objective adherence. Participants self-reported adherence 
(Medication Adherence Report Scale) at 12 weeks post-baseline. Moderators 
included age, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale), AET-related symptom distress (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom 
Scale), and AET-specific concerns (Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire). We 
used hierarchical linear modeling (time × condition × moderator) and multiple 
regression (condition × moderator) to test the interaction effects on adherence.
RESULTS: Age (B = 0.05, SE = 0.02, p = 0.003) and AET-related symptom distress 
(B = -0.04, SE = 0.02, p = 0.02) moderated condition effect on self-reported 
adherence while anxiety (B = -1.20, SE = 0.53, p = 0.03) and depressive symptoms 
(B = -1.65, SE = 0.65, p = 0.01) moderated objective adherence effects. 
AET-specific concerns approached significance (B = 0.91, SE = 0.57, p = 0.12). 
Participants who received STRIDE and were older or presented with lower anxiety 
and depressive symptoms or AET-related symptom distress exhibited improved 
adherence. Post hoc analyses revealed high correlations among most moderators.
CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients who received STRIDE exhibited improvements 
in AET adherence. The interrelatedness of moderators suggests an underlying 
profile of patients with lower symptom burden who benefitted most from the 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent condition in Australia that increases the 
risk of depression and anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behaviour therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-i) is the recommended 'first line' treatment but is accessed by a 
minority of people with insomnia.
AIMS: To improve CBT-i access in Australia, we aimed to develop and test a 
self-guided interactive digital CBT-i program.
METHODS: An online randomised controlled trial was conducted from August 2022 to 
August 2023 to investigate the effect of digital CBT-i, versus digital sleep 
education control, on symptoms of insomnia (ISI), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety 
(GAD-7), fatigue, sleepiness and maladaptive beliefs about sleep at 8-week 
follow-up. The control group accessed the intervention after the 8-week 
follow-up. Questionnaires were additionally administered at 16 and 24 weeks. 
Intent-to-treat mixed models and complete-case chi-squared analyses were used.
RESULTS: Participants included 62 adults with insomnia symptoms (age M (SD) 
= 52.5 (16.3), 82% female, ISI = 18.6 (2.9)). There were no between-group 
differences in baseline characteristics or missing 8-week data (14.5%). After 
adjusting for baseline scores, CBT-i was associated with lower insomnia (Diffadj 
(95% CI) = 7.32 (5.0-9.6), P < 0.001, d = 1.64), depression (3.36 (1.3-5.4), p 
= 0.002, d = 0.84), fatigue (5.2 (2.5-7.9), P < 0.001, d = 1.00) and maladaptive 
beliefs about sleep (11.0 (4.1-18.0), P = 0.002, d = 0.82), but not anxiety 
symptoms at 8 weeks (1.84 (-0.1 to 3.8), p = 0.060, d = 0.50). Compared to 
control, CBT-i was associated with greater rates of insomnia remission (ISI <8; 
0.0%, vs 40.0%, P < 0.001) and response at 8 weeks (ISI reduction ≥6; 7.1% vs 
72.0%, P < 0.001). Improvements in insomnia and depression were maintained at 
24 weeks in the CBT-i group.
CONCLUSIONS: This interactive digital CBT-i program resulted in large and 
sustained improvements in symptoms of insomnia, depression, fatigue and 
maladaptive beliefs about sleep in Australian adults with insomnia symptoms. 
Implementation programs are required to increase digital CBT-i access and 
uptake.

BACKGROUND: Sleep hygiene is important for maintaining good sleep and reducing 
insomnia.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app 
(including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior [TPB], 
health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene 
among insomnia patients.
METHODS: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled 
trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group that 
used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n=156) or a control group 
that received only patient education (PE, n=156) through the app. Outcomes were 
assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postintervention. 
Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary 
outcomes included attitudes toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral 
control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring, 
behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were 
used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in outcomes between the two groups and 
across time.
RESULTS: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE 
group (P=.02 at 1 month, P=.04 at 3 months, and P=.02 at 6 months) as were sleep 
quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived 
behavioral control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with 
self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of the 
intervention on outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers might consider using a CBT-I app to improve 
sleep among insomnia patients.

INTRODUCTION: Previous evidence suggested that online self-guided sleep 
intervention is efficacious in improving treatment outcomes in patients with 
chronic insomnia [corrected]. However, research on online sleep interventions 
targeting acute insomnia [corrected] has been scarce. This study aims to 
evaluate the effectiveness of brief e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy for 
insomnia (eCBTI) in preventing transition from acute insomnia to chronic 
insomnia [corrected].
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic two-arm multicentre, randomised 
controlled trial comparing eCBTI with treatment as usual (TAU) in outpatients. 
Two hundred patients with acute insomnia [corrected] (as defined by DSM-5) will 
be recruited. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive 1 week eCBTI via a 
Smartphone application, or to receive TAU. Treatment effects will be assessed at 
1 week and 3 months after intervention. The primary outcome of the study, 
whether the eCBTI program is sufficient in preventing transition from short-term 
to chronic insomnia [corrected], is measured by the Insomnia Severity Index. 
Secondary outcome measurements include the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes 
about Sleep Scale, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, Sleep Hygiene and 
Practices Scale, Pre-sleep Arousal Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. 
Additionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Short-Form 
12-Item Health Survey will be used for measurement of mood symptoms and quality 
of life.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from 
the Ethics Committee of Southern Medical University (reference number: 
NFEC-2017-131). The results of the investigation will be published in scientific 
papers. The data from the investigation will be made available online if 
necessary.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia and depression are highly comorbid and mutually exacerbate 
clinical trajectories and outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) effectively reduces both insomnia and depression severity, and can be 
delivered digitally. This could substantially increase the accessibility to 
CBT-I, which could reduce the health disparities related to insomnia; however, 
the efficacy of digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) across a range of demographic groups has 
not yet been adequately examined. This randomized placebo-controlled trial 
examined the efficacy of dCBT-I in reducing both insomnia and depression across 
a wide range of demographic groups.
METHODS: Of 1358 individuals with insomnia randomized, a final sample of 358 
were retained in the dCBT-I condition and 300 in the online sleep education 
condition. Severity of insomnia and depression was examined as a dependent 
variable. Race, socioeconomic status (SES; household income and education), 
gender, and age were also tested as independent moderators of treatment effects.
RESULTS: The dCBT-I condition yielded greater reductions in both insomnia and 
depression severity than sleep education, with significantly higher rates of 
remission following treatment. Demographic variables (i.e. income, race, sex, 
age, education) were not significant moderators of the treatment effects, 
suggesting that dCBT-I is comparably efficacious across a wide range of 
demographic groups. Furthermore, while differences in attrition were found based 
on SES, attrition did not differ between white and black participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence that the wide dissemination of dCBT-I may 
effectively target both insomnia and comorbid depression across a wide spectrum 
of the population.

BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine use can be associated with involvement with 
correctional services and incarceration. Traditionally, treatments for 
methamphetamine use have been delivered in-person - however, lockdowns initiated 
during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced access to such in-person 
support in prisons. Therefore, in May 2020 a digital cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT) program for substance use disorders - 'Breaking Free from 
Substance Abuse' - was made available across prisons in Ohio in order to meet 
this treatment gap. This represents the first time this digital CBT intervention 
has been made widely available to incarcerated people residing in prisons or 
jails in the United States (US). This was a within-subjects study using data 
from 2187 Ohio prison residents who engaged with this digital CBT program to 
address their methamphetamine use.
RESULTS: Participants reported multiple psychosocial risk factors, including 
moderate to severe substance dependence, depression and anxiety; interpersonal 
conflict; aggressive behavior; paranoia; and difficulties with work, education 
and accommodation. Significant reductions in substance dependence, 
depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial impairment, and improvements in quality 
of life, were identified in the sample. Risk factors were associated with less 
positive outcomes, specifically interpersonal conflict and poor mental health. 
Completion of specific components of the program were associated with more 
positive outcomes - a dose response was also identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBT can be delivered in secure US correctional settings and 
may help to fill unmet needs for in-person treatment. Specifically, this digital 
CBT program may support incarcerated individuals to address methamphetamine use, 
with outcomes being associated with psychosocial risk factors and program 
engagement.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, exponential growth in digital innovations and 
internet access has provided opportunities to deliver health services at a much 
greater scale than previously possible. Evidence-based technology-enabled 
interventions can provide cost-effective, accessible, and resource-efficient 
solutions for addressing mental health issues. This study evaluated the first 
year of a supported digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) service provided 
by the national health service in Ireland, which has been accessible to 
individuals who receive a referral from one of five referring groups: General 
Practitioners, Primary Care Psychology, Counselling Primary Care, Community 
Mental Health, and Jigsaw (a nationwide youth mental health service).
METHODS: A retrospective, observational study examining data from the service 
between April 2021 to April 2022 was conducted. Descriptive statistics on 
referrals, account activations, user demographics, program usage, and user 
satisfaction were extracted, and pre-to-post clinical outcomes for depression 
measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and for anxiety measured by the 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 were analysed using linear mixed effect models.
RESULTS: There were 5,298 referrals and 3,236 (61%) account activations within 
the year. Most users were female (72.9%) and aged between 18 and 44 years 
(75.4%). The CBT programs were associated with significant reductions in both 
depression (β = 3.34, 95% CI [3.03, 3.65], p < 0.001) and anxiety (β = 3.64, 95% 
CI [3.36, 3.93], p < 0.001), with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8). Time 
spent using the programs was also found to be a predictor of the variability in 
these clinical outcomes (p < 0.001), and accounting for this resulted in 
significantly better model fits (p < 0.001). User satisfaction ratings were also 
very high, exceeding 94%.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve the representation of male and older adult users 
are warranted. However, overall, the results demonstrate how digital CBT can be 
provided at scale and lead to symptom reductions with large effect sizes for 
patients seeking help for depression and anxiety. The findings substantiate the 
continued use and expansion of this service in Ireland and the more widespread 
implementation of similar services in other international public healthcare 
settings.

Functional neurological disorders (FND) are an important source of healthcare 
utilization and morbidity. While there are no formal guidelines for treating 
these disorders, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is emerging as a safe and 
effective treatment. Currently, there is a global shortage of CBT providers, 
with only a small subset trained in and comfortable with treating patients with 
FND. We highlight four types of remote CBT delivery to patients with FND to 
alleviate the access obstacle: workbooks, internet-guided CBT, app-based CBT, 
and teletherapy. CBT workbooks and teletherapy have been studied in FND, with 
preliminary studies suggesting efficacy; internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT 
have not but have been effectively used in patients with psychiatric disorders, 
particularly depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic disorders. As these 
disorders are often comorbid and share overlapping neurobiology with FND, 
internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT represent promising delivery options of 
CBT for FND. Although remotely-delivered CBT is unlikely to replace in-person 
CBT and there are technical and logistical challenges to overcome prior to 
widespread deployment, it holds promise as an adjunct treatment when in-person 
CBT is inaccessible. We propose a rational approach to future allocation of 
remote CBT treatment options and highlight important research gaps to bridge 
beforehand.

BACKGROUND: Many digital mental health interventions meet low levels of use. 
However, current use measurement methods do not necessarily help identify which 
intervention elements are associated with dropout, despite this information 
potentially facilitating iterative intervention development. Here, we suggest 
improving the comprehensiveness of intervention use measurement with the user 
journey method, which evaluates every intervention element to identify 
intervention-specific use barriers.
METHODS: We applied user journey method in a clinical trial that investigated 
the efficacy of a novel game-based intervention, Meliora, for adult Major 
Depressive Disorder. We modelled the intervention for its four technological 
(Recruitment, Website, Questionnaires, Intervention Software) and two 
interpersonal elements (Assessment, Support). We then applied the user journey 
method to measure how many users proceeded from one element to the next 
combining social media analytics, website use data, signup data, clinical 
subject coordinator interview data, symptom questionnaire data, and behavioral 
intervention use data. These measurements were complemented with the qualitative 
analysis of the study discovery sources and email support contacts.
RESULTS: Recruitment: The intervention recruitment reached at least 145,000 
Finns, with social media, word-of-mouth, and news and web sources being the most 
effective recruitment channels. Website: The study website received 16,243 
visitors, which led to 1,007 sign-ups.
ASSESSMENT: 895 participants were assessed and 735 were accepted. Intervention 
Software: 498 participants were assigned to the active intervention or 
comparator, of whom 457 used them at least once: on average, for 17.3 h 
(SD = 20.4 h) on 19.7 days (SD = 20.7 d) over a period of 38.9 days (SD = 31.2 
d). The 28 intervention levels were associated with an average dropout rate of 
2.6%, with two sections exhibiting an increase against this baseline. 150 
participants met the minimum adherence goal of 24 h use. Questionnaires: 116 
participants completed the post-intervention questionnaire.
SUPPORT: 313 signed-up participants contacted the researchers via email.
CONCLUSION: The user journey method allowed for the comprehensive evaluation of 
the six intervention elements, and enabled identifying use barriers expediting 
iterative intervention development and implementation.

INTRODUCTION: Difficulties in emotional regulation are key to the development 
and maintenance of chronic pain. Recent evidence shows internet-delivered 
dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional 
dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide 
more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the 
chronic pain population.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple 
baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills 
training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation 
and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention 
encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain 
sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). 
Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to 
different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, 
participants will receive six 60-90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 
5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from 
the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain 
app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby 
the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional 
regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the 
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary 
outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation 
measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping 
behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are 
increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological 
interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual 
variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the University of New South 
Wales (HC200199). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to 
mental health care and has proven efficacious. However, this approach currently 
exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is 
a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health 
systems by initiating iCBT and "stepping up" care to a more intensive 
intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment 
factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving 
iCBT. This exploratory analysis of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized 
trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if 
they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on 
stepping were examined using Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of 
the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week treatment 
period. Only pre-treatment depression severity and treatment preference were 
associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, 
respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for 
iCBT as an effective, low intensity treatment for depression. The modest 
association of pre-treatment depression and preference to not receive iCBT may 
be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond.

Digital devices play a significant role in the learning and living of children 
and adolescents, whose overuse or addiction has become a global concern. This 
scoping review seeks to synthesize existing studies to investigate relevant 
interventions and their effects on digital addiction in children (ages 0-18). To 
understand the latest advances, we have identified 17 studies published in 
international peer-reviewed journals between 2018-2022. The findings revealed 
that, first, most interventions for digital addiction in children and 
adolescents were cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) or CBT-based 
interventions, which could improve anxiety, depression, and related symptoms of 
digital addiction. Second, rather than directly targeting addictive behaviors, 
some family-based interventions aim to strengthen family functions and 
relationships. Finally, digital-based interventions, such as website-based, 
application-based, and virtual reality interventions, are promising in 
adolescent digital addiction interventions. However, these studies shared the 
same limitations: small sample sizes, short intervention durations, no control 
group, and nonrandomized assignments. The small sample size problem is difficult 
to solve by offline intervention. Meanwhile, online digital-based intervention 
is still in its infancy, resulting in limited generalizability of the findings 
and the inability to popularize digital intervention. Accordingly, future 
intervention studies should integrate various assessments and interventions to 
form an integrated platform to provide interventions for addicted children and 
adolescents worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Patients with obesity often experience psychological distress, 
specifically depression symptoms. Due to various barriers, such as limitations 
of healthcare offers, digital interventions, for example medical apps, can 
provide a suitable approach to support affected people. In the envisaged 
prospective randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the efficacy of the 
LightMood intervention. The LightMood intervention is a manualized and 
user-centered, digital intervention for patients with obesity, with a duration 
of 4 months, which contains elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and 
mindfulness-based and skills-based exercises. We expect the LightMood 
intervention to be superior to treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of reducing 
depression symptoms.
METHODS: The trial incorporates four distinct measurement time points: the 
baseline assessment, the post-treatment assessment, and 1- and 3-month follow-up 
assessments. Furthermore, we implemented in-treatment assessments for both 
groups. Participants will be randomized into two groups (LightMood intervention 
vs TAU). The aim is to include 128 participants (64 per group) in the study. 
Inclusion criteria are patients who are obese, at least 18 years old, with a 
private Internet access, and with adequate digital literacy and show depression 
symptoms (PHQ ≥ 10). Exclusion criteria are weekly outpatient individual 
psychotherapy, obesity surgery within the last year or planned within the next 7 
months, no private Internet access, and the prescription of a new psychotropic 
drug within the last 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the post-assessment 
reduction in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include the 
improvement in self-efficacy, quality of life, mindfulness, reduction in eating 
disorder symptoms, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we expect a positive 
development of depression symptoms throughout the different time points (T1, T2, 
and T3) in patients with obesity.
DISCUSSION: LightMood is an evidence-based, efficient, low-threshold online 
intervention that aims to reduce depression symptoms in people with obesity. 
Online interventions could offer a promising alternative to conventional 
face-to-face therapy. The primary objective of the current study is to add 
essential insight into the feasibility, efficacy, effectiveness, and acceptance 
of e-mental health interventions for people with obesity and depression 
symptoms.

Adherence to physical activity in patients with serious heart disease is 
critical to recovery and survival. In-person programs to promote activity in 
cardiac patients have been poorly attended, and increasingly patients are 
focused on mobile, self-management-based approaches to health. Accordingly, we 
completed a one-arm trial of a novel one-way 14-day text message intervention 
among 40 patients with a prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The two-pronged 
psychological-behavioral intervention alternated daily messages focused on 
promoting psychological well-being with messages providing specific 
education/advice regarding physical activity. All messages were successfully 
transmitted, and nearly all participants found the intervention to be helpful 
(n=37; 92.5%) and performed at least one specific health-related action in 
response to a text message (n=35; 87.5%). Post-intervention, participants had 
improvements in happiness (Cohen's d=0.25), determination (d=0.37), depression 
(d=-0.01), and anxiety (d=-0.13), though not optimism. Moreover, participants 
reported an increase in moderate physical activity of 105 minutes/week 
(baseline: 261 [SD 265] minutes/week, follow-up: 366 [SD 519]; d=0.25). These 
improvements were largely maintained two weeks later, with further increases in 
physical activity (414 [SD 570] minutes/week). Text messaging focused on 
well-being and physical activity was well-accepted and associated with 
improvements in activity and mental health in this high-risk clinical 
population.

PURPOSE: Insomnia has adverse effects on people with epilepsy. We aimed to test 
a novel cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app-based intervention 
on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy 
and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors.
METHODS: Participants were recruited from neurology clinics in Iran and 
comprised individuals diagnosed with epilepsy and having moderate to severe 
insomnia. A two-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, consisting of a 
treatment group (CBT-I; n = 160) and control group (patient education; n = 160). 
Primary outcomes were self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep 
hygiene behavior and objective sleep characteristics measured by actigraphy. 
Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, 
action planning, coping planning, behavioral automaticity, self-monitoring, 
anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). All outcomes were measured at 
baseline, and at one, three, and six months postintervention, except objective 
sleep, which was assessed at baseline, and one and six months postintervention. 
Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Current findings showed that sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep 
hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency were significantly improved in the 
CBT-I group compared with the patient education group at all measurement points. 
Also, the CBT-I group had significantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL 
compared with the patient education group. Mediation analyses showed that 
attitude, intention, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral 
automaticity significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Results support the use of the CBT-I app to improve sleep outcomes 
among people with epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 30% of people with long-term physical health 
conditions (LTCs) experience mental health problems, with negative consequences 
and costs for individuals and healthcare services. Access to psychological 
treatment is scarce and, when available, often focuses on treating primary 
mental health problems rather than illness-related anxiety/depression. The aim 
of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a newly developed, 
therapist-supported, digital cognitive-behavioural treatment (COMPASS) for 
reducing LTC-related psychological distress (anxiety/depression), compared with 
standard charity support (SCS).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial (1:1 
ratio) with nested qualitative study will be conducted. Two-hundred adults with 
LTC-related anxiety and depression will be recruited through national LTC 
charities. They will be randomly allocated to receive COMPASS or SCS only. An 
independent administrator will use Qualtrics randomiser for treatment 
allocation, to ensure allocation concealment. Participants will access treatment 
from home over 10 weeks. The COMPASS group will have access to the digital 
programme and six therapist contacts: one welcome message and five fortnightly 
phone calls. Data will be collected online at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks 
post-randomisation for primary outcome (Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and 
Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, daily 
functioning, COVID-19-related distress, illness-related distress, quality of 
life, knowledge and confidence for illness self-management, symptom severity and 
improvement). Analyses will be conducted following the intention-to-treat 
principle by a data analyst blinded to treatment allocation. A purposively 
sampled group of COMPASS participants and therapists will be interviewed. 
Interviews will be thematically analysed.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by King's College London's 
Psychiatry, Nursing and Midwifery Research Ethics Subcommittee (reference: 
LRS-19/20-20347). All participants will provide informed consent to take part if 
eligible. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at 
conferences.

Utilization of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for 
treating depression and anxiety disorders in stepped-care models, such as the 
UK's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), is a potential solution 
for addressing the treatment gap in mental health. We investigated the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT when fully integrated within IAPT 
stepped-care settings. We conducted an 8-week pragmatic randomized controlled 
trial with a 2:1 (iCBT intervention: waiting-list) allocation, for participants 
referred to an IAPT Step 2 service with depression and anxiety symptoms (Trial 
registration: ISRCTN91967124). The primary outcomes measures were PHQ-9 
(depressive symptoms) and GAD-7 (anxiety symptoms) and WSAS (functional 
impairment) as a secondary outcome. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on 
EQ-5D-5L (preference-based health status) to elicit the quality-adjust life year 
(QALY) and a modified-Client Service Receipt Inventory (care resource-use). 
Diagnostic interviews were administered at baseline and 3 months. Three-hundred 
and sixty-one participants were randomized (iCBT, 241; waiting-list, 120). 
Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant interaction effects for the PHQ-9 
(b = -2.75, 95% CI -4.00, -1.50) and GAD-7 (b = -2.79, 95% CI -4.00, -1.58) in 
favour of iCBT at 8-week and further improvements observed up to 12-months. Over 
8-weeks the probability of cost-effectiveness was 46.6% if decision makers are 
willing to pay £30,000 per QALY, increasing to 91.2% when the control-arm's 
outcomes and costs were extrapolated over 12-months. Results indicate that iCBT 
for depression and anxiety is effective and potentially cost-effective in the 
long-term within IAPT. Upscaling the use of iCBT as part of stepped care could 
help to enhance IAPT outcomes. The pragmatic trial design supports the 
ecological validity of the findings.

OBJECTIVE: To appraise the quality and usability of currently available pain 
applications that could be used by community-dwelling older adults to 
self-manage their arthritic pain.
METHODS: A systematic review. Searches were conducted in App Store and Google 
Play to identify pain self-management apps relevant to arthritic pain 
management. English language pain management apps providing pain assessment and 
documentation function and pain management education were considered for 
inclusion. A quality evaluation audit tool based on the Stanford Arthritis 
Self-Management Program was developed a priori to evaluate app content quality. 
The usability of included apps was assessed using an established usability 
evaluation tool.
RESULTS: Out of the 373 apps that were identified, four met the inclusion 
criteria. The included apps all included a pain assessment and documentation 
function and instructions on medication use, communication with health 
professionals, cognitive behavioral therapy-based pain management, and physical 
exercise. Management of mood, depression, anxiety, and sleep were featured in 
most apps (N = 3). Three-quarters (N = 3) of the apps fell below the acceptable 
moderate usability score (≥3), while one app obtained a moderate score (3.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Few of the currently available pain apps offer a comprehensive pain 
self-management approach incorporating evidence-based strategies in accordance 
with the Stanford Arthritis Self-Management Program. The moderate-level 
usability across the included apps indicates a need to consider the usability 
needs of the older population in future pain self-management app development 
endeavors.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in 
improving depression in patients with cancer. However, diversity exists in the 
CBT delivery formats, and the optimal delivery format remains unconfirmed.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of different delivery formats of CBT 
interventions on depression in patients with cancer.
DESIGN: Network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
DATA SOURCE: Six databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, 
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PsycINFO, were searched 
from inception to May 30, 2024.
METHODS: Two reviewers independently conducted study inclusion, data extraction, 
and risk of bias assessment. A pairwise meta-analysis and a network 
meta-analysis were performed sequentially to determine the efficacy of CBT 
delivery formats for improving depression in patients with cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 34 randomized controlled trials involving six delivery 
formats of CBT were included. Face-to-face group CBT (SMD = -0.88, 95% CI 
[-1.33, -0.44]), internet-based individual CBT (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.92, 
-0.06]), app-based individual CBT (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI [-1.45, -0.18]), and 
combined delivery formats of CBT for individual (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI [-0.62, 
-0.09]) were significantly more effective than the inactive control. The ranking 
probabilities revealed that face-to-face group CBT (P-score = 0.86), app-based 
individual CBT (P-score = 0.74) and internet-based individual CBT 
(P-score = 0.57) were the three most effective delivery formats of CBT.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the efficacy ranking of different CBT delivery 
formats in improving depression in patients with cancer. These findings are 
expected to provide evidence-based support for future research and clinical 
decision making for improving depression in patients with cancer.

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review evaluated exergame interventions' efficacy in 
older adults, focusing on depressive symptoms, activities of daily living 
(ADLs), and fear of falling.
METHODS: We searched five electronic databases from inception to June 2024. Data 
were synthesized using the inverse-variance method, reporting standardized mean 
differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,128 participants 
were included. Exergames significantly improved depressive symptoms 
(SMD = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.11 to -0.40, p < .001). Meta-regression showed no 
influence of sample size, health status, intervention duration, gender, or 
gaming device. No significant effects were found for ADLs (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI: 
-0.75 to 0.76, p = .988) or fear of falling (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.40 to 0.08, 
p = .189).
CONCLUSIONS: Exergames enhance mental health in older adults but lack clear 
effects on physical function or fear of falling. High-quality, long-term studies 
are needed.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Exergames offer an engaging intervention to reduce 
depressive symptoms, complementing mental health therapies. Clinicians should 
use modern platforms and combine exergames with physical or behavioral 
interventions to address ADLs and fear of falling.

Many mental health disorders emerge in late childhood and early adolescence and 
contribute to the burden of these disorders among young people and later in 
life. We systematically reviewed literature published up to December 2015 to 
identify systematic reviews on mental health interventions in adolescent 
population. A total of 38 systematic reviews were included. We classified the 
included reviews into the following categories for reporting the findings: 
school-based interventions (n = 12); community-based interventions (n = 6); 
digital platforms (n = 8); and individual-/family-based interventions (n = 12). 
Evidence from school-based interventions suggests that targeted group-based 
interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective in reducing 
depressive symptoms (standard mean difference [SMD]: -.16; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: -.26 to -.05) and anxiety (SMD: -.33; 95% CI: -.59 to -.06). 
School-based suicide prevention programs suggest that classroom-based didactic 
and experiential programs increase short-term knowledge of suicide (SMD: 1.51; 
95% CI: .57-2.45) and knowledge of suicide prevention (SMD: .72; 95% CI: 
.36-1.07) with no evidence of an effect on suicide-related attitudes or 
behaviors. Community-based creative activities have some positive effect on 
behavioral changes, self-confidence, self-esteem, levels of knowledge, and 
physical activity. Evidence from digital platforms supports Internet-based 
prevention and treatment programs for anxiety and depression; however, more 
extensive and rigorous research is warranted to further establish the 
conditions. Among individual- and family-based interventions, interventions 
focusing on eating attitudes and behaviors show no impact on body mass index 
(SMD: -.10; 95% CI: -.45 to .25); Eating Attitude Test (SMD: .01; 95% CI: -.13 
to .15); and bulimia (SMD: -.03; 95% CI: -.16 to .10). Exercise is found to be 
effective in improving self-esteem (SMD: .49; 95% CI: .16-.81) and reducing 
depression score (SMD: -.66; 95% CI: -1.25 to -.08) with no impact on anxiety 
scores. Cognitive behavioral therapy compared to waitlist is effective in 
reducing remission (odds ratio: 7.85; 95% CI: 5.31-11.6). Psychological therapy 
when compared to antidepressants have comparable effect on remission, dropouts, 
and depression symptoms. The studies evaluating mental health interventions 
among adolescents were reported to be very heterogeneous, statistically, in 
their populations, interventions, and outcomes; hence, meta-analysis could not 
be conducted in most of the included reviews. Future trials should also focus on 
standardized interventions and outcomes for synthesizing the exiting body of 
knowledge. There is a need to report differential effects for gender, 
age groups, socioeconomic status, and geographic settings since the impact of 
mental health interventions might vary according to various contextual factors.

AIM: Depression in young people is common and can lead to poor long-term 
outcomes. Digital therapies are a promising means of promoting access to care. 
Currently, among the digital treatments for depression in adolescents recognized 
by the NICE guidelines, there is SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, 
X-factor), based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT. This narrative review 
aimed to evaluate: 1) Who were the depressed young people who used SPARX and 
what was their experience with the treatment? 2) Were users satisfied with the 
SPARX treatment? Did the youth's perceived level of satisfaction with using 
SPARX impact completion rates? 3) What was the role of professionals 
(researchers, consultants, teachers) in the SPARX studies? Has their support in 
running SPARX affected completion rates?
METHODS: A narrative review of the English literature was performed. The 
articles were searched in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases (from 
2012 to 2023) with keywords such as 'SPARX,' depression' and 'young adult'.
RESULTS: Of 557 papers, 18 were included in our review. The young people who 
used SPARX were students or adolescents from special help-seeker populations at 
risk or with mild to moderate depression. The highest satisfaction levels were 
present in users of primary health services, such as general practice and 
counseling services. The support of the school counselor and experts in mental 
health clinicians was instrumental in impacting user satisfaction and completion 
rates. The personalization of the game in terms of user culture - symbols, 
language, norms, values, and artifacts; the customization of the avatar, the 
gender identity; the narrative structure; the presence of a guide character 
(virtual therapist); the CBT homework seemed to represent crucial SPARX 
characteristics related to satisfaction and completion rates.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our narrative review provides an overview of the 
main results of using SPARX with interesting considerations that may suggest 
improvements for broader use and diffusion of this digital treatment.

BACKGROUND: Nearly 20% of women will be confronted with anxiety or depressive 
disorders during the perinatal period and this may lead to adverse outcomes for 
both mother and child. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the psychological 
intervention with the most empirical support for the clinical management of 
anxiety and depressive disorders. Anxiety and depression frequently occur in 
women during the perinatal period, and there is growing evidence that 
internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) could be an acceptable and effective intervention. 
THIS WAY UP, an Australian digital mental health service, has developed a 
program for postnatal anxiety and depression. This study protocol aims to 
examine the acceptability and efficacy of a French-Canadian adaptation of the 
program.
METHODS/DESIGN: The research team propose to conduct a mixed hybrid type 1 
pragmatic randomized clinical trial and implementation study to replicate the 
findings of the trial conducted in Australia by Loughnan et al. (2019), as well 
as explore barriers and facilitators to potential large-scale implementation. 
TREATMENT AND CONTROL CONDITIONS: a) postnatal anxiety and depression iCBT 
program with three lessons to complete in a six-week period, added to 
treatment-as-usual (TAU); b) TAU. Participants will include French-speaking 
women with probable postnatal depression or anxiety as per the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) or the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). 
The primary outcome measures will be the GAD-7 and the EPDS. Secondary outcome 
measures will comprise self-reported instruments to evaluate psychological 
distress, quality of life, mother-child experience, and treatment experience. 
Qualitative interviews with participants and health professionals will provide 
insights on acceptability and delivery of the iCBT program.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis will follow intent-to-treat 
principles. A mixed model regression approach will be used to account for 
between- and within-subject variations in the analysis of the effects of iCBT 
compared to TAU only intervention.
DISCUSSION: The study will generate important data of efficacy and acceptability 
to patients, clinicians, and decision-makers to inform the scaling-up of the 
postnatal iCBT intervention in Canada.

BACKGROUND: There is potential for digital mental health interventions to 
provide affordable, efficient, and scalable support to individuals. Digital 
interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, and 
mindfulness programs, have shown promise when applied in workplace settings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct an umbrella review of systematic 
reviews in order to critically evaluate, synthesize, and summarize evidence of 
various digital mental health interventions available within a workplace 
setting.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify systematic reviews 
relating to digital interventions for the workplace, using the PRISMA (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). The review protocol 
was registered in the Open Science Framework. The following databases were 
searched: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. Data 
were extracted using a predefined extraction table. To assess the methodological 
quality of a study, the AMSTAR-2 tool was used to critically appraise systematic 
reviews of health care interventions.
RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 11,875 records, which was reduced to 
14 full-text systematic literature reviews with the use of Covidence to remove 
duplicates and screen titles and abstracts. The 14 included reviews were 
published between 2014 and 2023, comprising 9 systematic reviews and 5 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses. AMSTAR-2 was used to complete a quality 
assessment of the reviews, and the results were critically low for 7 literature 
reviews and low for the other 7 literature reviews. The most common types of 
digital intervention studied were cognitive behavioral therapy, 
mindfulness/meditation, and stress management followed by other self-help 
interventions. Effectiveness of digital interventions was found for many mental 
health symptoms and conditions in employee populations, such as stress, anxiety, 
depression, burnout, and psychological well-being. Factors such as type of 
technology, guidance, recruitment, tailoring, and demographics were found to 
impact effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review aimed to critically evaluate, synthesize, and 
summarize evidence of various digital mental health interventions available 
within a workplace setting. Despite the low quality of the reviews, best 
practice guidelines can be derived from factors that impact the effectiveness of 
digital interventions in the workplace.

Up to 50% of autistic people experience co-occurring anxiety, which 
significantly impacts their quality of life. Consequently, developing new 
interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety has been 
indicated as a priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic 
community. Despite this, there are very few effective, evidence-based therapies 
available to autistic people that target anxiety; and those that are available 
(e.g., autism adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CBT) can be challenging to 
access. Thus, the current study will provide an early-stage proof of concept for 
the feasibility and acceptability of a novel app-based therapeutic approach that 
has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in 
managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. This paper describes the design and 
methodology of an ethically approved (22/LO/0291) ongoing non-randomised pilot 
trial that aims to enrol approximately 100 participants aged ≥16-years with an 
existing autism diagnosis and mild-to-severe self-reported anxiety symptoms 
(trial registration NCT05302167). Participants will be invited to engage with a 
self-guided app-based intervention-'Molehill Mountain'. Primary (Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and 
secondary outcomes (medication/ service use and Goal Attainment Scaling) will be 
assessed at baseline (Week 2 +/- 2), endpoint (Week 15 +/- 2) and three 
follow-ups (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4). Participants will also be invited to 
complete an app acceptability survey/ interview at the study endpoint. Analyses 
will address: 1) app acceptability/ useability and feasibility (via survey/ 
interview and app usage data); and 2) target population, performance of outcome 
measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention (via primary/ secondary 
outcome measures and survey/ interview)-with both objectives further informed by 
a dedicated stakeholder advisory group. The evidence from this study will inform 
the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a 
randomised-controlled trial, to provide a novel tool that can be accessed easily 
by autistic adults and may improve mental health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Digital technologies have been widely acknowledged as a potentially 
useful resource for increasing mental healthcare access. The working alliance is 
a key influence on outcomes in conventional psychotherapy, but little is known 
about therapists' experiences of forming an effective working alliance in 
blended interventions that involve in-person psychotherapy and a digital 
programme.
AIMS: To investigate psychological well-being practitioners' (PWPs') experiences 
of the working alliance in a trial of blended cognitive-behavioural therapy 
(b-CBT) for depression. Trial registration ISRCTN12388725.
METHOD: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PWPs who 
delivered b-CBT in a two-arm, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial 
investigating the effectiveness of b-CBT compared with face-to-face CBT. 
Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Participants reported four facilitating factors when building and 
maintaining a working alliance in b-CBT: having more time to deliver treatment, 
access to a wider toolkit, capacity to tailor components of b-CBT and receiving 
appropriate training and support. Participants also identified four barriers to 
building and maintaining a working alliance: time and resource constraints, 
usability challenges, limited flexibility to tailor the digital programme to 
patients' needs and lack of confidence in delivering b-CBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first specifically to investigate practitioners' 
perceived facilitators and barriers to forming a working alliance in b-CBT for 
depression. Findings suggest that PWPs' experiences of the working alliance can 
be improved by: accounting for the time required to deliver b-CBT in service 
workflows to reduce time pressures; increasing opportunities to tailor the 
digital programme through offering transdiagnostic tools and adaptable features; 
and providing appropriate b-CBT training and technical support.

BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is recognized as an independent risk factor 
for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), contributing to increased morbidity and 
mortality. While eHealth is increasingly used to deliver psychological 
interventions, their effectiveness for patients with CVDs remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of eHealth 
psychological interventions for patients with CVDs.
METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved from 5 databases (Embase, Medline, 
PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library), covering the period from database 
inception to December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating 
the effect of evidence-based psychological eHealth interventions to improve 
psychosocial well-being and cardiovascular outcomes for people with CVDs were 
included. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (version 2) was used to judge the 
methodological quality of reviewed studies. RevMan (version 5.3) was used for 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs, comprising 2319 participants from 10 countries, 
were included in the review. The results demonstrated significant alleviation of 
depressive symptoms for patients receiving psychological eHealth intervention 
compared to controls (number of paper included in that particular analysis, n=7; 
standardized mean difference=-0.30, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.14; I2=57%; P<.001). More 
specifically, in 6 trials where internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy was 
delivered, a significant alleviation of depressive symptoms was achieved 
(standardized mean difference=-0.39, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.21; I2=53%; P<.001). 
There was no significant change in anxiety or quality of life. Synthesis without 
meta-analysis regarding stress, adverse events, and cardiovascular events showed 
inconclusive findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological eHealth interventions, particularly internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy, can significantly reduce depressive symptoms among 
patients with CVDs. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for comprehensively 
improving psychological and cardiovascular outcomes. Future studies should 
explore integrating persuasive design features into eHealth and involving mental 
health professionals for intervention delivery.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common and co-morbid disorders that 
affect a significant proportion of students. Innovative prevention strategies 
targeting both conditions are needed to reduce their health burden and costs. 
ICare Prevent is such an innovative strategy and contains a transdiagnostic 
individually tailored Internet-based and mobile-supported intervention. It 
addresses common risk factors of depression and anxiety as part of a large 
EU-funded multi-country project* (ICare). Little is known about the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention compared to care as usual (CAU) 
for college students. We hypothesize that ICare Prevent will be more 
(cost-)effective than CAU in the reduction of symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.
METHODS: A three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled superiority trial will be 
conducted comparing a guided and an unguided version of ICare Prevent with a 
control group receiving CAU. The trial will be open-label but outcome assessors 
will be blinded. A total of 252 college students (age ≥ 16 years) with 
subclinical symptoms of depression defined as a score ≥ 16 on the Center for 
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and/or anxiety, defined as a 
score ≥ 5 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), will be included. 
Those meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder will be 
excluded. The primary outcome is change in disorder specific symptom severity 
from baseline to post-intervention. Secondary endpoints include self-reported 
depression and anxiety symptoms as well as time to onset of a mood or anxiety 
disorder until 12-month follow-up. Societal costs and quality of life will be 
assessed to estimate the intervention's cost-effectiveness compared to CAU.
DISCUSSION: Transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based prevention 
could be a (cost-)effective approach to tackle the disease burden of depression 
and anxiety among college students.

OBJECTIVES: Successful delivery of digital health interventions is affected by 
multiple real-world factors. These factors may be identified in routinely 
collected, ecologically valid data from these interventions. We propose ideas 
for exploring these data, focusing on interventions targeting complex, comorbid 
conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively explores pre-post data 
collected between 2016 and 2019 from users of digital cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT)-containing psychoeducation and practical exercises-for substance 
use disorder (SUD) at UK addiction services. To identify factors associated with 
heterogenous user responses to the technology, we employed multivariable and 
multivariate regressions and random forest models of user-reported questionnaire 
data.
RESULTS: The dataset contained information from 14 078 individuals of which 
12 529 reported complete data at baseline and 2925 did so again after engagement 
with the CBT. Ninety-three percent screened positive for dependence on 1 of 43 
substances at baseline, and 73% screened positive for anxiety or depression. 
Despite pre-post improvements independent of user sociodemographics, women 
reported more frequent and persistent symptoms of SUD, anxiety, and depression. 
Retention-minimum 2 use events recorded-was associated more with deployment 
environment than user characteristics. Prediction accuracy of post-engagement 
outcomes was acceptable (Area Under Curve [AUC]: 0.74-0.79), depending 
non-trivially on user characteristics.
DISCUSSION: Traditionally, performance of digital health interventions is 
determined in controlled trials. Our analysis showcases multivariate models with 
which real-world data from these interventions can be explored and sources of 
user heterogeneity in retention and symptom reduction uncovered.
CONCLUSION: Real-world data from digital health interventions contain 
information on natural user-technology interactions which could enrich results 
from controlled trials.

In an increasingly connected world and in the midst of a global pandemic, 
digital trials offer numerous advantages over traditional trials that rely on 
physical study sites. Digital trials have the potential to improve access to 
research and clinical treatments for the most vulnerable and minoritized, 
including pregnant and postpartum individuals. However, digital trials are 
underutilized in maternal and child health research, and there is limited 
evidence to inform the design and conduct of digital trials. Our research 
collaborative, consisting of 5 research teams in the U.S. and Australia, aimed 
to address this gap. We collaborated to share lessons learned from our 
experiences recruiting and retaining pregnant and postpartum individuals in 
digital trials of social and behavioral interventions. We first discuss the 
promise of digital trials in improving participation in research during the 
perinatal period, as well as the unique challenges they pose. Second, we present 
lessons learned from 12 completed and ongoing digital trials that have used 
platforms such as Ovia, Facebook, and Instagram for recruitment. Our trials 
evaluated interventions for breastfeeding, prenatal and postpartum depression, 
insomnia, decision making, and chronic pain. We focus on challenges and lessons 
learned in 3 key areas: (1) rapid recruitment of large samples with a diversity 
of minoritized identities, (2) retention of study participants in longitudinal 
studies, and (3) prevention of fraudulent enrollment. We offer concrete 
strategies that we pilot-tested to address these challenges. Strategies 
presented in this commentary can be incorporated, as well as formally evaluated, 
in future studies.

Efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Reducing Suicidal Ideation and 
Deliberate Self-Harm: Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in the 1980s, acceptance and commitment therapy 
(ACT) has become a reputable evidence-based psychological therapy for certain 
disorders. Trials examining the efficacy of ACT are spread across a broad 
spectrum of presentations, such as chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. 
Nevertheless, ACT has very rarely been trialed as an intervention for suicidal 
ideation (SI) or deliberate self-harm (DSH).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy of ACT in 
reducing SI and DSH and to examine the suitability of reported SI, DSH, and 
other measures in determining the efficacy of ACT.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed studies on ACT as intervention for SI and 
self-harm. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, 
SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane 
Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched. The reference lists of included 
studies and relevant systematic reviews were examined to identify additional 
publications. Search terms were identified with reference to the terminology 
used in previous review papers on ACT and suicide prevention. The study design 
was not restricted to randomized controlled trials. Screening was completed by 2 
reviewers, and all duplicates were removed. Publications were excluded if they 
were not published in English, were multicomponent therapy or were not based on 
ACT, or lacked a validated measure or structured reporting of SI/DSH outcomes.
RESULTS: After removing the duplicates, 554 articles were screened for 
relevance. Following the screening, 5 studies that used ACT as an intervention 
for suicidal or self-harming individuals were identified. The studies used 
diverse methodologies and included 2 case studies, 2 pre-post studies, and 1 
mHealth randomized controlled trial.
CONCLUSIONS: The review found that ACT is effective in reducing SI in the 2 
pre-post studies but not in other studies. However, given the small number and 
lack of methodological rigor of the studies included in this review, 
insufficient evidence exists for the recommendation of ACT as an intervention 
for SI or DSH.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and debilitating 
mental health disorder. Among different therapeutic approaches (eg, medication 
and psychotherapy), psychotherapy in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) is considered the gold standard treatment for MDD. However, although 
efficacious, CBT is not readily accessible to many patients in need because of 
hurdles such as stigma, long wait times, high cost, the large time commitment 
for health care providers, and cultural or geographic barriers. Electronically 
delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT) can effectively address many of 
these accessibility barriers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of 
implementing an e-CBT program compared with in-person treatment for MDD. It is 
hypothesized that the e-CBT program will offer results comparable with those of 
the in-person treatment program, regarding symptom reduction and quality of life 
improvement.
METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will provide e-CBT for 
MDD through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental 
health platform. Participants (aged 18-65 years) will be offered 12 weekly 
sessions of an e-CBT program tailored to MDD to address their depressive 
symptoms. Participants (n=55) will complete predesigned modules and homework 
assignments while receiving personalized feedback and interacting with a 
therapist through the platform. Using clinically validated symptomology 
questionnaires, the efficacy of the e-CBT program will be compared with that of 
a group (n=55) receiving in-person CBT. Questionnaires will be completed at 
baseline, at week 6 and week 12, and at a 6-month follow-up. Focus groups will 
be conducted to investigate personal, cultural, and social factors impacting the 
accessibility and feasibility of implementing a web-based psychotherapy tool 
from a patient and care provider perspective. Inclusion criteria include 
diagnosis of MDD, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak and 
read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion 
criteria include active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use 
disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation.
RESULTS: Ethics approval was obtained in January 2019, and recruitment of 
participants began in June 2019. Recruitment has been conducted via social 
media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 52 participants 
have been recruited to the e-CBT group, and 48 patients have been recruited to 
the in-person CBT group. Data collection is expected to be completed by March 
2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by June 2021, as linear 
regression (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for 
categorical outcomes) are still being conducted.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can provide valuable information for the 
development of more accessible and scalable mental health interventions with 
increased care capacity for MDD, without sacrificing the quality of care.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Stressful life events contribute to insomnia, psychosocial 
functioning, and illness. Though individuals with a history of insomnia may be 
especially vulnerable during stressful life events, risk may be mitigated by 
prior intervention. This study evaluated the effect of prior digital 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) versus sleep education on 
health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: COVID impact, insomnia, general- and COVID-related stress, depression, 
and global health were assessed in April 2020 in adults with a history of 
insomnia who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I (n = 102) versus 
sleep education control (n = 106) in 2016-2017. Regression analyses were used to 
evaluate the effect of intervention conditions on subsequent stress and health 
during the pandemic.
RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with COVID-19 related 
disruptions, and those who previously received dCBT-I reported less insomnia 
symptoms, less general stress and COVID-related cognitive intrusions, less 
depression, and better global health than those who received sleep education. 
Moreover, the odds for resurgent insomnia was 51% lower in the dCBT-I versus 
control condition. Similarly, odds of moderate to severe depression during 
COVID-19 was 57% lower in the dCBT-I condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Those who received dCBT-I had increased health resilience during 
the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with a history of insomnia and ongoing mild to 
moderate mental health symptoms. These data provide evidence that dCBT-I is a 
powerful tool to promote mental and physical health during stressors, including 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia has a bidirectional relationship with broader mental health 
functioning, including anxiety and depression. Yet, poor sleep has historically 
been neglected as a specific treatment target in mental health programmes 
(Freeman, Sheaves, Waite, Harvey, & Harrison, 2020).
METHOD: All patients over a 12-month period entering the Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service endorsing a 'poor sleep' questionnaire 
item at assessment, were offered a self-guided digital sleep intervention, 
Sleepio, in addition to routine care. Sleepio is based on the principles of 
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Propensity score matching 
established a non-Sleepio control group matched on demographic and baseline 
clinical measures.
RESULTS: Patients who signed up to Sleepio (n = 510) achieved significantly 
better outcomes on core clinical metrics (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WSAS) than controls. 
IAPT recovery rates1 (on PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were 64.7%, versus 58% in the control 
group. Duration of clinical contact time was marginally elevated overall in the 
Sleepio group but by less than 1 h CONCLUSIONS: Significant clinical benefit was 
associated with the introduction of an evidence-based digital sleep intervention 
alongside other mental health interventions for depression and anxiety. 
Widespread deployment was achieved with immediate availability, minimal 
additional clinical time or staff training. This approach provides a feasible 
and highly scalable model for improving mental health outcomes in clinical 
services.

BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of individuals with spinal cord injury 
(SCI) experience depression, which has been negatively associated with recovery 
and community participation after injury. Despite significant barriers to 
seeking and receiving in-person mental health care, little research has focused 
on the efficacy of telepsychology among individuals with SCI.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the design and implementation of an ongoing 
single-center, randomized controlled, video-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) intervention among individuals with SCI.
METHODS: Participants within 1 year of SCI will be randomized 1:1 to 
intervention or usual care in a 24-week study. Intervention participants will 
engage in 10 sessions of CBT over 12 weeks with a licensed clinical 
psychologist, using iPads via Apple FaceTime. Primary outcomes are depressive 
symptomatology, anxiety, and life satisfaction (as measured by the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Satisfaction with 
Life Scale, respectively) measured at three time points (baseline, 12 weeks, and 
24 weeks). These and other measures are also assessed during monthly telephone 
surveys conducted between primary timepoints.
RESULTS: Recruitment is ongoing. Forty-six participants have been enrolled thus 
far.
CONCLUSION: Telepsychology is a convenient, flexible, and effective alternative 
to traditional in-person services. We anticipate that intervention participants 
will experience improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms and will have 
greater life satisfaction. Telepsychology interventions among individuals with 
SCI are tasked to maintain participant privacy, provide assistive technology 
and/or engage caregivers to minimize mobility limitations, and manage risk 
remotely. Challenges encountered include recruitment during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Early intervention on symptoms of psychological morbidity using 
telepsychology may facilitate greater adaptation following SCI.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a digital intervention to support antidepressant 
discontinuation in UK primary care that is scalable, accessible, safe and 
feasible. In this paper, we describe the development using a theory, evidence 
and person-based approach.
DESIGN: Intervention development using a theory, evidence and person-based 
approach.
SETTING: Primary Care in the South of England.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen participants with a range of antidepressant experience 
took part in 'think aloud' interviews for intervention optimisation.
INTERVENTION: Our digital intervention prototype (called 'ADvisor') was 
developed on the basis of a planning phase consisting of qualitative and 
quantitative reviews, an in-depth qualitative study, the development of guiding 
principles and a theory-based behavioural analysis. Our optimisation phase 
consisted of 'think aloud' interviews where the intervention was iteratively 
refined.
RESULTS: The qualitative systematic review and in-depth qualitative study 
highlighted the centrality of fear of depression relapse as a key barrier to 
discontinuation. The quantitative systematic review showed that psychologically 
informed approaches such as cognitive-behavioural therapy were associated with 
greater rates of discontinuation than simple advice to reduce. Following a 
behavioural diagnosis based on the behaviour change wheel, social cognitive 
theory provided a theoretical basis for the intervention. The intervention was 
optimised on the basis of think aloud interviews, where participants suggested 
they like the flexibility of the system and found it reassuring. Changes were 
made to the tone of the material and the structure was adjusted based on this 
qualitative feedback.
CONCLUSIONS: 'ADvisor' is a theory, evidence and person-based digital 
intervention designed to support antidepressant discontinuation. The 
intervention was perceived as helpful and reassuring in optimisation interviews. 
Trials are now needed to determine the feasibility, clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of this approach.

BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders (DDs) are a public health problem. Face-to-face 
psychotherapeutic interventions are a first-line option for their treatment in 
adults. There is a growing interest in eHealth interventions to maximize 
accessibility for effective treatments. Thus, the number of randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) of eHealth psychotherapeutic interventions has 
increased, and these interventions are being offered to patients. However, it is 
unknown whether patients with DDs differ in internet-based and face-to-face 
intervention trials. This information is essential to gain knowledge about 
eHealth trials' external validity.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the baseline characteristics of patients with DDs 
included in the RCTs of eHealth and face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions 
with a cognitive component.
METHODS: In this meta-epidemiological study, we searched 5 databases between 
1990 and November 2017 (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and the 
database of Cuijpers et al). We included RCTs of psychotherapeutic interventions 
with a cognitive component (eg, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy 
[CBT], or interpersonal therapy) delivered face-to-face or via the internet to 
adults with DDs. Each included study had a matching study for predefined 
criteria to allow a valid comparison of characteristics and was classified as a 
face-to-face (CBT) or eHealth (internet CBT) intervention trial. Two authors 
selected the studies, extracted data, and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
We tested whether predefined baseline characteristics differed in face-to-face 
and internet-based trials using a mixed-effects model and testing for 
differences with z tests (statistical significance set at .05). For continuous 
outcomes, we also estimated the difference in means between subgroups with 95% 
CI.
RESULTS: We included 58 RCTs (29 matching pairs) with 3846 participants (female: 
n=2803, 72.9%) and mean ages ranging from 20-74 years. White participants were 
the most frequent (from 63.6% to 100%). Other socioeconomic characteristics were 
poorly described. The participants presented DDs of different severity measured 
with heterogeneous instruments. Internet CBT trials had a longer depression 
duration at baseline (7.19 years higher, CI 95% 2.53-11.84; 10.0 vs 2.8 years; 
P=.002), but the proportion of patients with previous depression treatment was 
lower (24.8% vs 42%; P=.04). Subgroup analyses found no evidence of differences 
for the remaining baseline characteristics: age, gender, education, living area, 
depression severity, history of depression, actual antidepressant medication, 
actual physical comorbidity, actual mental comorbidity, study dropout, quality 
of life, having children, family status, and employment. We could not compare 
proficiency with computers due to the insufficient number of studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The baseline characteristics of patients with DDs included in the 
RCTs of eHealth and face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions are generally 
similar. However, patients in eHealth trials had a longer duration of 
depression, and a lower proportion had received previous depression treatment, 
which might indicate that eHealth trials attract patients who postpone earlier 
treatment attempts.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mood disorder. Women face a heightened 
risk of depression during pregnancy and after childbirth, which can have 
negative consequences for both the mother and her family. It is essential to 
explore preventive strategies.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of education focused on health-promoting 
behaviors in preventing postpartum depression (PPD) through social messaging 
among pregnant women.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study involved 108 non-depressed 
eligible pregnant women with a gestational age of 28-30 weeks during 2022-2023. 
Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups using a 
block randomization method. The intervention group received virtual education 
based on health-promoting behaviors weekly over six sessions. The Edinburgh 
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and 
Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP II) questionnaires were utilized to 
evaluate outcomes. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 23, 
with a significance level set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: The mean differences between the scores of EPDS, PHQ-9 and HPLP II 
before and after the intervention in two groups were - 4.85 (CI95%= -3.22, 
-6.48), -6.22 (CI95%= -4.43, -8.00) and 28.22 (CI95%= 23.41, 33.03), 
respectively, which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The findings 
regarding the dimensions of health-promoting behaviors also indicated that all 
dimensions increased significantly in the intervention group. The greatest and 
least amount of change was observed in the physical activity dimension at 5.50 
(CI95%= 4.31, 6.68) and in interpersonal relations at 3.48 (CI95%= 2.24, 4.72), 
respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) for depression, based on the 
Edinburgh questionnaire six weeks postpartum was approximately 2.571, indicating 
that nearly one in two mothers who received education benefited.
CONCLUSION: The app-based health-promoting behaviors intervention-benefiting 
from not requiring in-person referrals and providing a common platform for 
communication-is effective in enhancing health-promoting behaviors, reducing 
depression scores and decreasing the frequency of PPD. In other words, this type 
of intervention led to the prevention of postpartum depression and the promotion 
of health-promoting behaviors among pregnant women.

Online psychological interventions have the potential to address many current 
issues facing service provision in child and adolescent mental health, not least 
improving access to evidence-based therapies and providing greater patient 
choice. Recognising this, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) now recommend digitally delivered therapy in the treatment of depression 
in children and young people (CYP). However, despite the virtual ubiquity of 
technology in young people's lives, and good evidence that online treatments can 
be effective, there remain barriers to real-world implementation. We argue that 
remote therapist support and blended approaches to therapy will be important 
models in harnessing the potential of digital technology in CYP mental health.

OBJECTIVES: Few digital health interventions for dementia caregivers, especially 
for racial and ethnic minorities, include long-term follow-ups. This study 
assessed the feasibility of two-year follow-up of the Wellness Enhancement for 
Caregivers (WECARE) intervention for Chinese American dementia caregivers, 
examined the changes in psychosocial health and explored future strategies.
METHOD: A mixed-method study was conducted two years after the initial WECARE 
intervention trial. Participants completed an online survey and phone 
interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed complementarily.
RESULTS: Eighteen of 24 participants completed the survey and 15 participated in 
interviews. Caregivers reported deteriorating conditions of care-recipients and 
increased caregiving burden, but their depressive symptoms and life satisfaction 
remained lower compared to baseline. Participants highlighted sustained benefits 
of WECARE, including stress management, improved communication, and a sense of 
community through group chats. They expressed a need for ongoing social and 
information support.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term evaluation for 
digital interventions like WECARE and emphasizes the need for continuous 
support. Sustained benefits underscore the potential of culturally tailored 
digital health interventions for underserved dementia caregivers. Future efforts 
should integrate ongoing resource access to enhance caregivers' long-term 
well-being.

BACKGROUND: Following the end of a child's treatment for cancer, parents may 
report psychological distress. However, there is a lack of evidence-based 
interventions that are tailored to the population, and psychological support 
needs are commonly unmet. An internet-administered low-intensity cognitive 
behavioral therapy (LICBT)-based intervention (EJDeR [internetbaserad självhjälp 
för föräldrar till barn som avslutat en behandling mot cancer]) may provide a 
solution.
OBJECTIVE: The first objective is to provide an overview of a multimethod 
approach that was used to inform the development of the EJDeR intervention. The 
second objective is to provide a detailed description of the EJDeR intervention 
in accordance with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication 
(TIDieR) checklist.
METHODS: EJDeR was developed through a multimethod approach, which included the 
use of existing evidence, the conceptualization of distress, participatory 
action research, a cross-sectional survey, and professional and public 
involvement. Depending on the main presenting difficulty identified during 
assessment, LICBT behavioral activation or worry management treatment protocols 
are adopted for the treatment of depression or generalized anxiety disorder when 
experienced individually or when comorbid. EJDeR is delivered via the Uppsala 
University Psychosocial Care Programme (U-CARE) portal, a web-based platform 
that is designed to deliver internet-administered LICBT interventions and 
includes secure videoconferencing. To guide parents in the use of EJDeR, weekly 
written messages via the portal are provided by e-therapists comprising final 
year psychology program students with training in cognitive behavioral therapy.
RESULTS: An overview of the development process and a description of EJDeR, 
which was informed by the TIDieR checklist, are presented. Adaptations that were 
made in response to public involvement are highlighted.
CONCLUSIONS: EJDeR represents a novel, guided, internet-administered LICBT 
intervention for supporting parents of children treated for cancer. Adopting the 
TIDieR checklist offers the potential to enhance fidelity to the intervention 
protocol and facilitate later implementation. The intervention is currently 
being tested in a feasibility study (the ENGAGE study).

BACKGROUND: Many cancer patients experience psychological distress and/or poor 
quality of life during or after their cancer treatment, yet they face multiple 
barriers to accessing psychological support. Digital psychological interventions 
represent a promising approach for addressing these barriers, however their 
comparative effectiveness remains uncertain.
METHODS: Nine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
from inception to July 2024. The primary outcomes were psychological distress 
and quality of life, and the secondary outcomes were measures of depression, 
anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, and fear of cancer recurrence in this study.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six RCTs with 23,154 participants were 
identified. Of these interventions, three types-digitally-delivered cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), health education, and virtual reality therapy 
(VRT)-demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared to 
non-active controls. Digital CBT, narrative interventions, and VRT significantly 
improved quality of life compared to non-active controls. For depression, both 
digital CBT and VRT were superior to the non-active control group. Regarding 
anxiety, CBT, psychoeducation, and VRT outperformed the non-active control 
group. In terms of fatigue, CBT, psychoeducation, VRT, and multi-component 
interventions all showed enhanced efficacy compared to the non-active control 
group. However, only CBT exhibited significantly superior effectiveness in 
alleviating insomnia compared to non-active controls. Similarly, only 
mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduced fear of cancer recurrence 
compared to the non-active control condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that digital CBT and VRT are highly promising 
options for reducing psychological distress and enhancing the quality of life 
among cancer patients; further high-quality randomized controlled trials 
involving diverse populations are essential to validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common mental health disorders worldwide. 
The UK's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme is part of 
the National Health Service (NHS) designed to provide a stepped care approach to 
treating people with anxiety and depressive disorders. Cognitive Behavioural 
Therapy (CBT) is widely used, with computerised and internet-delivered cognitive 
behavioural therapy (cCBT and iCBT, respectively) being a suitable IAPT approved 
treatment alternative for step 2, low- intensity treatment. iCBT has accumulated 
a large empirical base for treating depression and anxiety disorders. However, 
the cost-effectiveness and impact of these interventions in the longer-term is 
not routinely assessed by IAPT services. The current study aims to evaluate the 
clinical and cost-effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for symptoms 
of depression and anxiety disorders in IAPT.
METHODS: The study is a parallel-groups, randomised controlled trial examining 
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT interventions for depression 
and anxiety disorders, against a waitlist control group. The iCBT treatments are 
of 8 weeks duration and will be supported by regular post-session feedback by 
Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners. Assessments will be conducted at 
baseline, during, and at the end of the 8-week treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 
12-month follow-up. A diagnostic interview will be employed at baseline and 
3-month follow-up. Participants in the waitlist control group will complete 
measures at baseline and week 8, at which point they will receive access to the 
treatment. All adult users of the Berkshire NHS Trust IAPT Talking Therapies 
Step 2 services will be approached to participate and measured against set 
eligibility criteria. Primary outcome measures will assess anxiety and 
depressive symptoms using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Secondary outcome 
measures will allow for the evaluation of long-term outcomes, mediators and 
moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Analysis will be 
conducted on a per protocol and intention-to-treat basis.
DISCUSSION: This study seeks to evaluate the immediate and longer-term impact, 
as well as the cost effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for 
depression and anxiety. This study will contribute to the already established 
literature on internet-delivered interventions worldwide. The study has the 
potential to show how iCBT can enhance service provision, and the findings will 
likely be generalisable to other health services.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia and depression often co-occur. Cognitive behavioral therapy 
for insomnia (CBT-I) seems to be effective and safe for mitigating insomnia and 
depression. However, the efficacy of digitally-delivered CBT-I (dCBT-I) remains 
unclear. Therefore, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
was to systematically review and evaluate the efficacy of dCBT-I in adults with 
insomnia and depression.
METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science 
databases (as of June 5, 2022) was conducted for RCTs on dCBT-I. Statistical 
analyses were performed using Revan Manager. The effects of dCBT-I on insomnia 
and depression were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Seven studies involving 3,597 participants were included. This 
meta-analysis showed that dCBT-I reduced the severity of insomnia (SMD = -0.85, 
95% CI [-1.00 to -0.69], p < 0.001) and depression (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI [-0.55 
to -0.38], p < 0.001) in short terms, and also mitigated the severity of 
insomnia (SMD = -0.71, 95% CI [-1.00 to -0.44], p < 0.001) and depression (SMD = 
-0.42, 95% CI [-0.68 to -0.15], p = 0.002) in long terms. The effect of dCBT-I 
was comparable to that of traditional face-to-face CBT-I, and was generally 
maintained at follow-ups of 6 weeks to 6 months.
CONCLUSION: dCBT-I seems to be effective in alleviating insomnia and depression 
and might be considered as a viable treatment option for depression.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain conditions involve numerous physical and psychological 
challenges, and while psychosocial self-management interventions can be of 
benefit for people living with chronic pain, such in-person treatment is not 
always accessible. Digital self-management approaches could improve this 
disparity, potentially bolstering outreach and providing easy, relatively 
low-cost access to pain self-management interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the short-term 
efficacy of EPIO (ie, inspired by the Greek goddess for the soothing of pain, 
Epione), a digital self-management intervention, for people living with chronic 
pain.
METHODS: Patients (N=266) were randomly assigned to either the EPIO intervention 
(n=132) or a care-as-usual control group (n=134). Outcome measures included pain 
interference (Brief Pain Inventory; primary outcome measure), anxiety and 
depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-regulatory fatigue 
(Self-Regulatory Fatigue 18 scale), health-related quality of life (SF-36 Short 
Form Health Survey), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and pain 
acceptance (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire). Linear regression models 
used change scores as the dependent variables.
RESULTS: The participants were primarily female (210/259, 81.1%), with a median 
age of 49 (range 22-78) years and a variety of pain conditions. Analyses (n=229) 
after 3 months revealed no statistically significant changes for the primary 
outcome of pain interference (P=.84), but significant reductions in the 
secondary outcomes of depression (mean difference -0.90; P=.03) and 
self-regulatory fatigue (mean difference -2.76; P=.008) in favor of the 
intervention group. No other statistically significant changes were observed at 
3 months (all P>.05). Participants described EPIO as useful (ie, totally agree 
or agree; 95/109, 87.2%) and easy to use (101/109, 92.7%), with easily 
understandable exercises (106/109, 97.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-informed, user-centered digital pain self-management 
interventions such as EPIO may have the potential to effectively support 
self-management and improve psychological functioning in the form of reduced 
symptoms of depression and improved capacity to regulate thoughts, feelings, and 
behavior for people living with chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity is reduced during the post-partum period. Facebook 
is frequently used by Australian mothers, and offers flexibility, high levels of 
engagement and the ability to disseminate information and advice via social 
contacts. The Mums Step it Up Program is a newly developed 50 day team-based 
physical activity intervention delivered via a Facebook app. The program 
involves post-partum women working in teams of 4-8 friends aiming to achieve 
10,000 steps per day measured by a pedometer. Women are encouraged to use the 
app to log their daily steps and undertake social and supportive interactions 
with their friends and other participants. This study aims to determine the 
effectiveness of the Mums Step it Up Program.
METHOD/DESIGN: A sample of 126 women up to 12 months post-partum will be 
recruited through community-based health and family services. Participants will 
be randomly allocated into one of three groups: control, pedometer only and the 
Mums Step it Up Program. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 
6 months. The primary outcome (objective physical activity) and the secondary 
outcomes (sleep quality and quantity, depressive symptoms, weight and quality of 
life) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the Mums Step it Up Program 
compared with the control and pedometer only groups. Analyses will be undertaken 
on an intention-to-treat-basis using random effects mixed modeling. The effect 
of theorized mediators (physical activity attitudes, subjective norms and 
perceived behavioral control) will also be examined.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide information about the potential of a 
Facebook app for the delivery of health behavior interventions. If this 
intervention proves to be effective it will be released on a mass scale and 
promoted to the general public.

Insomnia poses a high risk for depression. Brain mechanisms of sleep and mood 
improvement following cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia remain elusive. 
This longitudinal study evaluated whether (i) individual differences in baseline 
brain white matter microstructure predict improvements and (ii) intervention 
affects brain white matter microstructure. People meeting the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder (n = 
117) participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing 6 weeks of no 
treatment with therapist-guided digital cognitive behavioural therapy for 
insomnia, circadian rhythm support or their combination (cognitive behavioural 
therapy for insomnia + circadian rhythm support). Insomnia Severity Index and 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report were assessed at baseline and 
followed up at Weeks 7, 26, 39 and 52. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance 
images were acquired at baseline and Week 7. Skeletonized white matter tracts, 
fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were quantified both tract-wise and 
voxel-wise using tract-based spatial statistics. Analyses used linear and mixed 
effect models while correcting for multiple testing using false discovery rate 
and Bonferroni for correlated endpoint measures. Our results show the following: 
(i) tract-wise lower fractional anisotropy in the left retrolenticular part of 
the internal capsule at baseline predicted both worse progression of depressive 
symptoms in untreated participants and more improvement in treated participants 
(fractional anisotropy × any intervention, PFDR = 0.053, Pcorr = 0.045). (ii) 
Only the cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia + circadian rhythm support 
intervention induced a trend-level mean diffusivity decrease in the right 
superior corona radiata (PFDR = 0.128, Pcorr = 0.108), and individuals with a 
stronger mean diffusivity decrease showed a stronger alleviation of insomnia (R 
= 0.20, P = 0.035). In summary, individual differences in risk and 
treatment-supported resilience of depression involve white matter 
microstructure. Future studies could target the role of the left retrolenticular 
part of the internal capsule and right superior corona radiata and the brain 
areas they connect.

Despite research into the development of digital cognitive behavioral therapy 
for insomnia (dCBT-I), research into the outcomes of dCBT-I on insomnia and the 
associated clinical conditions of depression and anxiety have been limited. The 
PubMed, PsycINFO (Ovid), Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on adult patients with insomnia also having 
reported measures of depressive or anxiety symptoms. In total, 2504 articles 
were identified after duplicate removal, and 22 RCTs were included in the final 
meta-analysis. At the post-treatment assessment, the dCBT-I group had a small to 
moderate effect in alleviating depressive (standardized mean difference 
(SMD) = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.28; p < 0.001; k = 21) and anxiety symptoms 
(SMD = -0.29; 95% CI: -0.40, -0.19; p < 0.001; k = 18), but had a large effect 
on sleep outcome measures (SMD = -0.76; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.57; p < 0.001; 
k = 22). When considering treatment adherence, the treatment effects of those in 
the high adherent groups identified a more robust outcome, showing greater 
effect sizes than those in the low adherent groups for depression, anxiety, and 
sleep outcomes. Furthermore, additional subgroup analysis on studies that have 
used the fully automated dCBT-I treatment without the support of human 
therapists reported significant treatment effects for depression, anxiety, and 
sleep outcomes. The results demonstrated that digital intervention for insomnia 
yielded significant effects on alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms as 
well as insomnia symptoms. Specifically, the study demonstrated significant 
effects on the above symptoms when considering treatment adherence and 
implementing fully automated dCBT-I.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are leading causes of disability worldwide, 
but access to quality mental health care is limited by myriad factors. 
Cognitive-behavioral coaching is rooted in evidence-based principles and has the 
potential to address some of these unmet care needs. Harnessing technology to 
facilitate broader dissemination within a blended care model shows additional 
promise for overcoming barriers to care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of a blended care 
coaching (BCC) program for clients presenting with moderate levels of anxiety 
and depression in real-world settings.
METHODS: This study examined retrospective data from US-based individuals 
(N=1496) who presented with moderate levels of depression and anxiety symptoms 
and who received blended care coaching services. Using a short-term framework, 
clients met with coaches via a secure video conference platform and also 
received digital video lessons and exercises. To evaluate the effectiveness of 
the BCC program, mixed effects modeling was used to examine growth trajectories 
of anxiety and depression scores over the course of care.
RESULTS: Out of the total sample of 1496 clients, 75.9% (n=1136) demonstrated 
reliable improvement, and 88.6% (n=1326) recovered based on either the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (anxiety) or Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(depression). On average, clients exhibited a significant decline in anxiety and 
depression symptoms during the initial weeks of coaching, with a continued 
decline over subsequent weeks at a lower rate. Engaging in a coaching session 
was associated with lower anxiety (b=-1.04) and depression (b=-0.79) symptoms in 
the same week, as well as lower anxiety (b=-0.74) and depression (b=-0.91) 
symptoms the following week (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The BCC program demonstrated strong outcomes in decreasing 
symptomology for clients presenting with moderate levels of anxiety and 
depression. When clients received coaching sessions, significant decreases in 
symptoms were observed, reflecting the importance of session attendance. 
Additionally, the steepest declines in symptoms tended to occur during the 
initial weeks of coaching, emphasizing the importance of client buy-in and early 
engagement. Collectively, these findings have implications for addressing unmet 
mental health care needs in a more accessible, cost-effective manner.

BACKGROUND: Aviophobia (the fear of flying) can greatly impact the daily life 
functioning of people with the condition. Traditional exposure-based treatment 
is hampered by the limited availability of airplane practice situations, which 
is a result of economical and practical concerns. Easily accessible and low-cost 
virtual reality exposure therapy may address these challenges.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of 
ZeroPhobia: Aviophobia (a self-help mobile app-based treatment) in reducing 
flight anxiety symptoms and depressive and anxiety symptoms. We will also 
investigate the effects of usage intensity, the sense of immersion, inherent 
absorption ability, and perceived user-friendliness on the treatment effect.
METHODS: Participants (N=114) who are aged 18-64 years and experience at least 
mild symptoms of aviophobia will be recruited from the general Dutch population 
and randomized into a treatment group or waitlist control group. By using their 
own phones and rudimentary mobile virtual reality headsets, participants will 
receive six modules of psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy, which 
will include six levels of virtual reality exposure therapy over a period of 6 
weeks. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, posttest (ie, after 6 weeks), 
and 3- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure of our study is the 
Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures include 
anxiety and depression measures and additional covariates (including usage 
intensity, the degree of immersion, etc). We will test treatment effectiveness 
by conducting an intention-to-treat analysis and estimating average treatment 
effects on the treated. The mechanisms of treatment effect will also be 
explored.
RESULTS: The study was funded on September 25, 2018. Ethical approval was 
received on October 11, 2019. Recruitment closed on May 7, 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study will further the scientific understanding and clinical 
implications of technology's current ability to aid in providing effective, 
accessible treatment for the fear of flying.

INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression is a significant global health challenge 
that affects mothers, infants, and families. Although various preventive 
strategies show promise, comprehensive reviews evaluating interventions among 
pregnant women without a clinical diagnosis of depression remain limited. This 
scoping review aims to identify and synthesize the existing evidence on 
proactive postpartum depression prevention programs initiated during pregnancy.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews, we systematically 
searched PubMed and Scopus, supplemented by manual reference reviews. Our search 
strategy combined terms related to postpartum depression, pregnancy, and 
preventive interventions. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions 
conducted during pregnancy, targeting women without a clinical diagnosis of 
depression, and assessed PPD outcomes using established diagnostic criteria or 
validated screening tools. Only English-language articles published between 2013 
and 2023 were considered.
RESULTS: A total of 49 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were 
categorized into nine themes: psychoeducation (n = 18), home visits (n = 6), 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (n = 6), mindfulness (n = 6), exercise 
(n = 4), dietary supplements (n = 3), interpersonal therapy (IPT) (n = 4), 
consultation (n = 1), and inhalation aromatherapy (n = 1). Psychoeducational and 
mindfulness-based interventions consistently reduce PPD risk, particularly when 
delivered in structured, theory-driven formats and incorporating family support. 
Digital CBT interventions demonstrated limited effectiveness due to lower 
engagement, while home-visit and consultation-based interventions were effective 
when integrated into existing maternal healthcare despite scalability 
challenges. Exercise and dietary supplement interventions yielded inconsistent 
outcomes, indicating that factors such as adherence, duration, and intensity are 
crucial determinants of effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: Various proactive interventions are available to prevent PPD, and 
this scoping review systematically maps the different strategies used and their 
outcomes. Proactive, theory-based, and multi-component interventions, 
particularly psychoeducational and mindfulness programs, demonstrate promising 
potential. Future research should emphasize evaluating long-term outcomes, 
optimizing digital engagement strategies, and developing culturally tailored 
models to enhance scalability and accessibility across diverse populations, 
including low-resource settings.

INTRODUCTION: Due to an increasing demand for healthcare in low-income and 
middle-income countries in Asia, it is important to develop a strategy to manage 
work-related stress in healthcare settings, particularly among nurses in these 
countries. The purpose of this three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to 
examine the effects of a newly developed smartphone-based multimodule stress 
management programme on reducing severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms as 
primary outcomes at 3-month and 7-month follow-ups among hospital nurses in 
Vietnam.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The target study population will be registered nurses 
working in a large general hospital (which employs approximately about 2000 
nurses) in Vietnam. They will be invited to participate in this study. 
Participants who fulfil the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to 
the free-choice, multimodule stress management (intervention group A, n=360), 
the internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT), that is, fixed-order stress 
management (intervention group B, n=360), or a treatment as usual control group 
(n=360). Two types (free-choice and fixed sequential order) of smartphone-based 
six-module stress management programmes will be developed. Participants in the 
intervention groups will be required to complete one of the programmes within 10 
weeks after the baseline survey. The primary outcomes are depressive and anxiety 
symptoms, measured by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) at 
3-month and 7 month follow-ups.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study procedures have been approved by the 
Research Ethics Review Board of Graduate School of Medicine/Faculty of Medicine, 
the University of Tokyo (no 11991) and the Ethical Review Board for Biomedical 
Research of Hanoi University of Public Health (no 346/2018/YTCC-HD3). If a 
significant effect of the intervention programmes will be found in the RCT, the 
programmes will be made available to all nurses in the hospital including the 
control group. If the positive effects are found in this RCT, the e-stress 
management programmes will be disseminated to all nurses in Vietnam.

BACKGROUND: Internet- and mobile-based interventions are most efficacious in the 
treatment of depression when they involve some form of guidance, but providing 
guidance requires resources such as trained personnel, who might not always be 
available (eg, during lockdowns to contain the COVID-19 pandemic).
OBJECTIVE: The current analysis focuses on changes in symptoms of depression in 
a guided sample of patients with depression who registered for an internet-based 
intervention, the iFightDepression tool, as well as the extent of intervention 
use, compared to an unguided sample. The objective is to further understand the 
effects of guidance and adherence on the intervention's potential to induce 
symptom change.
METHODS: Log data from two convenience samples in German routine care were used 
to assess symptom change after 6-9 weeks of intervention as well as minimal dose 
(finishing at least two workshops). A linear regression model with changes in 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score as a dependent variable and guidance 
and minimal dose as well as their interaction as independent variables was 
specified.
RESULTS: Data from 1423 people with symptoms of depression (n=940 unguided, 
66.1%) were included in the current analysis. In the linear regression model 
predicting symptom change, a significant interaction of guidance and minimal 
dose revealed a specifically greater improvement for patients who received 
guidance and also worked with the intervention content (β=-1.75, t=-2.37, 
P=.02), while there was little difference in symptom change due to guidance in 
the group that did not use the intervention. In this model, the main effect of 
guidance was only marginally significant (β=-.53, t=-1.78, P=.08).
CONCLUSIONS: Guidance in internet-based interventions for depression is not only 
an important factor to facilitate adherence, but also seems to further improve 
results for patients adhering to the intervention compared to those who do the 
same but without guidance.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults aged <25 years (youth) are at a higher 
risk of perinatal depression than older adults, and they experience elevated 
barriers to in-person care. Digital platforms such as social media offer an 
accessible avenue to deliver group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to 
perinatal youth.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop the Interactive Maternal Group for Information and 
Emotional Support (IMAGINE) intervention, a facilitated social media group CBT 
intervention to prevent perinatal depression in youth in the United States, by 
adapting the Mothers and Babies (MB) course, an evidence-based in-person group 
CBT intervention. In this study, we report perspectives of youth and health care 
providers on perinatal youths' mental health needs and document how they 
informed IMAGINE design.
METHODS: We conducted 21 semistructured in-depth individual interviews with 10 
pregnant or postpartum youths aged 14-24 years and 6 health care workers. All 
interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and 
inductive approaches to characterize perceptions of challenges and facilitators 
of youth perinatal mental health. Using a human-centered design approach, 
stakeholder perspectives were incorporated into the IMAGINE design. We 
classified MB adaptations to develop IMAGINE according to the Framework for 
Modification and Adaptation, reporting the nature, timing, reason, and goal of 
the adaptations.
RESULTS: Youth and health care workers described stigma associated with young 
pregnancy and parenting, social isolation, and lack of material resources as 
significant challenges to youth mental wellness. They identified nonjudgmental 
support, peer companionship, and access to step-by-step guidance as facilitators 
of youth mental wellness. They endorsed the use of a social media group to 
prevent perinatal depression and recommended that IMAGINE facilitate peer 
support, deliver content asynchronously to accommodate varied schedules, use a 
confidential platform, and facilitate the discussion of topics beyond the MB 
curriculum, such as navigating support resources or asking medical questions. 
IMAGINE was adapted from MB to accommodate stakeholder recommendations and 
facilitate the transition to web-based delivery. Content was tailored to be 
multimodal (text, images, and video), and the language was shortened and 
simplified. All content was designed for asynchronous engagement, and redundancy 
was added to accommodate intermittent access. The structure was loosened to 
allow the intervention facilitator to respond in real time to topics of interest 
for youth. A social media platform was selected that allows multiple 
conversation channels and conceals group member identity. All adaptations sought 
to preserve the fidelity of the MB core components.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the effect of stigmatization of young 
pregnancy and social determinants of health on youth perinatal mental health. 
Stakeholders supported the use of a social media group to create a supportive 
community and improve access to evidence-based depression prevention. This study 
demonstrates how a validated intervention can be tailored to this unique group.

Delivering Cognitive Behavior Therapy to Young Adults With Symptoms of 
Depression and Anxiety Using a Fully Automated Conversational Agent (Woebot): A 
Randomized Controlled Trial.

BACKGROUND: Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have 
demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by poor adherence. Conversational 
agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational 
agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as 
having symptoms of anxiety and depression.
METHODS: In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited 
online from a university community social media site and were randomized to 
receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT 
principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent 
(Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health 
ebook, "Depression in College Students," as an information-only control group 
(n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale 
(GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks 
later (T2).
RESULTS: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female 
(47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). 
Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an 
average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant 
differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of 
participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate 
analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression 
such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of 
depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while 
those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, 
participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the 
GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors 
were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors 
mirroring traditional therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and 
effective way to deliver CBT.

IMPORTANCE: Depression is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with 
persistent back pain and is associated with substantial adverse consequences, 
including the risk of developing opioid use disorders. Shifting the focus from 
depression treatment to preventing depression might be a viable way to reduce 
the disease burden.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention 
to reduce the incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) in patients with 
persistent back pain.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prevention of Depression in Back Pain 
Patients (PROD-BP) was a pragmatic, observer-blinded randomized clinical trial 
with a parallel design conducted in Germany. Eligible adults with a diagnosis of 
persistent back pain and subclinical depressive symptoms, but who were 
depression free, were recruited either on-site or after discharge from 82 
orthopedic clinics between October 1, 2015, and July 31, 2017. All analyses were 
conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle from October 31, 2018, 
to April 30, 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received an e-coach-guided, web-based 
self-help intervention that was based on cognitive behavioral therapy and 
tailored to the needs of patients with persistent back pain. The intervention 
included 6 obligatory modules and 3 optional modules to be completed by 
participants as well as feedback from e-coaches. Both the intervention and 
control groups had unrestricted access to treatment as usual.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was time to onset of an MDE over a 
12-month period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Secondary outcomes included depression severity, 
quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related disability, pain self-efficacy, 
work capacity, and user satisfaction assessed with a variety of instruments.
RESULTS: A total of 295 participants (mean [SD] age, 52.8 [7.7] years; 184 women 
[62.4%]) were recruited and randomized to either the intervention group 
(n = 149) or control group (n = 146). The intervention reduced the risk of MDE 
onset by 52% (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81; P < .001). Twenty-one 
participants (14.1%) in the intervention group and 41 participants (28.1%) in 
the control group experienced an MDE over the 12-month period. The number needed 
to treat to prevent 1 new case of MDE was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.79-9.44).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this trial showed that among patients with 
persistent back pain, depression can be prevented by a guided web-based 
self-help intervention in addition to treatment as usual. This finding suggests 
that using a scalable digital approach to integrate psychological treatment into 
routine pain management is feasible.

BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one 
of the most common mental disorders worldwide. In Hong Kong, the prevalence of 
SAD is high, but its treatment rate is low. SAD has immense impact on academic 
or work performance, social life, career development, and quality of life. One 
of the most effective treatments for SAD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 
with internet-based CBT (iCBT) and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) 
showing promise in treating SAD. However, internet interventions are 
underdeveloped in Chinese communities including Hong Kong.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an iCBT program that includes VRET, called 
"Ease Anxiety in Social Event Online" (Ease Online), for Hong Kong adults with 
SAD in a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: The 14-week Ease Online program is a guided self-help iCBT program with 
a blended mode of service delivery. The program comprises 9 web-based modules 
and 5 individual counseling sessions (including 2 VRET sessions) conducted 
remotely or face-to-face with a therapist to provide therapist support, as 
guided iCBT shows superior effects than unguided iCBT. Other program components 
include therapist feedback on assignments, internal messages, forums, client 
portfolios, web-based questionnaires, reminders, and web-based bookings. The 
program can be accessed either through a mobile app or program website through a 
PC with an internet connection. The participants are openly recruited and 
screened using a questionnaire and through an intake interview. Eligible 
participants are randomized by placing them into a web-based iCBT group, 
app-based iCBT group, or a waitlist control (WLC) group. Participants in the WLC 
group are assigned to the app-based program upon completion of the service of 
the 2 experimental groups. Measurements of social anxiety, depression and 
anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, automatic thoughts, and quality of 
life are administered at pretest, posttest, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. 
Multivariate ANOVA with repeated measures will be performed to determine the 
intervention effectiveness on the continuous variables over time.
RESULTS: Participant recruitment commenced in January 2021. As of February 2023, 
a total of 1811 individuals applied for the Ease Online program. In total, 401 
intake interviews have been completed, and 329 eligible participants have joined 
the program, among whom 166 have completed the service. Data collection is still 
ongoing, which is expected to be completed in March 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind in combining iCBT and VRET for 
the treatment of SAD in Hong Kong. At a theoretical level, this study 
contributes to the development and evaluation of internet-based psychological 
interventions in Hong Kong. At a practical level, the Ease Online program may 
serve as an alternative service option for SAD clients in Hong Kong if proven 
effective.

African Americans and Hispanics in the United States have much higher rates of 
HIV than non-minorities. There is now strong evidence that a range of behavioral 
interventions are efficacious in reducing sexual risk behavior in these 
populations. Although a handful of these programs are just beginning to be 
disseminated widely, we still have not implemented effective programs to a level 
that would reduce the population incidence of HIV for minorities. We proposed 
that innovative approaches involving computational technologies be explored for 
their use in both developing new interventions and in supporting wide-scale 
implementation of effective behavioral interventions. Mobile technologies have a 
place in both of these activities. First, mobile technologies can be used in 
sensing contexts and interacting to the unique preferences and needs of 
individuals at times where intervention to reduce risk would be most impactful. 
Second, mobile technologies can be used to improve the delivery of interventions 
by facilitators and their agencies. Systems science methods including social 
network analysis, agent-based models, computational linguistics, intelligent 
data analysis, and systems and software engineering all have strategic roles 
that can bring about advances in HIV prevention in minority communities. Using 
an existing mobile technology for depression and 3 effective HIV prevention 
programs, we illustrated how 8 areas in the intervention/implementation process 
can use innovative computational approaches to advance intervention adoption, 
fidelity, and sustainability.

BACKGROUND: GET.ON (HelloBetter) treatment interventions have been shown to be 
efficacious in multiple randomized controlled trials.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of 2 GET.ON interventions, 
GET.ON Mood Enhancer and GET.ON Stress, in a national digital mental health 
service implemented across Germany.
METHODS: Following an initial web-based questionnaire, participants were 
allocated to either intervention based on their baseline symptom severity and 
personal choice and received a semistandardized guided, feedback-on-demand 
guided, or self-guided version of the treatment. Uncontrolled routine care data 
from 851 participants were analyzed using a pretest-posttest design. Half of the 
participants (461/851, 54.2%) were allocated to the stress intervention 
(189/461, 41% semistandardized; 240/461, 52% feedback on demand; and 32/461, 
6.9% self-guided), and almost all participants in the mood intervention 
(349/352, 99.2%) received semistandardized guidance.
RESULTS: Results on depression-related symptom severity indicated a reduction in 
reported symptoms, with a large effect size of d=-0.92 (95% CI -1.21 to -0.63). 
Results on perceived stress and insomnia indicated a reduction in symptom 
severity, with large effect sizes of d=1.02 (95% CI -1.46 to -0.58) and d=-0.75 
(95% CI -1.10 to -0.40), respectively. A small percentage of participants 
experienced deterioration in depression-related symptoms (11/289, 3.8%), 
perceived stress (6/296, 2%), and insomnia (5/252, 2%). After completing 
treatment, 51.9% (150/289) of participants showed a clinically reliable change 
in depression-related symptoms, whereas 20.4% (59/289) achieved a close to 
symptom-free status. Similar improvements were observed in perceived stress and 
insomnia severity. Guidance moderated the effectiveness of and adherence to the 
interventions in reducing depressive symptom severity. Effect sizes on 
depression-related symptom severity were d=-1.20 (95% CI -1.45 to -0.93) for the 
semistandardized group, d=-0.36 (95% CI -0.68 to -0.04) for the 
feedback-on-demand group, and d=-0.83 (95% CI -1.03 to -0.63) for the 
self-guided group. Furthermore, 47.6% (405/851) of the participants completed 
all modules of the intervention. Participant satisfaction was high across all 
patient groups and both interventions; 89.3% (242/271) of participants would 
recommend it to a friend in need of similar help. Limitations include the 
assignment to treatments and guidance formats based on symptom severity. 
Furthermore, part of the differences in symptom change between groups must be 
assumed to be due to this baseline difference in the measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Future digital health implementation and routine care research 
should focus on monitoring symptom deterioration and other negative effects, as 
well as possible predictors of deterioration and the investigation of individual 
patient trajectories. In conclusion, this study supports the effectiveness of 
tailored digital mental health services in routine care for depression- and 
stress-related symptoms in Germany. The results highlight the importance of 
guidance in delivering internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions 
and provide further evidence for its potential delivered as web-only solutions 
for increasing access to and use of psychological treatments.

BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is one of the most common health problems among 
veterans and negatively impacts their health, function, and quality of life. 
Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line 
recommended treatment, sedative-hypnotic medications remain the most common. 
Sedative-hypnotics, however, have mixed effectiveness, are frequently prescribed 
longer than recommended, and are associated with numerous risks and adverse 
effects that negatively impact veteran function. Meeting the treatment needs of 
veterans impacted by insomnia requires delivering gold standard behavioral care, 
like CBT-I, and the reduction of sedative-hypnotics through innovative methods.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this feasibility clinical trial is to test a digital 
CBT-I approach combined with deprescribing to improve the success of 
sedative-hypnotic reduction among veterans. The intervention combines Noctem 
Health Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST), an effective and 
efficient, scalable, and adaptable digital platform to deliver CBT-I, with 
clinical pharmacy practitioner (CPP)-led deprescribing of sedative-hypnotic 
medications.
METHODS: In this nonrandomized single-group clinical trial, 50 veterans will be 
recruited and enrolled to receive CBT-I delivered via Noctem COAST and CPP-led 
deprescribing for up to 12 weeks. Assessments will occur at baseline, 
posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. The aims are to (1) assess the feasibility 
of recruiting veterans with chronic sedative-hypnotic use to participate in the 
combined intervention, (2) evaluate veterans' acceptability and usability of the 
COAST platform, and (3) measure changes in veterans' sleep, sedative-hypnotic 
use, and function at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up.
RESULTS: The institutional review board approved the study in October 2021 and 
the trial was initiated in May 2022. Recruitment and data collection began in 
September 2022 and is anticipated to be completed in April 2024. Aim 1 will be 
measured by tracking the response to a mail-centric recruitment approach using 
electronic medical records to identify potentially eligible veterans based on 
sedative-hypnotic use. Aim 2 will be measured using the Post-Study System 
Usability Questionnaire, assessing overall usability as well as system 
usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Aim 3 will use the 
Insomnia Severity Index and sleep diaries to measure change in insomnia 
outcomes, the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Profile to 
measure change in physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep 
disturbance, participation in social roles, pain, cognitive function, and 
self-reported sedative-hypnotic use to measure change in dose and frequency of 
use.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings will inform the utility of a combined digital CBT-I and 
CPP-led deprescribing intervention and the development of an adequately powered 
clinical trial to test the effectiveness in a diverse sample of veterans. 
Further, findings will help inform potential new approaches to deliver care and 
improve access to care for veterans with insomnia, many of whom use 
sedative-hypnotics that may be ineffective and increase the risk for negative 
outcomes.

This Review reports on a scoping review followed by a systematic review to 
consider interventions designed to address or manage depression or anxiety in 
children and young people up to the age of 25 years without the need to involve 
mental health professionals. The scoping review identified 132 approaches, 103 
of which referred to children or young people (younger than 25 years). These 
approaches included social interaction, engagement with nature, relaxation, 
distraction, sensory stimulation, physical activity, altering perceptions, 
engaging in hobbies, self-expression, and exploration. A systematic review of 
effectiveness studies from the literature identified in the scoping review found 
only 38 studies on seven types of intervention that met the inclusion criteria. 
16 studies were based on cognitive or behavioural principles (15 on digital 
interventions and one on bibliotherapy), ten focused on physical exercise, five 
on light therapy, three on dietary supplements, two on massage therapy, one on 
online peer support, and one on contact with a dog. Most studies focused on 
adolescents or young adults. Evidence suggested that light therapy could be 
effective for season depression and that digital interventions based on 
attention bias modification are ineffective for anxiety. Mixed evidence was 
available on the effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for 
depression and anxiety, and of physical exercise for depression. All other 
studies had insufficient certainty to obtain even tentative conclusions about 
effectiveness. These results highlight the disparity between the extensive range 
of approaches identified in the scoping review and the restricted number and 
focus found in the systematic review of effectiveness of these approaches. We 
call for an expanded research agenda that brings evaluation rigour to a wide 
range of self or community approaches.

Computerized Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Anxiety and Depression in Rural 
Areas: A Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND: People living in rural and remote communities have greater 
difficulty accessing mental health services and evidence-based therapies, such 
as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), than their urban counterparts. Computerized 
CBT (CCBT) can be used to effectively treat depression and anxiety and may be 
particularly useful in rural settings where there are a lack of suitably trained 
practitioners.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the global evidence regarding the clinical 
effectiveness and acceptability of CCBT interventions for anxiety and/or 
depression for people living in rural and remote locations.
METHODS: We searched seven online databases: Medline, Embase Classic and Embase, 
PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. We also hand 
searched reference lists, Internet search engines, and trial protocols. Two 
stages of selection were undertaken. In the first, the three authors screened 
citations. Studies were retained if they reported the efficacy, effectiveness or 
acceptability of CCBT for depression and/or anxiety disorders, were peer 
reviewed, and written in English. The qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 
10, was then used to run automated text searches for the word "rural," its 
synonyms, and stemmed words. All studies identified were read in full and were 
included in the study if they measured or meaningfully discussed the efficacy or 
acceptability of CCBT among rural participants.
RESULTS: A total of 2594 studies were identified, of which 11 met the selection 
criteria and were included in the review. The studies that disaggregated 
efficacy data by location of participant reported that CCBT was equally 
effective for rural and urban participants. Rural location was found to both 
positively and negatively predict adherence across studies. CCBT may be more 
acceptable among rural than urban participants—studies to date showed that rural 
participants were less likely to want more face-to-face contact with a 
practitioner and found that computerized delivery addressed confidentiality 
concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: CCBT can be effective for addressing depression and anxiety and is 
acceptable among rural participants. Further work is required to confirm these 
results across a wider range of countries, and to determine the most feasible 
model of CCBT delivery, in partnership with people who live and work in rural 
and remote communities.

BACKGROUND: Mental health problems in university students are associated with 
many negative outcomes, yet there is a gap between need and timely access to 
help. Single-session interventions (SSIs) are designed to be scalable and 
accessible, delivering core evidence-based intervention components within a 
one-off encounter.
OBJECTIVE: COMET (Common Elements Toolbox) is an online self-help SSI that 
includes behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, gratitude, and 
self-compassion. COMET has previously been evaluated in India, Kenya, and the 
United States with promising results. This study tests the acceptability, 
appropriateness, perceived utility, and efficacy of COMET among UK university 
students during the peripandemic period.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of 
COMET compared with a control group, with 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Outcome 
variables were subjective well-being, depression severity, anxiety severity, 
positive affect, negative affect, and perceived stress. We also measured 
intervention satisfaction immediately after completion of COMET. All UK 
university students with access to the internet were eligible to participate and 
were informed of the study online. The data were analyzed using linear mixed 
models and reported in accordance with the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and 
Online Telehealth) checklist.
RESULTS: Of the 831 people screened, 468 participants were randomized to a 
condition, 407 completed the postintervention survey, 147 returned the 2-week 
follow-up survey, 118 returned the 4-week follow-up survey, and 89 returned 
both. Of the 239 randomized, 212 completed COMET. Significant between-group 
differences in favor of the COMET intervention were observed at 2-week 
follow-ups for subjective well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale; 
mean difference [MD] 1.39, 95% CI 0.19-2.61; P=.03), depression severity (9-item 
Patient Health Questionnaire; MD -1.31, 95% CI -2.51 to -0.12; P=.03), and 
perceived stress (4-item Perceived Stress Scale; MD -1.33, 95% CI -2.10 to 
-0.57; P<.001). Overall, participants were satisfied with COMET, with the 
majority endorsing the intervention and its modules as acceptable, appropriate, 
and exhibiting high utility. The self-compassion module was most often reported 
as the participants' favorite module and the behavioral activation module was 
their least favorite. Qualitative analysis revealed that participants found 
COMET generally accessible, but too long, and experienced immediate and 
long-term beneficial effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high engagement with the COMET 
intervention, along with preliminary short-term efficacy. Almost all 
participants completed the intervention, but study attrition was high. 
Participant feedback indicated a high level of overall satisfaction with the 
intervention, with perceived accessibility, immediate benefits, and potential 
long-term impact being notable findings. These findings support the potential 
value of COMET as a mental health intervention and highlight important areas for 
further improvement.

BACKGROUND: Depression is prevalent among older adults, and internet-delivered 
psychological interventions (IDPIs) have emerged as a promising solution.
AIM: To explore the landscape of IDPIs for late-life depression, examining 
current characteristics, psychotherapies, intervention strategies, facilitators, 
and barriers.
METHOD: Guided by a PRISMA-guided scoping review, we systematically searched 
five electronic databases.
RESULTS: 25 relevant studies were identified. IDPIs were used for treatment, 
prevention, and assessment. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy was the 
most common psychotherapy. Seven strategies to provide tailored services include 
psychotherapy courses, professional involvement, mood and progress tracking, 
virtual community, timed reminders, additional learning resources, and 
gamification elements. Barriers contained cognitive impairment, low digital 
literacy, device inaccessibility, limited depression awareness, adherence 
issues, and acclimation time, while facilitators included prior treatment 
experience, real-life character stories, strong client-worker bonds, and 
integration into daily care routines.
CONCLUSION: IDPIs present an accessible and convenient avenue for older adults. 
Future directions suggest exploring minimalist interventions, diverse 
strategies, and optimized implementation to amplify IDPIs impact among this 
vulnerable group.

OBJECTIVE: E-mental health technologies are increasing rapidly, both in number 
and in utilisation by consumers, health systems and researchers. This review 
aimed to: (i) examine the features and scientific evidence for e-mental health 
programs; (ii) describe the growth in these programs in the past decade, and 
track the extent and quality of scientific research over time; and (iii) examine 
Australian and international contribution to the field.
METHOD: Two types of e-mental health programs; 'web interventions' and mobile 
applications'; targeting depression, bipolar disorder, generalised anxiety 
disorder, social anxiety, panic disorder and general stress were included. Data 
were collected from the Beacon website (www.beacon.anu.edu.au; last updated July 
2011). Features of each program and their supporting scientific evidence were 
coded.
RESULTS: In total, 62 web interventions and 11 mobile applications were 
identified. Half of these were developed in Australia. The majority of programs 
were aimed towards adults and were based upon cognitive behavioural therapy. 
Approximately equal numbers of programs were developed for all targeted 
disorders except bipolar disorder, which was underrepresented. Only 35.5% of 
programs, all of which were web-based, had been evaluated by at least one RCT. 
The number of publications over the last decade is increasing. The majority were 
from Australian sources. Non-Australian research was lower in diversity and 
quantity.
CONCLUSIONS: E-mental health research is increasing globally. Australia 
continues to be an international leader in this field. Depression, anxiety and 
panic disorder remain the disorders most targeted. Whilst the scientific 
evidence supporting e-mental health programs is growing, a substantial lack of 
high-quality empirical support was evident across the field, particularly for 
mobile applications and bipolar and social anxiety.

The Cross-Cultural Validation of Neuropsychological Assessments and Their 
Clinical Applications in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: A Scoping Analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The present study explores the cross-cultural validation of 
neuropsychological assessments and their clinical applications in cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT) across 
diverse populations and settings.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted 
in multiple academic databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of 
Science. Keywords related to cognitive behavioral therapy, cultural adaptation, 
and specific populations were used. The inclusion criteria encompassed 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pilot studies that assessed CA-CBT for 
various mental health conditions.
RESULTS: The review included studies involving Chinese Americans, Latino 
caregivers, Syrian refugees, Jordanian children, Malaysian Muslims, Afghan 
refugees, Iraqi women, Japanese children and adolescents, and Tanzanian and 
Kenyan children. CA-CBT demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and psychosis. For instance, research has 
shown that CA-CBT is more effective than standard CBT in reducing depressive 
symptoms among Chinese Americans and in significantly lowering PTSD symptoms in 
Syrian refugee women. This method has been well-received and is feasible for use 
in diverse populations, such as Jordanian children and Afghan refugees. The 
long-term benefits are promising, with sustained improvements being reported in 
various studies. Additionally, digital and remote delivery methods have 
demonstrated potential for expanding the accessibility of CA-CBT.
CONCLUSIONS: CA-CBT is a valuable and effective intervention for diverse 
cultural populations, significantly improving mental health outcomes. However, 
future research must address limitations such as small sample sizes, short 
follow-up periods, and variability in assessment tools. Future studies should 
include larger and more diverse sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, rigorous 
control groups, and comprehensive outcome measures to further validate and 
enhance the application of CA-CBT across different cultural contexts.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based programs can help provide accessible and inexpensive 
behavioral health care to those in need; however, the evaluation of these 
interventions has been mostly limited to controlled trials. Data regarding 
patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online 
interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to 
address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, 
in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users' levels of stress and 
depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and 
usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be 
useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is 
understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs 
by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed 
session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to 
complete more sessions.
METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress 
triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using 
qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability 
questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. 
Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and 
depression over time.
RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most 
of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 
individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The 
most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with 
family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in 
the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating 
or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the 
conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% 
(16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and 
acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better 
than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress 
showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant 
decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression 
severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and 
two.
CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were 
some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. 
Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported 
stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and 
rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the 
attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available 
online-based interventions.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are characterized by a high likelihood of 
recurrence. Thus, aftercare and follow-up interventions aim to maintain 
treatment gains and to prevent relapse. Internet- and mobile-based interventions 
(IMIs) may represent promising instruments in tertiary prevention. This 
systematic review summarizes and evaluates the research on the efficacy of IMIs 
as aftercare or follow-up interventions for adults with mental health issues.
METHODS: A systematic database search (PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CENTRAL) was conducted 
and studies selected according to predefined eligibility criteria (RCTs, adult 
population, clinical symptoms/disorder, assessed with validated instruments, 
clinical-psychological intervention rationale, aftercare/follow-up intervention, 
web-/mobile-based, minimum follow-up measurement of three months, inclusion of a 
control group). Inspected outcomes were symptom severity, recurrence- and 
rehospitalization rates, functioning, quality of life and adherence to primary 
treatment.Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42017055289.
RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria, covering trials on depression 
(n = 5), eating disorders (n = 4) and transdiagnostic interventions (n = 7). The 
majority of the interventions were based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) 
principles and were web-based (n = 11). Methodological quality of included 
studies was suboptimal. Limitations included attrition bias and 
non-specification of routine care co-interventions. IMIs yielded small to medium 
post-treatment effects for symptom severity (d = -0.08 - d = -0.45) in 
comparison to control groups. Best evidence base was found for symptom severity 
of depression and anxiety. Study results regarding recurrence and 
rehospitalization were inconsistent.
DISCUSSION: There is some evidence, that IMIs are feasible instruments for 
maintaining treatment gains for some mental disorders. However, further high 
quality, large-scale trials are needed to expand research fields, improve 
adherence to and uptake of IMIs and facilitate implementation of effective 
interventions into routine care.

OBJECTIVE: A user-centered approach is critical for increasing the adherence to 
and effectiveness of an internet- and mobile-based intervention program. 
Therefore, potential future intervention users were involved in the development 
of an internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (iCBT) for 
adolescents and young adults (AYA) with chronic medical conditions and comorbid 
symptoms of anxiety or depression. We aimed to identify challenges and coping 
strategies of the intended target group, as well as their needs and preferred 
intervention characteristics for an iCBT program.
METHODS: Twenty AYA (aged 14-20, 60% females) with either type 1 diabetes (55%), 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (25%) or cystic fibrosis (20%) were interviewed in 
condition-specific focus groups (4-11 participants per group) either via 
videoconferencing or face-to-face. Transcript verbatim data was analyzed using 
content analysis.
RESULTS: Frequently reported disease-specific burdens were among others fear of 
disease progression, non-acceptance of disease and stressful incidents related 
to and aversions against medical therapy. Most frequently reported coping 
strategies included, seeking social support and accepting the disease. 
Recommendations for the content of an iCBT for comorbid symptoms of anxiety and 
depression comprised: dealing with disease-related fears and getting advice on 
health-promoting lifestyles. iCBT characteristics considered preferable by 
participants were: providing individual feedback by a real-person; 
implementation of a feature to monitor treatment progress; youthful and varied 
content presentation; time per session not exceeding 1 h; non-involvement of 
parents. A mobile-based reminder feature was considered useful, and individual 
tailoring and self-determination of iCBT content was considered desirable.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight important patient perspectives and 
age-specific recommendations which can help design more optimal iCBT 
interventions for AYA with chronic medical conditions.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification (diet, exercise, and behavioral 
interventions) is the first-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 
The benefits of face-to-face lifestyle modification intervention in a short time 
have been demonstrated. However, few studies have investigated the mobile 
technology effects on lifestyle modification in PCOS. Therefore, we examined the 
effect of transtheoretical model-based mobile health application intervention 
program for PCOS.
METHODS: A randomised controlled, single-blind trial, was carried out from 
October 2018 to March 2019, which included 122 participants recruited from 
gynecology outpatient clinics of affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University 
in Guizhou. The study participants were randomised into intervention (n = 61) 
and control groups (n = 61). Participants in the intervention group undertook a 
TTM-based mobile health application program in addition to routine care, and 
participants in the control group received only routine care.
RESULTS: Fifty-one participants in the intervention group and 49 in the control 
group completed the study. Compared to the control group, participants in the 
intervention group showed statistically significant decrease for BMI (P < 0.05), 
WC (P < 0.05), SAS (P < 0.05), and SDS (P < 0.05) scores at 6-month and 
12-month, respectively. Behavior stage change of exercise and diet among 
paticipants with PCOS was significant at 6 months (c2 = 43.032, P < 0.05) and 
12th months (c2 = 49.574, P < 0.05) between the intervention and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the TTM-based mobile health application 
program can decrease BMI, WC, anxiety, and depression, and improve exercise and 
diet adherence in patients with PCOS in the long term. The TTM-based mobile 
health application program can be applied for lifestyle modification in women 
with PCOS. Trial registration This study was approved by the ethics committee 
NO.[2019]1-028 in March 2018 and was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial 
Registry (website: www.chictr.org.cn , registry number: ChiCTR2000034572).

Plain Language Summary: Poor adherence of life management in patients with PCOS 
and many then go on to adherence poor health outcomes as a result. There is an 
urgent need for new approach to enhance to life management compliance for 
patients with PCOS. TTM is a common behavior change model, which can effectively 
promote the behavior change of patients, but it has not been used in the life 
management of PCOS patients. Meanwhile, the traditional life management of PCOS 
is mainly face-to-face intervention, few studies have investigated the mobile 
technology effects on lifestyle modification in PCOS. This study aimed to 
evaluate the long-term effects of TTM-based mobile technology (for lifestyle 
modification) on the maintenance of health-related behavior changes among women 
with PCOS. This study confirmed that the TTM-based mobile health application 
program can decrease BMI, WC, anxiety, and depression, and improve exercise and 
diet adherence in patients with PCOS in the long term. Our study conducted 
TTM-based mobile health application program can provide a reference for other 
researchers or research organizations.

BACKGROUND: As a substitute for traditional drug therapy, digital 
cognitive-behavioral therapy positively impacts the regulation of brain 
function, which can improve insomnia. However, there is currently a paucity of 
studies on digital cognitive behavioral therapy as a treatment for insomnia.
AIM: To assess digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia regarding its 
positive impact on brain function.
METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a go/no-go group or a 
dot-probe group. The primary outcome was quality of sleep as assessed by the 
actigraphy sleep monitoring bracelet, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), 
insomnia severity index (ISI), and depression anxiety and stress scale 
(DASS-21).
RESULTS: Eighty patients were included in the analysis (go/no-go group: n = 40; 
dot-probe group: n = 40). We combined the total scale scores of the two groups 
before and after the intervention in the analysis of covariance. Our study 
explored whether insomnia symptoms in both groups can be improved by using 
digital cognitive behavioral therapy instead of trying to compare the two 
trials; therefore, only one P value is listed. In both groups, we found a 
short-term time effect on insomnia symptom severity (PSQI: P < 0.001, η 2 = 
0.336; ISI: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.667; DASS-depression: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.582; 
DASS-anxiety: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.337; DASS-stress: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.443) and 
some effect on sleep efficiency (but it was not significant, P = 0.585, η 2 = 
0.004).
CONCLUSION: Go/no-go task training of inhibitory function had a short-term 
positive effect on sleep efficiency, whereas dot-probe task training had a 
positive short-term effect on emotion regulation.

BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a serious mental health disorder 
that when left untreated can lead to significant social, occupational, 
educational, and functional impairment. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the 
recommended first-line psychological treatment for SAD and has been shown to be 
efficacious in face-to-face and online formats. However, treatment is lengthy, 
and many people drop out prematurely. Pilot research suggests that brief 
intensive internet CBT (iCBT) for SAD is feasible and acceptable, but further 
evaluation using randomised controlled trials (RCT) is needed.
METHODS: A RCT to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an 
intensive 7-day iCBT program for adults diagnosed with SAD (with or without 
comorbid major depressive disorder) in comparison to a waitlist control (WLC) is 
currently in progress. Eligible participants will be randomised to an 
intervention or WLC group. Participants allocated to the intervention will 
complete 6 iCBT modules over 7 days, with CBT skills practice each day, and 
clinician guidance provided remotely by telephone and email. Participants 
allocated to the WLC will be given access to the program after a 6-week waiting 
period. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, 2 weeks and 
6 weeks post-baseline. Outcome measures will assess for social anxiety (SIAS, 
SPS), depression (PHQ-9), personality (LPFS, PID-5-BF), and functioning (WSAS). 
Intention-to-treat linear mixed model analyses will be used to evaluate primary 
and secondary outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Previous findings from a pilot trial showed that 7-day iCBT is 
feasible and acceptable to clients with SAD. Based on these findings, we expect 
the treatment group will improve significantly on measures of symptoms of social 
anxiety, depression, and functional impairment compared to the WLC, and these 
improvements will be sustained at 1-month follow-up. If demonstrated to be 
effective in this RCT, intensive 7-day iCBT for SAD is a novel way to deliver 
CBT more quickly, with potential to reach more clients and reduce drop-out 
rates. It has great potential to provide rapid symptom improvement to 
individuals with SAD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian 
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on March 1, 2022 (ACTRN12622000361707).

INTRODUCTION: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) receiving hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT) are at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. Heart 
rate variability (HRV), a surrogate for autonomic nervous system activity, is a 
promising digital biomarker that has been linked to important outcomes. The 
objectives of this study were to prospectively describe the trajectory of HRV 
among AYAs receiving HCT and explore the association between HRV and 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
METHODS: This was a multi-site study embedded in a randomized trial among AYAs 
receiving HCT (NCT03640325). We collected sequential 24-h HRV metrics, including 
the standard deviation of normal-to-normal beats (SDNN), root-mean-square of 
successive differences (RMSSD), as well as frequency domain measures. PRO 
surveys queried anxiety, depression, quality of life, hope, and resilience at 
baseline and 3 months. We summarized outcomes using descriptive statistics, and 
Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between 
HRV and PROs.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine HRV recordings were collected from n = 16 participants aged 
12-21 years. There was a moderately strong correlation between inferior baseline 
HRV and higher anxiety and depression (anxiety: r = -0.35 (p = 0.18) for SDNN, 
r = -0.47 (p = 0.07) for RMSSD; depression: r = -0.26 (p = 0.34) for SDNN, 
r = -0.39 (p = 0.14) for RMSSD). Among participants with elevated baseline 
anxiety, higher HRV suggested greater improvement in anxiety over time 
(r = -0.66 (p = 0.08) for SDNN, r = -0.31 (p = 0.45) for RMSSD).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a correlation between HRV and PROs in this study, and 
among those with elevated anxiety, HRV predicted improvement over time. Digital 
biomarkers may augment behavioral intervention design and implementation.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has a high worldwide prevalence and 
there are few effective treatment options. Patient education can influence 
patient behavior that subsequently may lead to changes in attitudes and skills 
necessary for maintenance or improvement in management of symptom severity and 
quality of life. However, as postdiagnostic patient education can be resource 
demanding, assessment of digital approaches and verification of their 
effectiveness is warranted.
OBJECTIVE: This cohort study aimed to investigate the effects of a digital 
web-based multidisciplinary eHealth program on the domains of symptom severity 
(Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS]), quality of life 
(irritable bowel syndrome quality of life [IBS-QOL]), anxiety and depression 
(Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and a measure of general client 
satisfaction (client satisfaction questionnaire), compared with an onsite 
multidisciplinary 2-day group-based education program ("IBS-school"), in 2 
cohorts of 255 patients with IBS.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with IBS, aged 15-70 years, were enrolled after 
referral to the Section of Gastroenterology at Haukeland University Hospital, 
Norway. In total, 132 patients were recruited to the eHealth program and 123 to 
the IBS-school group for comparison. Data were self-reported and collected 
digitally at enrollment and after 3 months, between 2017 and 2019. Furthermore, 
71 attending the eHealth program and 49 attending the IBS-school completed the 
questionnaires at 3 months. Intervention response was defined as a reduction of 
≥50 points on the IBS-SSS.
RESULTS: Patients attending the eHealth program reported a significant reduction 
in IBS symptom severity 3 months after treatment (n=71), compared with patients 
attending the IBS-school (n=50). Overall, patients categorized as intervention 
responders in both programs showed a significant reduction in symptom severity 
at 3 months. Here, 41% (29/71) of patients attending the eHealth program 
reported a mean IBS-SSS reduction of 103 (SD 72.0) points (P<.001). In addition, 
these patients reported reduced anxiety (P>.001) and depression (P=.002) and 
enhanced quality of life (P=.03), especially the degrees of dysphoria, body 
image, food avoidance, health worry, interference with activity, relations, and 
social relations. Patients responding to the IBS-school intervention (18/50, 
36%) reported a mean IBS-SSS reduction of 119 (SD 86.2) points (P<.001), and 
reduced depression scores (P=.046), but no difference in overall quality of 
life. Both groups reported the respective interventions as "good" quality health 
care programs, scoring them 23.5 (SD 4)-the eHealth program 23.5 (SD 4), and the 
IBS-school 24.2 (SD 4)-on the client satisfaction questionnaire.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the digital multidisciplinary eHealth program has 
a significant effect on IBS symptom severity in a portion of patients; it is 
useful as a tool in disease self-management and does not result in worse symptom 
scores than an onsite multidisciplinary 2-day group-based education program 
after 3 months. We believe these results indicate that a digital eHealth 
approach is preferable to an onsite multidisciplinary 2-day group-based 
education program covering the same topics.

Human evolution has regularly intersected with technology. Digitalization of 
various services has brought a paradigm shift in consumerism. Treading 
this path, mental health practice has gradually moved to Digital Mental Health 
Interventions (DMHI), to improve service access and delivery. Applied games are 
one such innovation that has gained recent popularity in psychiatry. Based on 
the principles of gamification, they target psychosocial and cognitive domains, 
according to the deficits in various psychiatric disorders. They have been used 
to deliver cognitive behaviour therapy, cognitive training and rehabilitation, 
behavioural modification, social motivation, attention enhancement, and 
biofeedback. Research shows their utility in ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders, 
eating disorders, post-traumatic stress, impulse control disorders, depression, 
schizophrenia, dementia, and even healthy aging. Virtual reality and artificial 
intelligence have been used in conjunction with gaming interventions to 
improvise their scope. Even though these interventions hold promise in 
engagement, ease of use, reduction of stigma, and bridging the mental-health 
gap, there are pragmatic challenges, especially in developing countries. These 
include network quality, infrastructure, feasibility, socio-cultural 
adaptability, and potential for abuse. Keeping this in the background, this 
review summarizes the scope, promise, and evidence of digital gaming in 
psychiatric practice, and highlights the potential caveats in their 
implementation.

Insomnia is associated with fatigue, but it is unclear whether response to 
cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia is altered in individuals with 
co-occurring symptoms of insomnia and chronic fatigue. This is a secondary 
analysis using data from 1717 participants with self-reported insomnia in a 
community-based randomized controlled trial of digital cognitive behaviour 
therapy for insomnia compared with patient education. We employed baseline 
ratings of the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire to identify participants with more 
or fewer symptoms of self-reported chronic fatigue (chronic fatigue, n = 592; no 
chronic fatigue, n = 1125). We used linear mixed models with Insomnia Severity 
Index, Short Form-12 mental health, Short Form-12 physical health, and the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale separately as outcome variables. The main 
covariates were main effects and interactions for time (baseline versus 9-week 
follow-up), intervention, and chronic fatigue. Participants with chronic fatigue 
reported significantly greater improvements following digital cognitive 
behaviour therapy for insomnia compared with patient education on the Insomnia 
Severity Index (Cohen's d = 1.36, p < 0.001), Short Form-12 mental health 
(Cohen's d = 0.19, p = 0.029), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(Cohen's d = 0.18, p = 0.010). There were no significant differences in the 
effectiveness of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia between 
chronic fatigue and no chronic fatigue participants on any outcome. We conclude 
that in a large community-based sample of adults with insomnia, co-occurring 
chronic fatigue did not moderate the effectiveness of digital cognitive 
behaviour therapy for insomnia on any of the tested outcomes. This may further 
establish digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia as an adjunctive 
intervention in individuals with physical and mental disorders.

Efficacy of an Unguided, Digital Single-Session Intervention for Internalizing 
Symptoms in Web-Based Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial.

BACKGROUND: The Common Elements Toolbox (COMET) is an unguided digital 
single-session intervention (SSI) based on principles of cognitive behavioral 
therapy and positive psychology. Although unguided digital SSIs have shown 
promise in the treatment of youth psychopathology, the data are more mixed 
regarding their efficacy in adults.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of COMET-SSI versus a 
waiting list control in depression and other transdiagnostic mental health 
outcomes for Prolific participants with a history of psychopathology.
METHODS: We conducted an investigator-blinded, preregistered randomized 
controlled trial comparing COMET-SSI (n=409) with an 8-week waiting list control 
(n=419). Participants were recruited from the web-based workspace Prolific and 
assessed for depression, anxiety, work and social functioning, psychological 
well-being, and emotion regulation at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after 
the intervention. The main outcomes were short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (8 
weeks) changes in depression and anxiety. The secondary outcomes were the 8-week 
changes in work and social functioning, well-being, and emotion regulation. 
Analyses were conducted according to the intent-to-treat principle with 
imputation, without imputation, and using a per-protocol sample. In addition, we 
conducted sensitivity analyses to identify inattentive responders.
RESULTS: The sample comprised 61.9% (513/828) of women, with a mean age of 35.75 
(SD 11.93) years. Most participants (732/828, 88.3%) met the criteria for 
screening for depression or anxiety using at least one validated screening 
scale. A review of the text data suggested that adherence to the COMET-SSI was 
near perfect, there were very few inattentive respondents, and satisfaction with 
the intervention was high. However, despite being powered to detect small 
effects, there were negligible differences between the conditions in the various 
outcomes at the various time points, even when focusing on subsets of 
individuals with more severe symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of the COMET-SSI in adult 
Prolific participants. Future work should explore alternate ways of intervening 
with paid web-based participants, including matching individuals to SSIs they 
may be most responsive to.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is efficacious and recommended for 
insomnia, but availability is scarce. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia 
self-help interventions could increase availability, especially if unguided. 
Optimizing cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia methods and system 
user-friendliness, we developed a short, digital, self-help 
programme-FastAsleep-based on the behavioural components of sleep restriction 
and stimulus control. This study investigated its feasibility and preliminary 
effects. Thirty media-recruited participants with moderate to severe insomnia 
were assessed via telephone before using FastAsleep for 4 weeks, and were 
interviewed afterwards. Self-ratings with web questionnaires were conducted at 
screening, pre-, mid- and post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Primary 
outcomes were feasibility (credibility, adherence, system user-friendliness and 
adverse effects), and secondary outcomes were changes in symptom severity 
(insomnia, depression and anxiety). Adherence was generally high, participants' 
feasibility ratings were favourable, and adverse effects matched previously 
reported levels for cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. Symptoms of 
insomnia decreased after the treatment period (Hedge's g = 1.79, 95% confidence 
interval = 1.20-2.39), as did symptoms of depression and anxiety. FastAsleep can 
be considered feasible and promising for alleviating insomnia symptoms among 
patients fit for self-care. Future controlled trials are needed to establish the 
efficacy of FastAsleep and its suitability in a stepped care model.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of digital psychological interventions in 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unclear. We aimed to 
systematically investigate the available evidence for digital psychological 
interventions in reducing mental health problems in LMICs.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, 
PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from 
database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials 
investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental 
health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital 
delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic 
orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of 
guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate 
effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, 
the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be 
aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised 
mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control 
conditions (Hedges'g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary 
outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by 
self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with 
PROSPERO, CRD42019137755.
FINDINGS: We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the 
meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 
who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the 
control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study 
population was 20-35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results 
showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when 
compared with control interventions (Hedges'g 0·60 [95% CI 0·45-0·75]; Hedges'g 
with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 0·54 [0·35-0·73]). Heterogeneity 
between studies was substantial (I2=74% [95% CI 60-83]). There was no evidence 
of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria 
was generally high.
INTERPRETATION: Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly 
studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to 
control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs. 
However, the considerable heterogeneity observed in our analysis highlights the 
need for more studies to be done, with standardised implementation of digital 
psychological intervention programmes to improve their reproducibility and 
efficiency. Digital psychological interventions should be considered for regions 
where usual care for mental health problems is minimal or absent.

BACKGROUND: University students are increasingly reporting common mental health 
problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and they frequently face 
barriers to seeking psychological support because of stigma, cost, and 
availability of mental health services. This issue is even more critical in the 
challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, 
such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to 
achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and 
supporting prevention.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation 
measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot 
supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of 
university students.
METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited 
during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their 
first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled 
students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks 
(eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based 
on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness 
techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with 
audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to 
complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale 
(GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess 
effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement Scale-Short 
Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative 
comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention.
RESULTS: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) 
times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants 
completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement 
(10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the 
full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% 
attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in 
anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t39=0.94; 
P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t39=2.00; 
P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved 
significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ 
subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the 
chatbot.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the benefit of deploying a digital healthy-coping 
intervention via a chatbot to support university students experiencing higher 
levels of distress. While findings collected during the COVID-19 pandemic show 
promise, further research is required to confirm conclusions.

IMPORTANCE: Although digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) 
has been studied in many randomized clinical trials and is recommended as a 
first-line treatment option, few studies have systematically examined its 
effectiveness, engagement, durability, and adaptability in clinical settings.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, engagement, durability, and 
adaptability of dCBT-I.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted 
using longitudinal data collected via a mobile app named Good Sleep 365 between 
November 14, 2018, and February 28, 2022. Three therapeutic modes (ie, dCBT-I, 
medication, and their combination) were compared at month 1, month 3, and month 
6 (primary). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity 
scores was applied to enable homogeneous comparisons between the 3 groups.
EXPOSURES: Treatment with dCBT-I, medication therapy, or combination therapy 
according to prescriptions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score and 
its essential subitems were used as the primary outcomes. Effectiveness on 
comorbid somnolence, anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms were used as 
secondary outcomes. Cohen d effect size, P value, and standardized mean 
difference (SMD) were used to measure differences in treatment outcomes. Changes 
in outcomes and response rates (≥3 points change in PSQI score) were also 
reported.
RESULTS: A total of 4052 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.29 [12.01] years; 3028 
[74.7%] female participants) were selected for dCBT-I (n = 418), medication 
(n = 862), and their combination (n = 2772). Compared with the change in PSQI 
score at 6 months for participants receiving medication alone (from a mean [SD] 
of 12.85 [3.49] to 8.92 [4.03]), both dCBT-I (from a mean [SD] of 13.51 [3.03] 
to 7.15 [3.25]; Cohen d, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.38; P < .001; SMD = 0.484) 
and combination therapy (from a mean [SD] of 12.92 [3.49] to 6.98 [3.43]; Cohen 
d, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.58; P < .001; SMD = 0.518) were associated with 
significant reductions; dCBT-I had a comparable effect as combination therapy 
(Cohen d, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.15; P = .66; SMD = 0.05), but showed unstable 
durability. Outcomes of dCBT-I improved steadily and rapidly during the first 3 
months, and then fluctuated. The response rates with dCBT-I and combination 
therapy were higher than with medication. Changes in secondary outcomes 
indicated statistically significant benefits from dCBT-I and combination 
therapy. The results of subgroup analysis were consistent with the main 
findings, demonstrating the superiority of dCBT-I vs medication therapy in 
various subpopulations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, clinical evidence suggested that 
combination therapy was optimal, and dCBT-I was more effective than medication 
therapy, with long-term benefits for insomnia. Future studies are needed to 
analyze its clinical effectiveness and reliability in distinct subpopulations.

INTRODUCTION: Preoperative anxiety and depression have been shown to increase 
postoperative pain and opioid consumption by up to 50% in patients undergoing 
primary unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesized that the use 
of a telemedicine-based digital Cognitive Behavioral Intervention program 
(RxWell®) started one month prior to surgery would control anxiety and 
depression prior to surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled trial that enrolled 
patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA. At least a month prior to surgery, 
patients who gave consent to participate were asked to complete PROMIS® 
(Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) emotional anxiety 
short form 8a and PROMIS® emotional depression short form-8a questionnaires. 
Patients with T-scores of ≥ 57 were randomized to either a no intervention 
(control group) or a RxWell® program (treatment group) for a month prior to 
surgery. The primary outcome of this proof-of-concept study was the ability of 
the RxWell® to normalize patients' PROMIS anxiety T scores.
RESULTS: T scores for anxiety and depression among patients randomized to the 
RxWell® group significantly decreased from 64.3 ± 3.0 at the time of 
randomization to 58.5 ± 2.6 prior to surgery (n=5, p=0.006), whereas no changes 
in T scores were recorded in the control group (59.4 ± 4.2 at the time of 
randomization vs. 57.7 ± 6.2; n=6, p=0.559).
CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that the use of a RxWell® program 
represents an effective approach to control anxiety and depression prior to 
surgery. In contrast, it seems that in the absence of treatment, anxiety level 
remains similar over a month prior to surgery.

INTRODUCTION: There are unmet mental health needs of depressed adolescents and 
young adults (AYAs) across the USA. Behavioural technology adequately integrated 
into clinical care delivery has potential to improve care access and efficiency. 
This multisite randomised controlled trial evaluates how a coach-enhanced 
digital cognitive behavioural intervention (dCBI) enhances usual care for 
depressed AYAs in paediatric practices with minority enriched samples.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants (n=750) ages 16-22 who meet threshold 
criteria for depressive severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9 score 
10-24) will be recruited through paediatric practices across three academic 
institutions (Boston, Pittsburgh and San Diego). Participants will be randomised 
to 12 weeks of dCBI+treatment as usual (TAU) (n=450) or TAU alone (n=300) in 
outpatient paediatric practices. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 
weeks and 12 weeks with the primary outcome being improvement in clinician-rated 
and self-reported depressive severity (Children's Depression Rating 
Scale-Revised and PHQ-9) and secondary outcomes being self-reported suicidal 
ideation (item 9 on PHQ-9), anxiety severity (Generalised Anxiety Disorder), 
general quality of life (Satisfaction with Life Scale) and general functioning 
(Children's Global Assessment Scale). The study design is an intent-to-treat 
mixed effects regression with group, and covariates nested within the sites.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All participants or their parent/guardian (under 18 
years or unemancipated) will give informed consent to a study team member. All 
data are expected to be collected over 18 months. The Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) is a board at each institution in the United States that reviews and 
monitors research involving human subjects. IRB approval from the University of 
Pittsburgh was obtained on 30 November 2021 (STUDY21080150), from the University 
of California San Diego's Human Research Protection Program IRB on 14 July 2022 
(802047), and from the Boston Children's Hospital IRB on 25 October 2022 
(P00040987). Full study results are planned to be published within 2 years of 
initial study recruitment (October 2024). Dissemination of findings will occur 
in peer-reviewed journals, professional conferences and through reports to 
participating entities and stakeholders.

Background: There is a significant lack of outcomes research examining the 
effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing suicidal ideation and 
self-harm.Aims: To systematically review the effectiveness of digital 
interventions for reducing suicidal ideation and self-harm in adult populations. 
The possible mediating effects of depression are also discussed.Methods: The 
databases Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, IEEEXplore, ACM and CRESP were 
searched. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 
were used. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and risk of bias 
using standard assessment criteria.Results: Fourteen RCTs were reviewed, 
reporting data on 3455 participants. Although findings were more consistent for 
the effectiveness of online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), 
Mindfulness-Based CBT and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there was 
insufficient research to consider any as evidence-based treatments for suicidal 
ideation and self-harm.Conclusions: Digital interventions for suicidal ideation 
and self-harm can be a safe and acceptable option for individuals unwilling or 
unable to access face-to-face interventions. However, further research is needed 
to understand the types of interventions that could support people and the 
risk-benefit ratio of digital interventions for these individuals.

Chronic exposure to stressors and potentially psychologically traumatic events 
contributes to the high prevalence of mental health disorders in correctional 
workers (CWs) and other public safety personnel (PSP). Digital mental health 
interventions are an accessible and scalable method of improving and maintaining 
the mental health of this population. The current review explores the benefits 
of digital mental health interventions for PSP-with a focus on CWs-and how these 
innovations can address the limitations in in-person mental health care. A 
systematic literature search of five databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, 
CINAHL, Google Scholar) was conducted until March 2022. The search yielded 16 
publications that focused on digital mental health interventions or care 
available to CWs and other PSP. The benefits of digital innovations were 
summarized into five categories which discussed (1) their ability to enhance 
accessibility and reduce stigma; (2) the provision of evidence-based and 
structured psychotherapy programs; (3) variability in the degree of therapist 
engagement; (4) the integration of proactive interventions; and (5) enhancing 
engagement by acknowledging unique experiences and interpersonal relationships. 
Although digital mental health technologies for CWs are still in their infancy, 
there is strong evidence to support their effectiveness in ameliorating symptoms 
of mental distress. Future research should consider how ethnicity, gender, 
culture, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status can be integrated into 
these therapies and how the interplay between different stakeholders and 
organizations can impact the effectiveness of online therapies and programs.

BACKGROUND: People living with cancer face numerous psychosocial challenges, 
including cancer-related fatigue, fear of recurrence, and depression. There is a 
lack of digital interventions tailored to the needs of people living with all 
types of cancer. We developed a 6-week, digital, peer-delivered, self-management 
program: iHOPE (Help to Overcome Problems Effectively; where 'i' indicates the 
digital version of the program). The program is underpinned by positive 
psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy to meet these psychosocial 
challenges.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the iHOPE program among 
people living with cancer. Program adherence and satisfaction along with changes 
in psychological distress and positive well-being were measured.
METHODS: A pre-post, acceptability, and feasibility design was used. People 
living with cancer (N=114) were recruited via a national cancer charity in the 
United Kingdom and were given access to the iHOPE program. Demographic and other 
participant characteristics were recorded. Participants completed digital 
measures at baseline and the end of the 6-week program for depression, anxiety, 
cancer-related fatigue, cancer worry or fear of cancer recurrence, positive 
mental well-being, hope, gratitude, and health status. The website's system 
recorded data on the usage of the program. Satisfaction with the program was 
also measured.
RESULTS: A total of 114 participants completed the baseline questionnaires. Of 
these, 70 people (61.4%) participated in all 6 sessions. The mean number of 
sessions undertaken was 5.0 (SD 1.5). Moreover, 44.7% (51/114) of participants 
completed at least three sessions and end-of-program outcome measures. A total 
of 59 participants completed the satisfaction questionnaire, where ≥90% (54/58) 
of participants reported that the program was easy to navigate and was well 
managed by the peer facilitators, and that they found the social networking 
tools useful. Preliminary efficacy testing among the 51 participants who 
completed baseline and postprogram outcome measures showed that postprogram 
scores decreased for depression, anxiety, cancer-related fatigue, and fear of 
recurrence (all P<.001) and increased for positive mental well-being (P<.001), 
hope (both P<.001), and gratitude (P=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility evidence is promising, showing that the 
peer-delivered digital iHOPE program is acceptable and practical. Implementation 
of the iHOPE program on a wider scale will incorporate further research and 
development to maximize the completion rates of the measures. Initial 
effectiveness data suggest positive impacts on important cancer-related quality 
of life and mental well-being outcomes. A randomized controlled trial design 
with a longer follow-up is needed to confirm the potential of the iHOPE program 
for improving mental and physical health outcomes for cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: Depression is common among homebound older adults. Internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is a promising but understudied approach for 
treating depression among older adults with disabilities.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the experiences of homebound older 
adults who participated in a pilot feasibility trial of an iCBT for depression.
METHODS: The participants included 21 homebound older adults who participated in 
a generic iCBT program that was not specifically designed for older adults and 8 
home care workers who assisted in the iCBT program. Informants completed 
semistructured individual interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and 
analyzed using methods informed by grounded theory. A hierarchical code 
structure of themes and subthemes was developed after an iterative process of 
constant comparisons and questionings of the initial codes. The data analysis 
was conducted by using dedoose, a web app for mixed methods research.
RESULTS: Three themes and various subthemes emerged related to participants' 
experience of the iCBT intervention, as follows: intervention impact, which 
involved subthemes related to participants' perceived impact of the 
intervention; challenges and difficulties, which involved subthemes on the 
challenges and difficulties that participants experienced in the intervention; 
and facilitators, which involved subthemes on the factors that facilitated 
intervention use and engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: iCBT is a promising intervention for homebound older adults 
experiencing depression. Home care workers reported improved relationships with 
their clients and that the program did not add a burden to their duties. Future 
programs should involve accessible technical features and age-adapted content to 
improve user experience, uptake, and adherence.

BACKGROUND: Digital interventions delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
insomnia (Digital CBTi) may increase utilization of effective care for a common 
and serious condition. A low-intensity implementation strategy may facilitate 
digital CBTi use in healthcare settings. This pilot study assessed the 
feasibility of implementing a digital CBTi in Veterans Health Administration 
(VA) primary care through iterative modifications to a low-intensity 
implementation strategy, while evaluating clinical outcomes of a specific 
digital CBTi program.
METHODS: A self-directed digital CBTi was implemented in the primary care 
clinics of a single VA facility using a cohort trial design that iteratively 
modified an implementation strategy over three 8-month phases. The phase 1 
implementation strategy included (1) provider education; (2) point-of-care 
information via pamphlets; and (3) provider referral to digital CBTi through 
phone calls or messages. Phases 2 and 3 maintained these activities, while (1) 
adding a clinic-based coach who performed initial patient education and 
follow-up support contacts, (2) providing additional recruitment pathways, and 
(3) integrating the referral mechanism into provider workflow. Implementation 
outcomes included provider adoption, patient adoption, and acceptability. 
Clinical outcomes (insomnia severity, depression severity, and sedative hypnotic 
use) were compared among enrollees at baseline and 10 weeks.
RESULTS: Across all phases 66 providers (48.9%) made 153 referrals, representing 
0.38% of unique clinic patients. Of referrals, 77 (50.3%) enrolled in the study, 
45 (29.4%) engaged in the program, and 24 (15.7%) completed it. Provider and 
patient adoption did not differ meaningfully across phases. Among enrollees, 
digital CBTi was acceptable and the Insomnia Severity Index decreased by 4.3 
points (t = 6.41, p < 0.001) and 13 (18.6%) reached remission. The mean number 
of weakly sedative-hypnotic doses decreased by 2.2 (35.5%) (t = 2.39, p < 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBTi implementation in VA primary care is feasible using 
low-intensity implementation strategy, resulting in improved clinical outcomes 
for users. However, iterative implementation strategy modifications did not 
improve adoption.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03151083).

OBJECTIVES: Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective for prenatal insomnia, but 
unresolved cognitive arousal limits patient outcomes. Therapies aimed at 
reducing cognitive arousal may benefit pregnant women with insomnia. This 
proof-of-concept trial evaluated Perinatal Understanding of Mindful Awareness 
for Sleep (PUMAS, which combines mindfulness with behavioral sleep strategies) 
on insomnia, depression, and cognitive arousal.
METHODS: A single-arm trial of 12 pregnant women with DSM-5 insomnia disorder 
(n = 5/12 with comorbid depression) who received six sessions of PUMAS delivered 
individually via telemedicine. Pretreatment and posttreatment outcomes included 
the insomnia severity index (ISI), Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS), 
pre-sleep arousal scale's cognitive factor (PSASC; nocturnal cognitive arousal), 
perinatal-focused rumination (appended to PSASC), and Glasgow sleep effort 
scale.
RESULTS: Eleven of 12 patients completed all sessions. Intent-to-treat analyses 
revealed a 10.83-point reduction in ISI (Cohen's dz = 3.05), resulting in 83.3% 
insomnia remission. PUMAS produced large reductions in EPDS (Cohen's dz = 2.76 
in depressed group), resulting in all five baseline depressed patients remitting 
from depression. PUMAS produced large reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal, 
perinatal-focused rumination, and sleep effort (all Cohen's dzs>2.00). Patients 
were highly satisfied with PUMAS and identified the telemedicine format and 
meditation app as positive features of its delivery. Patients rated sleep 
restriction and guided meditations as the most helpful treatment components.
CONCLUSION: Prenatal insomnia patients were highly engaged in PUMAS, which 
produced large acute reductions in insomnia, depression, and cognitive arousal. 
These findings support the concept and feasibility of PUMAS for pregnant women 
with insomnia who present with or without comorbid depression.

BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions are considered a key factor 
in the etiology and maintenance of depression. In cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT), the current gold-standard psychotherapeutic treatment for depression, 
cognitive restructuring techniques are employed to address dysfunctional 
cognitions. However, high drop-out and non-response rates suggest a need to 
boost the efficacy of CBT for depression. This might be achieved by enhancing 
the role of emotional and kinesthetic (i.e., body movement perception) features 
of interventions. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive 
restructuring task augmented with the performance of anti-depressive facial 
expressions in individuals with and without depression. Further, we aim to 
investigate to what extent kinesthetic markers are intrinsically associated with 
and, hence, allow for the detection of, depression.
METHODS: In a four-arm, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial 
(RCT), we will randomize 128 individuals with depression and 128 matched 
controls without depression to one of four study conditions: (1) a cognitive 
reappraisal training (CR); (2) CR enhanced with instructions to display 
anti-depressive facial expressions (CR + AFE); (3) facial muscle training 
focusing on anti-depressive facial expressions (AFE); and (4) a sham control 
condition. One week after diagnostic assessment, a single intervention of 
90-120-minute duration will be administered, with a subsequent follow-up two 
weeks later. Depressed mood will serve as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes 
will include current positive mood, symptoms of depression, current suicidality, 
dysfunctional attitudes, automatic thoughts, emotional state, kinesthesia (i.e., 
facial expression, facial muscle activity, body posture), psychophysiological 
measures (e.g., heart rate (variability), respiration rate (variability), verbal 
acoustics), as well as feasibility measures (i.e., treatment integrity, 
compliance, usability, acceptability). Outcomes will be analyzed with multiple 
methods, such as hierarchical and conventional linear models and machine 
learning.
DISCUSSION: If shown to be feasible and effective, the inclusion of kinesthesia 
into both psychotherapeutic diagnostics and interventions may be a pivotal step 
towards the more prompt, efficient, and targeted treatment of individuals with

Regular assessment of the effectiveness of behavioral interventions is a potent 
tool for improving their relevance to patients. However, poor provider and 
patient adherence characterize most measurement-based care tools. Therefore, a 
new approach for measuring intervention effects and communicating them to 
providers in a seamless manner is warranted. This paper provides a brief 
overview of the available research evidence on novel ways to measure the effects 
of behavioral treatments, integrating both objective and subjective data. We 
highlight the importance of analyzing therapeutic conversations through natural 
language processing. We then suggest a conceptual framework for capitalizing on 
data captured through directly collected and nondisruptive methodologies to 
describe the client's characteristics and needs and inform clinical 
decision-making. We then apply this context in exploring a new tool to integrate 
the content of therapeutic conversations and patients' self-reports. We present 
a case study of how both subjective and objective measures of treatment effects 
were implemented in cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression and anxiety 
and then utilized in treatment planning, delivery, and termination. In this 
tool, called Eleos, the patient completes standardized measures of depression 
and anxiety. The content of the treatment sessions was evaluated using 
nondisruptive, independent measures of conversation content, fidelity to the 
treatment model, and the back-and-forth of client-therapist dialogue. Innovative 
applications of advances in digital health are needed to disseminate empirically 
supported interventions and measure them in a noncumbersome way. Eleos appears 
to be a feasible, sustainable, and effective way to assess behavioral health 
care.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health services (DMHS) provide highly accessible 
psychological supports and interventions that can supplement existing mental 
health services. Concerns about the mental health impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic have been widespread and provide a unique impetus to examine the 
utility and responsivity of DMHS. This study examined the service utilisation 
and user characteristics of two DMHS (THIS WAY UP and Just a Thought) in 
Australia and New Zealand before and during the early pandemic period in these 
countries (March to June 2020).
METHODS: Service use indices (website visits, course registrations and 
prescriptions, clinician registrations) were compared across different time 
periods before (12, 6 and 3 months) and during the pandemic in Australia and New 
Zealand. The demographic and clinical characteristics of course registrants 
(anxiety and depression symptom severity and psychological distress) were also 
compared across the pre- and during-COVID periods.
RESULTS: Comparing pre-COVID to during-COVID time periods, we observed 
substantial increases across all service use indices in both DMHS (increases of 
>100% on the majority of service use indices). For example, in the 3 months 
prior to the pandemic, 2806 people registered for a THIS WAY UP course and 1907 
people registered for a Just a Thought course, whereas 21,872 and 5442 
registered for a THIS WAY UP and Just a Thought course, respectively, during the 
first 3 months of the COVID pandemic. Slight differences in the demographic and 
clinical profiles of course registrants were found between pre- and during-COVID 
time periods, with limited evidence of elevated anxiety and depression symptom 
severity in the COVID period.
CONCLUSIONS: Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Australia and New Zealand, 
the volume of users accessing DMHS increased yet the demographic and clinical 
characteristics of course registrants remained stable. Results underscore how 
nimble and scalable DMHS can be during periods of high demand.

Depression prevalence is high, impacting approximately 20% of Americans during 
their lifetime, and on the rise due to stress and loss associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the high prevalence of depression, unacceptable 
treatment access disparities persist. When depression goes untreated, it leads 
to substantial negative impacts in multiple life domains. Cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychosocial treatment for depression, remains 
largely unavailable to individuals living with depression, particularly 
individuals who are members of underrepresented groups in our society. Digital 
mental health interventions (DMHI) have led to important advances in extending 
the reach of CBT for depression; however, they are underutilized and treatment 
engagement remains low. We sought to address some of the current gaps in DMHI by 
developing an online platform for delivering CBT for depression that is 
entertaining, simple and straightforward, and tailorable. First, this article 
introduces our online platform, Entertain Me Well (EMW) and its key innovations, 
including the use of an engaging, character-driven storyline presented as 
"episodes" within each session, as well as customizable content that allows for 
tailoring of text, images, and examples to create content most relevant to the 
target client population, context, or setting. Next, we describe two EMW 
depression treatment programs that have been tailored: one for delivery in the 
rural church setting, called Raising Our Spirits Together, and one tailored for 
delivery in dialysis centers, called Doing Better on Dialysis. Finally, we 
discuss future directions for the EMW platform, including the ability to create 
programs for other common mental health and health conditions, the development 
of additional character-driven storylines with greater treatment 
personalization, translation of content in multiple languages, and the use of 
additional technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence like 
natural language processing, to enhance platform interactivity.

This review summarizes the effectiveness of scalable mind-body internet and 
mobile-based interventions (IMIs) on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults 
living with chronic physical conditions. Six databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
SCOPUS, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL) were searched for randomized controlled 
trials published from database inception to March 2023. Mind-body IMIs included 
cognitive behavioral therapy, breathwork, meditation, mindfulness, yoga or 
Tai-chi. To focus on interventions with a greater potential for scale, the 
intervention delivery needed to be online with no or limited facilitation by 
study personnel. The primary outcome was mean change scores for anxiety and 
depression (Hedges' g). In subgroup analyses, random-effects models were used to 
calculate pooled effect size estimates based on personnel support level, 
intervention techniques, chronic physical condition, and survey type. 
Meta-regression was conducted on age and intervention length. Fifty-six studies 
met inclusion criteria (sample size 7691, mean age of participants 43 years, 58% 
female): 30% (n = 17) neurological conditions, 12% (n = 7) cardiovascular 
conditions, 11% cancer (n = 6), 43% other chronic physical conditions (n = 24), 
and 4% (n = 2) multiple chronic conditions. Mind-body IMIs demonstrated 
statistically significant pooled reductions in depression (SMD = -0.33 [-0.40, 
-0.26], p<0.001) and anxiety (SMD = -0.26 [-0.36, -0.17], p<0.001). 
Heterogeneity was moderate. Scalable mind-body IMIs hold promise as 
interventions for managing anxiety and depression symptoms in adults with 
chronic physical conditions without differences seen with age or intervention 
length. While modest, the effect sizes are comparable to those seen with 
pharmacological therapy. The field would benefit from detailed reporting of 
participant demographics including those related to technological proficiency, 
as well as further evaluation of non-CBT interventions. Registration: The study 
is registered with PROSPERO ID #CRD42022375606.

A rather large body of literature now exists on the use of telemental health 
services in the diagnosis and management of various psychiatric conditions. This 
review aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of telemental health, focusing 
on four main areas: computerized CBT (cCBT), Internet-based CBT (iCBT), virtual 
reality exposure therapy (VRET), and mobile therapy (mTherapy). Four scientific 
databases were searched and, where possible, larger, better-designed 
meta-analyses and controlled trials were highlighted. Taken together, published 
studies support an expanded role for telepsychiatry tools, with advantages that 
include increased care access, enhanced efficiency, reduced stigma associated 
with visiting mental health clinics, and the ability to bypass 
diagnosis-specific obstacles to treatment, such as when social anxiety prevents 
a patient from leaving the house. Of technology-mediated therapies, cCBT and 
iCBT possess the most efficacy evidence, with VRET and mTherapy representing 
promising but less researched options that have grown in parallel with virtual 
reality and mobile technology advances. Nonetheless, telepsychiatry remains 
challenging because of the need for specific computer skills, the difficulty in 
providing patients with a deep understanding or support, concerns about the 
"therapeutic alliance", privacy fears, and the well documented problem of 
patient attrition. Future studies should further test the efficacy, advantages 
and limitations of technology-enabled CBT, as well as explore the online 
delivery of other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological modalities.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies worldwide have reported the beneficial 
effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I). However, 
few focus on real-world study samples that reflect people in regular care. To 
test whether dCBT-I is suitable within German regular care, we designed a 
randomized controlled trial recruiting a heterogenous insomnia population.
METHODS: Participants aged ≥18 who met the criteria for insomnia disorder were 
randomized to 8-weeks dCBT-I + care-as-usual (CAU) or they were set on a 
waitlist + CAU. The intervention group was followed-up at 6- and 12-months. The 
primary outcome was self-reported insomnia severity, assessed with the Insomnia 
Severity Index (ISI) at 8-weeks post-randomization. A one-way ANCOVA with 
baseline score as a covariate was fitted to determine group differences. 
Secondary outcomes included measures of daytime functioning, quality of life, 
depression, anxiety, dreams, and nightmares.
RESULTS: Of the N = 238 participants (67.6% female), age range 19-81 years, 
n = 118 were randomized to dCBT-I and n = 120 to the control group. At 
posttreatment, the use of dCBT-I was associated with a large reduction in the 
ISI (Diffadj = -7.60) in comparison to WLC (d = -2.08). This clinical 
improvement was also reflected in responder and remission rates. Treatment 
effects were also observed for daytime functioning, quality of life, symptoms of 
depression and anxiety (ds = 0.26-1.02) and at long-term follow-up (intervention 
group only; ds = 0.18-1.65). No effects were found for dream and nightmare 
frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that dCBT-I reduces insomnia symptoms and 
improves daytime functioning in a heterogenous insomnia population in Germany 
with sustained long-term treatment effects in the intervention group. Our 
results underscore the potential of digital health applications, their 
suitability within regular care, and their role in facilitating widespread 
implementation of CBT-I as a first-line treatment for insomnia.

Internet-supported and therapist-guided cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is 
effective for a range of problems in the short run, but less is known about the 
long-term effects with follow-ups of two years or longer. Areas covered: This 
paper reviews studies in which the long-term effects of guided ICBT were 
investigated. Following literature searches in PubMed and other sources 
meta-analytic statistics were calculated for 14 studies involving a total of 902 
participants, and an average follow-up period of three years. Studies were from 
Sweden (n = 11) or the Netherlands (n = 3). Long-term outcome studies were found 
for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
depression, mixed anxiety and depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
pathological gambling, stress and chronic fatigue. The duration of the 
treatments was usually short (8-15 weeks). The pre-to follow-up effect size was 
Hedge's g = 1.52, but with a significant heterogeneity. The average symptom 
improvement across studies was 50%. Treatment seeking in the follow-up period 
was not documented and few studies mentioned negative effects. Expert 
commentary: While effects may be overestimated, it is likely that 
therapist-supported ICBT can have enduring effects. Long-term follow-up data 
should be collected for more conditions and new technologies like 
smartphone-delivered treatments.

The use of embodied conversational agents in mental health has increased in the 
last years. Several studies exist describing the benefits and advantages of this 
technology as a complement to psychotherapeutic interventions for the prevention 
and treatment of depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder, to name 
a few. A small number of these works implement capabilities in the virtual agent 
focused on the detection and prevention of suicidality risks. The work presented 
in this paper describes the development of an embodied conversational agent used 
as the main interface in HelPath, a mobile-based application addressed to 
individuals detected with any of the suicidal behaviours: ideation, planning or 
attempt. The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's 
information that, complemented with data from the electronic health record, 
supports the identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the 
virtual agent, the users also receive information and suggestions based on 
cognitive behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy 
condition. The paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to 
assess the acceptability, perception and adherence of users towards the virtual 
agent. The obtained results are presented and discussed, and some actions for 
further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified.

Digital therapeutics (DTx) offer evidence-based digitally-delivered high quality 
standards applications and/or softwares in the prevention, management and 
treatment of several medical conditions, including mood disorders. Nowadays, 
there are only three DTx officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for mental conditions and there are still very few DTx developed in the context 
of mood disorders. The current comprehensive overview aims at providing a 
summary of currently published studies on DTx clinical applications in major 
depressive disorder (MDD), depressive symptomatology and bipolar disorder (BD), 
by using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Fifteen studies have been selected 
(10 on DTx in depressive symptomatology and/or MDD; 4 on BD; 1 on MDD and BD). 
Literature on DTx in mood disorders is still lacking, being mostly constituted 
by feasibility and acceptability rather than efficacy/effectiveness outcomes, 
particularly in BD. More studies focused on MDD compared to BD. Most DTx on MDD 
have been developed based on cognitive behaviour therapy interventions while on 
BD are based on psychoeducation. All studies assessing symptom severity 
improvement pre- vs. postinterventions demonstrated a significant 
postintervention improvement. Therefore, despite the preliminary encouraging 
results of studies here retrieved, their methodology is still too heterogeneous 
to allow comparisons and the generalizability of their findings. Further studies 
are warranted, in more larger samples involving multiple sites, including 
measures of both specific symptom effects as well as acceptability, feasibility 
and effectiveness in the real-world settings.

INTRODUCTION: Emotional disorders (EDs) have become the most prevalent 
psychological disorders in the general population, which has boosted the 
economic burden associated with their management. Approximately half of the 
individuals do not receive adequate treatment. Consequently, finding solutions 
to deliver cost-effective treatments for EDs has become a key goal of today's 
clinical psychology. Blended treatments, a combination of face-to-face and 
online interventions, have emerged as a potential solution to the previous. The 
Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of EDs (UP) might serve this 
purpose, as it can be applied to a variety of disorders simultaneously and its 
manualised format makes it suitable for blended interventions.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a multicentre, randomised, superiority, 
clinical trial. Participants will be 310 individuals with a diagnosis of an ED. 
They will be randomised to a treatment as usual (individual cognitive 
behavioural therapy) or a UP condition in a blended format (face-to-face 
individual UP +online, app-based UP). Primary outcomes will be ED diagnostic 
criteria and depression and anxiety symptoms. Cost efficiency of the 
intervention, app usability, as well as opinion and confidence in the treatment 
will also be evaluated. Assessment points will include baseline and 3 months, 6 
months and 12 months after UP treatment.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approvals by the Ethics 
Research Committee of Navarra, Castellón, Euskadi, Castilla y León, Extremadura, 
Lleida and Aragón. The study is currently under an approval process by the 
Ethics Research Committees of all the remaining collaborating centres. Outcomes 
will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and 
presentations at international conference meetings.

INTRODUCTION: Youth mental health services are characterised by high demand and 
modest clinical outcomes. While digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have 
been shown to be clinically effective, the relationship between DMHI use and 
outcome is unclear. The current study sought to identify the factors affecting 
the relationship between DMHI use and depression and anxiety symptom improvement 
in sub-groups of young people.
METHOD: An observational cohort design included young people aged 12-25 years 
engaging with a DMHI (MOST) from October 2020 to October 2023. The primary 
outcome was improvement at 12 weeks on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 
(PHQ4). DMHIs were combinations of self-paced digital cognitive-behavioural 
therapy content, social network interactions, and professional support. A 
machine learning clustering algorithm was used to identify distinct user 
clusters based on baseline characteristics and multiple logistic regression 
models examined the relationship between DMHI usage and improvement.
RESULTS: Two distinct user clusters emerged, differing by symptom severity, age, 
service setting, and concurrent external treatment. 46.7% of "Severe" users and 
39.8% of "Mild-Moderate" users significantly improved. Greater use of therapy 
content and professional support interactions were associated with improvement 
for the Mild-Moderate group only (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30, p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: While a greater proportion of users in the Severe group 
significantly improved, increased MOST use was associated with symptom 
improvement only for the Mild-Moderate group. These findings highlight the 
complexity of the relationship between DMHI use and outcome. Other unmeasured 
mediating or moderating factors such concurrent 'offline' treatment may help 
explain the results. Further research is required to better understand the 
relationship between DMHI use and clinical outcomes.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a substantial portion of society to 
multiple stressors, while access to mental health care was limited. To address 
this, we introduced a digital stepped-care program rooted in 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, aiming to alleviate mental health 
distress among the general public seeking help. Methods: The program comprises a 
4-week digital application using "Aury" the chatbot, followed by an optional 
6-week online group session for those still symptomatic. A 4-week waiting period 
separated these steps. Participants entered based on self-identified mental 
health concerns. Interventions addressed prevalent pandemic mental health 
issues: sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, worry/rumination, interpersonal 
issues, and resource mobilization. Outcomes focused on depressive, anxiety, and 
somatic symptoms, assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Results: 
Of the 1261 initial participants, postchatbot results (N = 142) indicated small 
to medium effects (d = 0.412 to d = 0.523). Those finishing the entire program 
(N = 41) saw substantial symptom decline with medium to large effects (d = 0.757 
to d = 0.818). No shifts were seen in the waiting phase. At follow-up 6 months 
after baseline, both groups-those who only used the chatbot (N = 60; d = 0.284 
to d = 0.416) and those who completed the entire program (N = 27; d = 0.854 to 
d = 0.926)-showed sustained symptom reduction. Comparing groups that received no 
intervention, used the chatbot only, and completed the entire program, we 
observed a dose-response effect. Conclusions: This resource-efficient and 
adaptable digital approach effectively reduced pandemic-induced mental health 
issues, indicating its potential in crisis periods with limited health 
resources. Randomized controlled trials are recommended for further validation.

BACKGROUND: Digital psychological interventions can target deficit-oriented and 
asset-oriented psychological outcomes in the workplace. This review examined: 
(a) the effectiveness of digital interventions for psychological well-being at 
work, (b) associations with workplace outcomes, and (c) associations between 
interventions' effectiveness and their theory-base.
METHODS: six electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials 
(RCT) and quasi-experimental studies. The methodological quality of studies that 
used randomisation was conducted with the "Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of 
Bias" tool, while the "JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist" was used for 
non-randomised studies. Studies' theory-base was evaluated using an adaptation 
of the "theory coding scheme" (TSC). Due to heterogeneity, narrative synthesis 
was performed.
RESULTS: 51 studies were included in a synthesis describing four clusters of 
digital interventions: (a) cognitive behavioural therapy, (b) stress-management 
interventions and workplace well-being promotion, (c) meditation training and 
mindfulness-based interventions, and (d) self-help interventions. Studies 
demonstrated a high risk of contamination effects and high attrition bias. 
Theory-informed interventions demonstrated greater effectiveness. Cognitive 
behavioural therapy demonstrated the most robust evidence for reducing 
depression symptoms among healthy employees. With the exception of the Headspace 
application, there was weak evidence for meditation training apps, while 
relaxation training was a key component of effective stress-management 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Recent novel digital interventions may be transformative in 
overcoming persistent barriers to access in-person psychological therapies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) of nonpharmacological interventions that prevents or treats 
anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilians 
recovering from physical traumatic injury.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar for articles since inception 
to December 28, 2023. We performed English-language RCTs of patients 18 years or 
older who sustained a physical injury and were assessed for symptoms of PTSD, 
depression, or anxiety within 1 year of injury. Dual reviewers performed 
screening for advancement to full-text review, data extraction, and final 
eligibility for systematic review and meta-analysis, and conflicts were resolved 
by the senior author. Meta-analysis used random effects. The primary outcome was 
standardized mean difference (SMD) between intervention and comparator groups.
RESULTS: We identified 3,001 articles for title and abstract review. Overall, 
nonpharmacological interventions significantly prevented or treated PTSD (pooled 
SMD, -0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.06 to -0.36), depression (pooled 
SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.17), and anxiety (pooled SMD, -0.69; 95% CI, 
-1.01 to -0.37). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was associated with 
decreased symptoms of PTSD (pooled SMD, -1.10; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.66), 
depression (pooled SMD, -0.87; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.52), and anxiety. Non-CBT 
significantly reduced anxiety (pooled SMD, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.07). 
Collaborative care, non-CBT, and digital treatments failed to reach significance 
for PTSD and depression.
CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs suggest efficacy of 
CBT for PTSD, depression, and anxiety and non-CBT for anxiety, after physical 
trauma.

BACKGROUND: Although grief and its symptoms constitute a normal reaction to 
experiences of loss, some of those affected still report elevated levels of 
distress after an extended period, often termed complicated grief. Beneficial 
treatment effects of face-to-face therapies, for example, grief counseling or 
cognitive behavioral therapy against complicated grief, have been reported. 
Evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions targeting symptoms of 
grief in bereaved individuals with regard to objective quality criteria are 
currently lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the 
effectiveness and feasibility of internet- and mobile-based interventions 
against symptoms of grief after bereavement.
METHODS: We conducted systematic literature searches of randomized controlled 
trials or feasibility studies published before January 9, 2020, following PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, 
in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Library. 
The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluations system. We further assessed aspects of 
feasibility and rated quality of interventions using criteria suggested by an 
expert panel on mental health care (German Association for Psychiatry, 
Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics). A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted 
to assess between-group effect sizes.
RESULTS: In total, 9 trials (N=1349) were included. Of these, 7 studies were 
analyzed meta-analytically. Significant effects were found for symptoms of grief 
(g=0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.77), depression (g=0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.68), and 
posttraumatic stress (g=0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.01). Heterogeneity was moderate for 
grief and depression (I2=48.75% and 55.19%, respectively) and low for 
posttraumatic stress symptoms (I2=0%). The overall quality of evidence was 
graded low (grief and depression) to moderate (posttraumatic stress). User 
satisfaction with the interventions was high, as was the quality of the 
interventions assessed using objective quality criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet- or mobile-based interventions might constitute an 
effective treatment approach against symptoms of grief in bereaved adults. 
However, the small sample sizes and limited number of studies included in the 
review warrant further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Depression impacts the lives of a large number of university 
students. Mobile-based therapy chatbots are increasingly being used to help 
young adults who suffer from depression. However, previous trials have short 
follow-up periods. Evidence of effectiveness in pragmatic conditions are still 
in lack.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which 
is a widely accepted and proven-useful self-help psychological intervention. The 
main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effectiveness for 
chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention 
for depression.
METHODS: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students 
was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test 
group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered intervention, or a 
bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of 
bibliotherapy. A set of questionnaires was implemented as measurements of 
clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period of 16 weeks, which 
included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The 
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Working Alliance 
Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and 
therapeutic alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported 
adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were also collected.
RESULTS: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students 
(n = 31), postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old 
(mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/83) female. 24.07% 
(20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was 
found at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the 
chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in the PHQ-9 scores 
(F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F = 5.37; P = 0.02). Follow-up 
analysis of completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant 
only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in the chatbot group were higher 
compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01). User feedback showed 
that process factors were more influential than the content factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven 
to be superior to the minimal level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on 
depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with participants.

BACKGROUND: The mental health chatbot is dedicated to providing assistance to 
individuals grappling with the complexities of depression and anxiety.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the mental health 
chatbot in alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety among adolescents and 
young adults.
METHODS: A systematic review framework was employed with a protocol 
pre-registered on Prospero (CRD42023418877). Databases were systematically 
searched, including PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Embase, Cochrane and IEEE. Data 
synthesis was conducted narratively, and meta-analysis was performed by pooling 
data from the original studies.
RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials focused on an acute population, mainly 
females and university students. Chatbots designed for daily conversations and 
mood monitoring, using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, showed efficacy 
in treating depression (95% CI = -1.09 to -0.23; p = .003). However, it is 
essential to highlight that these interventions utilizing chatbots for mental 
health were not found to be efficacious in managing symptoms of anxiety (95% 
CI = -0.56 to 0.4; p = .74).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the effectiveness of mental health chatbots in 
treating depression, but further exploration and refinement are needed to 
optimize their efficacy in managing anxiety.

INTRODUCTION: Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety are high, 
resulting in reduced work performance and absenteeism. There is evidence that 
digital mental health interventions delivered in the workplace are an effective 
way of treating these conditions, but intervention engagement and adherence 
remain a challenge. Providing guidance can lead to greater engagement and 
adherence; an online facilitated discussion group may be one way of providing 
that guidance in a time efficient way. This study compares engagement with a 
minimally guided digital mental health program (WorkGuru) delivered in the 
workplace with a discussion group (DG) and without a discussion group (MSG), and 
with a wait list control (WLC); it was conducted as a pilot phase of a 
definitive trial.
METHODS: Eighty four individuals with elevated levels of stress from six 
organisations were recruited to the study and randomised to one of two active 
conditions (DG or MSG) or a WLC. The program WorkGuru is a CBT based, eight-week 
stress management intervention that is delivered with minimal guidance from a 
coach. Data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 16-week 
follow-up via online questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was number of 
logins. Secondary measures included further engagement measures, and measures of 
depression, anxiety, stress, comfort and enthusiasm. Quality measures including 
satisfaction and system usability were also collected.
RESULTS: A greater number of logins was observed for the DG compared with the 
MSG; this was a medium between group effect size (d = 0.51; 95% CI: - 0.04, 
1.05). Small to medium effect size differences were found at T2 in favour of the 
active conditions compared with the control on the DASS subscales depression, 
anxiety and stress, and the IWP subscales enthusiasm and comfort. This was 
largely maintained at T3. Satisfaction with the intervention was high with 
individuals in the MSG reporting greater satisfaction than individuals in the 
DG.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that access to an online facilitated discussion 
group increases engagement with a minimally supported occupational digital 
mental health intervention (as defined by the number of logins), but that this 
doesn't necessarily result in improved psychological outcomes or increased 
satisfaction when compared to access to the intervention without the group. 
Access to the web-based program was associated with lower levels of depression, 
anxiety and stress and an increase in comfort and enthusiasm post intervention; 
these changes were largely maintained at follow-up.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mental health disorders among children and adolescents 
represent a significant global health challenge, with approximately 50% of 
conditions emerging before age 14. Despite substantial investment in services, 
persistent barriers such as provider shortages, stigma, and accessibility issues 
continue to limit effective care delivery. This narrative review examines the 
emerging application of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in pediatric 
mental health contexts, mapping the current evidence base, identifying 
therapeutic mechanisms, and exploring unique developmental considerations 
required for implementation.
METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus) for literature published between 
January 2010 and February 2025 that addressed conversational AI applications 
relevant to pediatric mental health. We employed a narrative synthesis approach 
with thematic analysis to organize findings across technological approaches, 
therapeutic applications, developmental considerations, implementation contexts, 
and ethical frameworks.
RESULTS: The review identified promising applications for conversational AI in 
pediatric mental health, particularly for common conditions like anxiety and 
depression, psychoeducation, skills practice, and bridging to traditional care. 
However, most robust empirical research has focused on adult populations, with 
pediatric applications only beginning to receive dedicated investigation. Key 
therapeutic mechanisms identified include reduced barriers to self-disclosure, 
cognitive change, emotional validation, and behavioral activation. Developmental 
considerations emerged as fundamental challenges, necessitating age-appropriate 
adaptations across cognitive, emotional, linguistic, and ethical dimensions 
rather than simple modifications of adult-oriented systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Conversational AI has potential to address significant unmet needs 
in pediatric mental health as a complement to, rather than replacement for, 
human-delivered care. Future research should prioritize developmental 
validation, longitudinal outcomes, implementation science, safety monitoring, 
and equity-focused design. Interdisciplinary collaboration involving children 
and families is essential to ensure these technologies effectively address the 
unique mental health needs of young people while mitigating potential risks.

Although the short-term efficacy of internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (i-CBT) is well-established, its long-term efficacy remains 
understudied. Robust variance estimation meta-analysis was thus conducted across 
guided and self-guided i-CBT, synthesizing data from 154 randomized controlled 
trials (N = 45,335) with ≥ 12-month follow-ups. For binary outcomes, guided 
(52.3% vs. 38.6%; log-risk ratio [LOG-RR] = 1.15 95% confidence interval [1.04, 
1.26]) yielded higher remission, reliable improvement, and response rates, and 
lower suboptimal treatment outcome rates (9.3% vs. 10.8%; LOG-RR = 0.63 [0.45, 
0.80]) than treatment-as-usual, active controls, and waitlists at ≥12 months. 
Insufficient studies precluded testing the efficacy between self-guided i-CBT 
and controls for binary outcomes. For baseline-to-12-month dimensional outcomes, 
guided i-CBT produced greater reductions in anxiety, depressive, post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and repetitive negative thinking (Hedge's g = 
-1.86 to -0.31), and self-guided i-CBT yielded stronger reductions in depressive 
symptoms (g = -0.51) than all controls. For outcome scores aggregated at ≥ 
12-month follow-ups, guided i-CBT alleviated anxiety, depression, distress, 
insomnia, PTSD symptoms, role impairment, emotion regulation, and quality of 
life (g = -0.31 to 0.26), and self-guided i-CBT yielded lower anxiety and 
depressive symptoms (g = -0.16 to -0.09) than all controls. No significant 
differences in efficacy emerged between guided and self-guided i-CBT when 
sufficient studies existed for a meta-analysis. There was no evidence for 
publication bias. Long-term efficacy was similar to short-term efficacy for most 
outcomes. Implementing scalable i-CBTs should entail transparency about their 
long-term benefits and drawbacks.

Co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnoea (COMISA) is a prevalent and debilitating 
condition. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is an effective but 
largely inaccessible treatment in patients with COMISA. We aimed to test a 
self-guided interactive digital CBTi program tailored for COMISA and insomnia 
alone. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted to investigate the 
effect of an interactive tailored digital CBTi program, versus digital sleep 
education (control) on symptoms of insomnia, depression, anxiety, sleepiness, 
fatigue, and maladaptive beliefs about sleep in people with COMISA. Online 
questionnaires were administered at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks. 
Intent-to-treat mixed models and complete-case Fisher's exact analyses were 
used. Participants were 30 adults with COMISA (Age M[sd] = 61.0[10.3], 60% 
female, BMI = 33.5[6.5]). Compared to control, CBTi was associated with lower 
insomnia (M[95% CI] difference = 8.3[5.0-11.6], p < 0.001, d = 2.88), depression 
(3.7[1.0-6.5], p = 0.008, d = 1.66), anxiety (2.9[0.9-4.9], p = 0.005, 
d = 0.62), sleepiness (2.7[0.8-4.5], p = 0.007, d = 0.71), and maladaptive 
beliefs about sleep (13.9[5.7-22.2], p = 0.001, d = 1.16), but not fatigue 
(1.9[-1.2-4.9], p = 0.229, d = 0.68) at 8-week follow-up, controlling for 
baseline scores. The CBTi group experienced greater rates of insomnia remission 
(ISI < 8; 42%, vs. 0%, p = 0.012), and improvement (ISI reduction ≥ 6; 75% vs. 
14%; p = 0.004) by 8-weeks. Improvements in the CBTi group were sustained by 
24-weeks. This tailored digital CBTi program led to large and sustained 
improvements in insomnia, depression, anxiety, sleepiness, and maladaptive 
beliefs about sleep in people with COMISA. Trial Registration: This trial was 
prospectively registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials 
Registry (ANZCTR, ACTRN12622001218785).

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have explored interventions to reduce digital 
addiction outcomes, but inconclusive evidence makes it difficult for 
decision-makers, managers, and clinicians to become familiar with all available 
literature and find appropriate interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize and assess the certainty of evidence of 
interventions proposed to decrease digital addiction from published 
meta-analyses.
METHODS: An umbrella review of published meta-analyses was performed. We 
searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase for meta-analyses 
published up to February 2024. Eligible studies evaluated interventions using 
randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, or 
quasi-experimental studies and were assessed for methodological quality using 
Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews version 2. A random effects model was 
used to analyze data, considering heterogeneity and publication bias. Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations was applied to assess 
evidence with certainty.
RESULTS: A total of 5 studies assessing 21 associations were included in the 
umbrella review, of which 4 (80%) were high-quality meta-analyses. Weak evidence 
was observed in 19 associations, whereas null associations appeared in the 
remaining 2 associations. These associations pertained to 8 interventions (group 
counseling, integrated internet addiction [IA] prevention programs, psychosocial 
interventions, reality therapy, self-control training programs, cognitive 
behavioral therapy, interventions to reduce screen time in children, and 
exercise) and 9 outcomes (self-control, self-esteem, internet gaming disorder 
symptoms, time spent gaming, IA scores, screen use time, interpersonal 
sensitivity longlines, anxiety, and depression). Cognitive behavioral therapy 
reduces anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.939, 95% CI 0.311 to 
1.586), internet gaming disorder symptoms (SMD 1.394, 95% CI 0.664 to 2.214), 
time spent gaming (SMD 1.259, 95% CI, 0.311 to 2.206), and IA scores (SMD 
-2.097, 95% CI -2.814 to -1.381). Group counseling had a large effect on 
improving self-control (SMD 1.296, 95% CI 0.269 to 2.322) and reducing IA levels 
(SMD -1.417, 95% CI -1.836 to -0.997). Exercise intervention reduced IA scores 
(SMD -2.322, 95% CI -3.212 to -1.431), depression scores (SMD -1.421, 95% CI 
-2.046 to -797), and interpersonal sensitivity scores (SMD -1.433, 95% CI -2.239 
to -0.627).
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence indicates that current interventions to reduce digital 
addiction are weak. Data from more and better-designed studies with larger 
sample sizes are needed to establish robust evidence.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal anxiety affects between 20% and 30% of pregnant people and 
is associated with adverse prenatal health conditions, birth outcomes, and 
postpartum mental health challenges. Individuals from racial and ethnic minority 
groups, sexual and gender minority groups, and those with low income are all at 
heightened risk for prenatal anxiety due to disproportionate exposure to adverse 
social determinants of health. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) has 
been shown to reliably reduce anxiety in mostly White and middle- to 
higher-income samples, but its efficacy in low-income and marginalized pregnant 
people is understudied.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a randomized controlled trial of a dCBT (Daylight app, Big 
Health, Ltd) in a sample of low-income pregnant people oversampled for racial, 
ethnic, sexual, and gender minority identity.
METHODS: Participants (N=132) will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist 
control group using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will be a 
self-guided application that uses an online therapist to teach and encourage the 
practice of 4 key cognitive behavioral therapy skills (eg, identifying 
catastrophic thinking and increasing physical relaxation) that can reduce 
anxiety. The primary outcome will be generalized anxiety symptoms; secondary 
outcomes will include depressive symptoms, stress, pregnancy-specific anxiety, 
and insomnia symptoms. Focus groups with a subset of participants will provide 
qualitative data about the acceptability of dCBT.
RESULTS: Recruitment began in June 2024. Data will be analyzed using linear 
mixed models, which will be fit with treatment condition (dCBT and waitlist 
control group) as the between-group factor, time (baseline, 3, 6, and 10 weeks 
post randomization) as a within-group factor, and a group-by-time interaction. 
Linear mixed models produce unbiased parameter estimates in situations where 
there are different numbers of observations per record and will accommodate 
intent-to-treat and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of 
a self-guided dCBT for prenatal anxiety among low-income and marginalized 
pregnant people, a group that continues to experience substantial barriers to 
accessing in-person evidence-based psychotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder among military 
service members, and it compromises readiness, performance, and physical and 
mental health. Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) is the 
standard of care for the treatment of insomnia recommended by the VA/DoD 
Clinical Practice Guideline, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the 
American College of Physicians. CBTI is highly effective but has limited 
scalability. It is often unavailable in clinical settings where service members 
receive sleep care. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to scale and 
broaden the geographic reach of CBTI services and support increased patient 
access and engagement in behavioral sleep care. This study aims to evaluate the 
impact and acceptability of digital CBTI hubs to augment military treatment 
facilities' capabilities in behavioral sleep medicine.
METHODS: This is a multi-site, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial 
designed to compare the effects of in-person (face-to-face or virtual) insomnia 
care as usual at three military sleep clinics versus CBTI delivered remotely and 
asynchronously through digital CBTI hubs. Digital CBTI hubs are led by licensed, 
certified clinicians who use NOCTEM's® evidence-based clinical decision support 
platform COAST™ (Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology). Changes in 
insomnia severity and daytime symptoms of depression and anxiety will be 
compared at baseline, at 6-8 weeks, and at 3-month follow-up. Patient 
satisfaction with insomnia care as usual versus digital CBTI hubs will also be 
examined. We hypothesize that digital CBTI hubs will be non-inferior to insomnia 
care as usual for improvements in insomnia and daytime symptoms as well as 
patient satisfaction with insomnia care.
DISCUSSION: Digital technology has a high potential to scale CBTI accessibility 
and delivery options required to meet the insomnia care needs of military 
service members. Digital CBTI hubs using COAST offer a novel approach to broaden 
service members' access to CBTI and to serve as an augmentation strategy for 
existing sleep services at military treatment facilities. The pragmatic approach 
leveraging technology in this trial has the potential to rapidly inform clinical 
practice within the Defense Health Agency as well as other healthcare systems.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is treatable and preventable, but most 
women do not seek professional help for their perinatal depressive symptoms. One 
increasingly popular approach of improving access to care is the use of 
web-based intervention programs.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was 2-fold: first, to assess the efficacy 
of Be a Mom, a brief web-based selective or indicated preventive intervention, 
in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms of women at high risk for PPD; and 
second, to examine mechanisms of change linking modifiable self-regulatory 
skills (ie, emotion regulation, self-compassion, and psychological flexibility) 
to improved perinatal mental health outcomes.
METHODS: This 2-arm, open-label randomized controlled trial involved a sample of 
1053 perinatal women presenting high risk for PPD who were allocated to the Be a 
Mom intervention group or a waitlist control group and completed self-report 
measures at baseline and postintervention assessments. Univariate latent change 
score models were computed to determine changes over time in adjustment 
processes and outcomes, with a multigroup-model approach to detect differences 
between the intervention and control groups and a 2-wave latent change score 
model to examine whether changes in processes were related to changes in 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Be a Mom was found to be effective in reducing depressive (intervention 
group: µΔ=-3.35; P<.001 vs control group: µΔ=-1.48; P<.001) and anxiety symptoms 
(intervention group: µΔ=-2.24; P<.001 vs control group: µΔ=-0.43; P=.04) in 
comparison with the control group, where such changes were inexistent or much 
smaller. All 3 psychological processes under study improved statistically 
significantly in posttreatment assessments: emotion regulation ability 
(Δχ23=12.3; P=.007) and psychological flexibility (Δχ23=34.9; P<.001) improved 
only in the intervention group, and although self-compassion increased in both 
groups (Δχ23=65.6; P<.001), these improvements were considerably greater in the 
intervention group.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Be a Mom, a low-intensity cognitive 
behavioral therapy program, is a promising first-line intervention for helping 
perinatal women, particularly those with early-onset PPD symptoms.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 80% of new HIV 
diagnoses in 2014 in Europe occurred in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). 
Romania has particularly high HIV incidence, AIDS prevalence, and AIDS-related 
deaths. HIV incidence today in Romania is largely attributed to sexual contact 
among gay and bisexual men (GBM). However, homophobic stigma in Romania keeps 
GBM out of reach of the scant available prevention services and serves as a risk 
factor for HIV. The Comunică intervention delivers motivational interviewing and 
cognitive-behavioral therapy skills across eight live text-based counseling 
sessions. Preliminary evidence suggests that Comunică possesses promise for 
reducing GBM's co-occurring mental (e.g., depression), behavioral (e.g., heavy 
alcohol use), and sexual (e.g., HIV-transmission-risk behavior) health risks in 
Romania and perhaps other similar high-stigma national contexts. This paper 
describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of 
Comunică.
METHODS: To test Comunică's efficacy, 305 GBM were randomized to receive 
Comunică or a content-matched education attention control condition. The control 
condition consists of eight time-matched educational modules that present 
information regarding GBM identity development, information about HIV 
transmission and prevention, the importance of HIV/STI testing and treatment, 
heavy alcohol use and its associations with HIV-transmission-risk behavior, 
sexual health communication, finding social support, and creating sexual health 
goals. Outcomes are measured pre-intervention (baseline), and at 4-, 8-, and 
12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome is frequency of condomless anal sex 
acts with HIV-positive or unknown-status partners outside of the context of 
one's own adherent PrEP use or primary partner's adherent PrEP use or 
undetectable viral load in the past 30 days at each follow-up. Secondary 
outcomes include depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, heavy alcohol use, and 
HIV/STI testing; motivational and stigma-related mechanisms of intervention 
efficacy will also be examined.
DISCUSSION: If found to be efficacious, Comunică presents a scalable platform to 
provide mental, behavioral, and sexual health support to GBM living in Romania 
and similar high-stigma, low-resource areas within the CEE region and beyond.

BACKGROUND: An estimated 1 in 5 adolescents experience a mental health disorder 
each year; yet because of barriers to accessing and seeking care, most remain 
undiagnosed and untreated. Furthermore, the early emergence of psychopathology 
contributes to a lifelong course of challenges across a broad set of functional 
domains, so addressing this early in the life course is essential. With 
increasing digital connectivity, including in low- and middle-income countries, 
digital health technologies are considered promising for addressing mental 
health among adolescents and young people. In recent years, a growing number of 
digital health interventions, including more than 2 million web-based mental 
health apps, have been developed to address a range of mental health issues.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on digital health 
interventions targeting adolescents and young people with mental health 
conditions, aged between 10-24 years, with a focus on effectiveness, 
cost-effectiveness, and generalizability to low-resource settings (eg, low- and 
middle-income countries).
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases between 
January 2010 and June 2020 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital 
mental health interventions targeting adolescents and young people aged between 
10-24 years. Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and 
assessed the quality of the reviews.
RESULTS: In this systematic overview, we included 18 systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses. We found evidence on the effectiveness of computerized cognitive 
behavioral therapy on anxiety and depression, whereas the effectiveness of other 
digital mental health interventions remains inconclusive. Interventions with an 
in-person element with a professional, peer, or parent were associated with 
greater effectiveness, adherence, and lower dropout than fully automatized or 
self-administered interventions. Despite the proposed utility of digital 
interventions for increasing accessibility of treatment across settings, no 
study has reported sample-specific metrics of social context (eg, socioeconomic 
background) or focused on low-resource settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Although digital interventions for mental health can be effective 
for both supplementing and supplanting traditional mental health treatment, only 
a small proportion of existing digital platforms are evidence based. 
Furthermore, their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness, including in low- and 
middle-income countries, have been understudied. Widespread adoption and 
scale-up of digital mental health interventions, especially in settings with 
limited resources for health, will require more rigorous and consistent 
demonstrations of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vis-à-vis the type of 
service provided, target population, and the current standard of care.

The prevalence of mental health disorders among youth and adolescents has been 
rising at an alarming rate over the past few decades, with conditions such as 
anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperreactivity disorder, autism spectrum 
disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder becoming increasingly common. One 
contributing factor that has received growing attention is the role of social 
media and technology in shaping adolescent brain development, behavior, and 
emotional well-being. While digital platforms provide opportunities for social 
connection, self-expression, and mental health support, they also introduce 
significant risks, including compulsive social media use, cyberbullying, 
unrealistic beauty standards, and exposure to substance-related content. This 
article explores the complex relationship between digital media use and 
adolescent mental health, focusing on its neurobiological implications, 
particularly the role of dopaminergic reward pathways in reinforcing compulsive 
behaviors. The excessive engagement with digital platforms has been associated 
with heightened impulsivity, attention deficits, and an increased risk of 
addiction-like behaviors. Furthermore, the impact of social media on self-esteem 
and body image has been linked to higher rates of body dysmorphic disorder and a 
rise in cosmetic procedure considerations, often influenced by digitally altered 
self-perceptions. The increased portrayal of substance-related content online 
also raises concerns about the normalization of risky behaviors among 
impressionable youth. Intervention strategies such as digital detox programs, 
school-based educational initiatives, parental monitoring, and 
cognitive-behavioral therapy are crucial in mitigating the adverse effects of 
excessive social media use. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating policy 
regulation, digital literacy, and targeted mental health interventions, will be 
essential in fostering a healthier digital environment for adolescents. Future 
research should prioritize longitudinal studies to better understand the 
long-term psychological effects of social media use and to distinguish between 
adaptive and maladaptive digital behaviors. By addressing these challenges 
proactively, society can work towards promoting responsible social media 
engagement in youth while protecting adolescent mental health in this digital 
age.

BACKGROUND: Mental health has become an increasingly significant issue in the 
workplace. Non-health care workers are experiencing increased levels of 
psychological symptoms in their workplaces, especially during the COVID-19 
pandemic, which limited social interactions and health service access. These 
conditions have a negative effect on employees' mental health and may also be 
associated with work-related outcomes, such as reduced levels of work 
engagement. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective 
methods used for treating workers with mental illness and preventing 
work-related psychological outcomes. The delivery of internet-based CBT (iCBT) 
has been established as a result of both technological improvements that have 
influenced health promotion and prevention components, and limited social 
contact and health service access.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the best 
available evidence concerning the preventive effect of iCBT on employees.
METHODS: A systematic search will be conducted across 12 electronic 
databases, including a hand search for main journals and reference lists. 
Randomized controlled trials testing the effects of iCBT on psychological 
outcomes and work engagement among employees will be eligible. Initial keywords 
will cover the concepts of employees, workers, non-health care personnel, 
internet-based, web-based, eHealth cognitive behavioral interventions, stress, 
depression, anxiety, and work engagement, and then a full search strategy will 
be developed. Following titles, abstracts and the full text will be screened for 
assessment against the inclusion criteria for the review. Search results will be 
fully reported and presented per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent reviewers will screen and 
extract data, appraise methodological quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 
assessment tool, and assess overall quality of evidence with the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. A random 
effects meta-analysis and standardized mean differences using review manager 
software will be applied to synthesize the effect of iCBT based on similar 
outcomes.
RESULTS: This protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register 
of Systematic Reviews in March 2022 and is now an ongoing process. The data will 
be analyzed in August 2022, and the review process should be completed by 
December 2022. All included studies will be synthesized and presented to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of iCBT in decreasing psychological distress and 
optimizing work engagement outcomes among employees.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings of this study, iCBT therapies will be 
used to promote mental health concerns such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, 
psychological distress, stress, insomnia, and resilience among non-health care 
professionals. In addition, the results will be used to ensure the policy 
related to reducing psychological distress and optimizing work engagement in the 
workplace.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of integrating a self-help training application 
with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating maladaptive perfectionism 
remains unclear. This study evaluated the impact of combining CBT with a 
web-based program versus CBT alone on psychological outcomes in college students 
with maladaptive perfectionism.
METHODS: This study involved 52 participants randomized to a 10-week 
intervention of either CBT or CBT combined with a web-based application. 
Outcomes assessed included perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, 
psychological well-being, procrastination, and life satisfaction, measured 
through self-reporting at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 follow-ups. Data 
analyses utilized independent t tests, chi-square tests for preintervention 
differences, and repeated mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate 
intervention effects over time, with effect sizes calculated using η².
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 27.85 years (SD, 4.94), were 
predominantly female (n = 34; 74%), mostly single (n = 29; 73.9%), and held a 
master's degree (n = 20; 43.5%). Overall, 52 participants were randomized into 2 
groups, with 26 participants in each group. Of these, 23 participants from each 
group completed the treatment and follow-up periods. The CBT combined with an 
App group demonstrated superior effectiveness in addressing perfectionism and 
improving interpersonal sensitivity, striving for excellence, and high standards 
for others compared with CBT alone. In addition, this combined treatment was 
significantly better than CBT in reducing stress, increasing psychological 
well-being, and improving life satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Integrating a web-based self-help application with CBT effectively 
reduces maladaptive perfectionism and associated psychopathology, highlighting 
the potential benefits of combining digital tools with traditional therapeutic 
approaches.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the 
recommended first-line treatment for insomnia. However, scaling this proven 
effective intervention to areas of high need remains a challenge, necessitating 
sensitive adaptation and evaluation.
METHODS: A randomised waitlist-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a 
hybrid digital CBT-I and emotion regulation (dCBT-I + ER) intervention delivered 
through workplaces. Participants with at least mild insomnia and depression or 
anxiety symptoms were randomised to the intervention or waitlist control groups. 
The intervention was delivered via a web-based platform and four 
video-conferencing therapy sessions. Participants tracked their sleep using 
actigraphy and a sleep diary that was used to pace the intervention delivered. 
Assessments occurred at baseline and 8 weeks post-randomisation, measuring 
insomnia, depression, anxiety, psychological well-being, quality of life, and 
work productivity.
RESULTS: Of the 159 participants (mean age 43.6 ± 9.4 years, 76.7% female, 80.5% 
white), 80 received the intervention and 79 were in the control group. The 
intervention group showed significant improvements in insomnia (F1, 134 = 71.46, 
p < .0001); depression (F1, 134 = 35.67, p < .0001); and anxiety (F1, 
134 = 17.63, p < .0001), with large effect sizes (d = 0.7-1.5). Sleep diary data 
supported these findings, whereas actigraphy data did not. Improvements in 
psychological well-being were significant (F1, 132.13 = 10.64, p < 0.001), 
whereas quality of life, work productivity, and satisfaction outcomes were not.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a hybrid dCBT-I + ER intervention, 
delivered via workplaces, effectively improves insomnia, depression, and 
anxiety. It holds promise as a scalable solution, warranting further 
investigation into its long-term efficacy and economic impact.

BACKGROUND: Access to traditional mental health services in Canada remains 
limited, prompting exploration into digital alternatives. The Government of 
Ontario initiated access to two internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
(iCBT) programs, LifeWorks AbilitiCBT and MindBeacon TAiCBT, for adults with 
mental health issues.
METHODS: An uncontrolled observational study utilizing secondary retrospective 
program data was conducted to evaluate the reach, uptake, and psychological 
symptom changes among participants engaging with either iCBT program.
RESULTS: Between May 2020 and September 2021, 56,769 individuals enrolled in 
LifeWorks AbilitiCBT, and 73,356 in MindBeacon TAiCBT. However, substantial 
exclusions were made: 56% of LifeWorks participants and 68% of MindBeacon 
participants were ineligible or failed to initiate treatment. Consequently, 
25,154 LifeWorks participants and 23,795 MindBeacon participants were included 
in the analysis. Of these, 22% of LifeWorks and 26% of MindBeacon participants 
completed over 75% of iCBT treatment. On average, LifeWorks participants 
received 13 ± SD 7.1 therapist messages and sent 5 ± SD 10.3 messages, while 
MindBeacon participants received 25 ± SD 20.7 therapist messages and sent 
13 ± SD 16.4 messages. LifeWorks included synchronous therapist contact 
averaging 1.4 ± SD 1.9 h per participant, while MindBeacon was purely 
asynchronous. Baseline severity of anxiety (37%) and depression symptoms (22%) 
was higher for LifeWorks participants compared to MindBeacon participants (24% 
and 10%, respectively). Clinically significant changes in anxiety and depression 
scores were observed: 22% of LifeWorks and 31% of MindBeacon participants 
exhibited reliable recovery in PHQ-9 scores, while 26% of LifeWorks and 25% of 
MindBeacon participants demonstrated reliable recovery in GAD-7 scores.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, iCBT programs show promise for engaged participants 
with varying levels of severity in anxiety and depression symptoms. Future 
iterations of iCBT should consider adopting a broad entry criterion to iCBT 
programming to increase accessibility, especially for those with severe 
symptoms, alongside integrated intake care pathways, and potential payment 
structure adjustments for iCBT service providers. Taken all together, these 
factors could temper high dropout rates post-intake assessment. This evaluation 
underscores the potential and value of digital mental health interventions for 
individuals with mild to severe anxiety or depression symptoms, emphasizing the 
importance of addressing participant dropout.

OBJECTIVE: To examine a text-messaging program for self-monitoring symptoms of 
bulimia nervosa (BN) within the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
METHOD: Thirty-one women participated in 12 weekly group CBT sessions and a 12 
week follow-up. Participants submitted a text message nightly indicating the 
number of binge eating and purging episodes and rating their urges to binge and 
purge. Automatic feedback messages were tailored to their self-reported 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Fully 87% of participants adhered to self-monitoring and reported good 
acceptability. The number of binge eating and purging episodes as well as 
symptoms of depression (BDI), eating disorder (EDI), and night eating (NES) 
decreased significantly from baseline to both post-treatment and follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Given the frequent use of mobile phones and text-messaging globally, 
this proof-of-principle study suggests their use may enhance self-monitoring and 
treatment for BN leading to improved attendance, adherence, engagement in 
treatment, and remission from the disorder.

OBJECTIVE: Digital substance use treatment programs present an opportunity to 
provide nonresidential care for people with problematic substance use. In June 
2021, the provincial government in Ontario provided free access to Breaking Free 
Online (BFO), a digital behavioral change program for people with substance use 
disorders.
METHODS: An observational study was conducted with retrospective data to 
characterize clients' use and engagement patterns in BFO and examine changes in 
self-reported outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 6,370 individuals registered for BFO between June 2021 and 
October 2022, of whom 3,650 completed the intake assessment. Most of these 
clients were self-referred (64%), with 37% having been referred by health 
service providers. More than one-half of the clients (52%) resided in Ontario 
West or East regions. Support for addressing problematic alcohol use was the 
most requested program (40%). By October 2022, about 44% of the clients had 
completed between one and four of 12 program strategies. Analysis revealed 
significant changes in pre-post scores across four validated scales (p<0.001), 
indicating a decrease in anxiety and depression, an increase in quality of life, 
an improvement in recovery progression, and a decrease in severity of symptoms 
associated with substance use disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: BFO clients with higher completion rates had the most improvement 
across the scales used; however, clients with lower and medium completion rates 
also had improvements. Because of the shame and stigma associated with substance 
use, digital supports with low barriers to entry can help support the autonomy, 
privacy, and preferences of individuals seeking help for problematic substance 
use.

INTRODUCTION: One in six workers experience some form of mental health problems 
at work costing the UK economy an estimated £70 billion/year. Digital 
interventions provide low cost and easily scalable delivery methods to implement 
psychological interventions in the workplace. This trial tests the feasibility 
of implementing a self-guided 8-week digital cognitive behavioural therapy 
intervention for subthreshold to clinical depression and/or anxiety versus 
waitlist control (ie, life as usual) in the workplace.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Feasibility of implementation will be tested using a 
mixed-methods evaluation of the two-arm randomised waitlist-control trial. 
Evaluation will include examination of organisational buy-in, and the engagement 
of employees through the trial indicated by the completion of outcome measures. 
In addition, we also explore how participants use the platform, the 
appropriateness of the analysis both with reference to the outcome measures and 
linear modelling. Finally, we examine the acceptability of the intervention 
based on participants experiences using qualitative interviews. Assessments take 
place at baseline (T0), at 8 weeks post-treatment (T1), at short-term follow-up 
4 weeks post-treatment (T2) and long-term follow-ups (6 and 12 months after-end 
of treatment). We will recruit from 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 for 
employees and self-employed workers with depression and anxiety symptoms 
(subclinical and clinical levels) who are not seeking or engaged in treatment at 
the time of the trial.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full approval was given by the University of Warwick 
Biomedical and Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 45/20-21). The current protocol 
version is 2.8 (August 2021). Publication of results in peer-reviewed journals 
will inform the scientific, clinical and business communities. We will 
disseminate results through webinars, conferences, newsletter as well as a lay 
summary of results on the study website (mhpp.me).

BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are common in alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment 
patients. Such co-occurring conditions ("comorbidity") have negative prognostic 
implications for AUD treatment outcomes, yet they commonly go unaddressed in 
standard AUD care. Over a decade ago, we developed and validated a cognitive 
behavioral therapy intervention to supplement standard AUD care that, when 
delivered by trained therapists, improves outcomes in comorbid patients. 
However, this validated intervention, like many others in addiction care, has 
not been taken up in community-based AUD treatment programs. This 
phenomenon-empirically validated treatments that fail to be widely adopted in 
community care-has been termed the "research-to-practice gap." Researchers have 
suggested that the availability of fully autonomous digital equivalents of 
validated therapist-delivered therapies could reduce some barriers underlying 
the research-to-practice gap, especially by eliminating the need for costly and 
intensive therapist training and supervision.
OBJECTIVE: With this in mind, we obtained a Program Development Grant (R34) to 
conduct formative work in the development of a fully autonomous digital version 
of our previously validated therapist-delivered intervention for AUD treatment 
patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder.
METHODS: In the first phase of the project, we developed the digital 
intervention. This process included: (1) identifying appropriate collaborators 
and vendors; (2) consultation with an e-learning expert to develop a storyboard 
and accompanying graphics and narrative; (3) video production and editing; and 
(4) interactive programming. The second phase of the project was functional 
testing of the newly developed digital intervention conducted in 52 residential 
AUD treatment patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder. Patients underwent the 
3 one-hour segments of the newly developed intervention and completed user 
surveys, knowledge quizzes, and behavioral competence tests.
RESULTS: While the development of the digital intervention was successful, the 
timeline was approximately double that projected (1 vs 2 years) due to false 
starts and inefficiencies that we describe, including lessons learned. 
Functional testing of the newly developed digital intervention showed that, on 
average, patients rated the user experience in the upper (favorable) 20% of the 
response scales. Knowledge quizzes and behavioral demonstrations showed that 
over 80% of participants gained functional mastery of the key skills and 
information taught in the program.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional testing results in this study justify a randomized 
controlled trial of the digital intervention's efficacy, which is currently 
ongoing. In sharing the details of our challenges and solutions in developing 
the digital intervention, we hope to inform others developing digital tools. The 
extent to which the availability of empirically validated, fully autonomous 
digital interventions achieves their potential to reduce the 
research-to-practice gap remains an open but important empirical question. The 
present work stands as a necessary first step toward that end.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of interventions for the management of 
long covid (post-covid condition).
DESIGN: Living systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary 
Medicine Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 
inception to December 2023.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Trials that randomised adults (≥18 years) with long covid 
to drug or non-drug interventions, placebo or sham, or usual care.
RESULTS: 24 trials with 3695 patients were eligible. Four trials (n=708 
patients) investigated drug interventions, eight (n=985) physical activity or 
rehabilitation, three (n=314) behavioural, four (n=794) dietary, four (n=309) 
medical devices and technologies, and one (n=585) a combination of physical 
exercise and mental health rehabilitation. Moderate certainty evidence suggested 
that, compared with usual care, an online programme of cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) probably reduces fatigue (mean difference -8.4, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) -13.11 to -3.69; Checklist for Individual Strength fatigue 
subscale; range 8-56, higher scores indicate greater impairment) and probably 
improves concentration (mean difference -5.2, -7.97 to -2.43; Checklist for 
Individual Strength concentration problems subscale; range 4-28; higher scores 
indicate greater impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, 
compared with usual care, an online, supervised, combined physical and mental 
health rehabilitation programme probably leads to improvement in overall health, 
with an estimated 161 more patients per 1000 (95% CI 61 more to 292 more) 
experiencing meaningful improvement or recovery, probably reduces symptoms of 
depression (mean difference -1.50, -2.41 to -0.59; Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale depression subscale; range 0-21; higher scores indicate greater 
impairment), and probably improves quality of life (0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08; 
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29+2 Profile; range 
-0.022-1; higher scores indicate less impairment). Moderate certainty evidence 
suggested that intermittent aerobic exercise 3-5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks 
probably improves physical function compared with continuous exercise (mean 
difference 3.8, 1.12 to 6.48; SF-36 physical component summary score; range 
0-100; higher scores indicate less impairment). No compelling evidence was found 
to support the effectiveness of other interventions, including, among others, 
vortioxetine, leronlimab, combined probiotics-prebiotics, coenzyme Q10, amygdala 
and insula retraining, combined L-arginine and vitamin C, inspiratory muscle 
training, transcranial direct current stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen, a mobile 
application providing education on long covid.
CONCLUSION: Moderate certainty evidence suggests that CBT and physical and 
mental health rehabilitation probably improve symptoms of long covid.

Contemporary developments, such as digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) 
and wearable devices estimating sleep, could support the implementation of CBT 
for insomnia at a large scale. We assessed what characterizes those users who 
connected a wearable device to the program to estimate sleep diary variables, 
and whether connecting a wearable device affected insomnia symptom improvement, 
related well-being, and program interaction. In total, 3551 users (63% female, 
mean age 44.50 ± 14.78 years) of a dCBT program who completed a post-therapy 
survey, including 378 users (10.6%) who used a device, were selected. 
Within-subject, pre-therapy to post-therapy, the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI, 
7 Items) was used to assess insomnia. Two-item measures (depression, anxiety) 
and single item measures (perceived stress, life satisfaction, work 
productivity) of well-being were analyzed, in addition to program interaction. 
For all participants, insomnia symptoms significantly improved following dCBT 
(t(3504) = 83.33, p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.45), as did depression and anxiety 
symptoms, perceived stress, life satisfaction and work productivity. Those who 
did not connect a device reported better sleep and less affected work 
productivity (all p < .001) than those who did connect a device at baseline and 
post-treatment; nevertheless treatment effects were largely similar for the two 
groups. Those who connected a device interacted more with additional program 
components. In conclusion, improvements in insomnia after completing dCBT are 
similar in persons choosing to wear a wearable device to estimate sleep and 
persons completing a subjective sleep diary. Potentially, use of wearable 
devices can facilitate treatment for those who struggle to complete daily 
diaries.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is associated with elevated levels of suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors. Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (CBTI) may reduce suicidal ideation (SI). However, the role 
of digital therapeutics in both the alleviation and prevention of SI remains 
unclear, and treatment mechanisms facilitating SI reductions have not been 
clearly identified.
METHODS: A total of 658 adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 5th Edition insomnia disorder enrolled in a single-site randomized 
controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of digital CBTI relative to attention 
control. Outcomes were measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1-year 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Before treatment, 126 patients endorsed SI (19.1% prevalence). Among 
those with baseline SI, CBTI patients reported lower SI rates at posttreatment 
(30.0% vs 54.5%, p = .005) and 1-year follow-up (29.6% vs 46.8%, p = .042) 
relative to control. PRODCLIN analysis estimated that half of suicidolytic 
effects of CBTI were mediated through insomnia remission. Among those without 
baseline SI, CBTI did not directly prevent new onset SI. However, insomnia 
remitters reported lower rates of new-onset SI at posttreatment relative to 
non-remitters (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = .009). Mediation analysis supported a 
significant indirect effect wherein CBTI increased the likelihood of insomnia 
remission, which was associated with SI prevention (αβ = -3.20, 95% CI = -5.74 
to -0.87).
CONCLUSION: Digital CBTI reduces insomnia symptoms, which promotes SI 
alleviation and prevention. For nonsuicidal patients, digital CBTI may serve as 
a highly accessible monotherapy for improving sleep, thereby reducing the risk 
for SI. For suicidal patients, digital CBTI may be appropriately administered as 
an adjunct treatment to support mainline intervention more directly targeting 
suicidogenic thoughts.

BACKGROUND: Emotion dysregulation is key to the development and maintenance of 
chronic pain, feeding into a cycle of worsening pain and disability. Dialectical 
behavioral therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment for complex 
transdiagnostic conditions presenting with high emotion dysregulation, may be 
beneficial to manage and mitigate the emotional and sensory aspects of chronic 
pain. Increasingly, DBT skills training as a key component of standard DBT is 
being delivered as a stand-alone intervention without concurrent therapy to help 
develop skills for effective emotion regulation. A previous repeated-measure 
single-case trial investigating a novel technologically driven DBT skills 
training, internet-delivered DBT skills training for chronic pain (iDBT-Pain), 
revealed promising findings to improve both emotion dysregulation and pain 
intensity.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of 
iDBT-Pain in comparison with treatment as usual to reduce emotion dysregulation 
(primary outcome) for individuals with chronic pain after 9 weeks and at the 
21-week follow-up. The secondary outcomes include pain intensity, pain 
interference, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, 
posttraumatic stress, harm avoidance, social cognition, sleep quality, life 
satisfaction, and well-being. The trial also examines the acceptability of the 
iDBT-Pain intervention for future development and testing.
METHODS: A total of 48 people with chronic pain will be randomly assigned to 1 
of 2 conditions: treatment and treatment as usual. Participants in the treatment 
condition will receive iDBT-Pain, consisting of 6 live web-based group sessions 
led by a DBT skills trainer and supervised by a registered psychologist and the 
iDBT-Pain app. Participants in the treatment-as-usual condition will not receive 
iDBT-Pain but will still access their usual medication and health interventions. 
We predict that iDBT-Pain will improve the primary outcome of emotion 
dysregulation and the secondary outcomes of pain intensity, pain interference, 
anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, harm avoidance, social 
cognition, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and well-being. A linear mixed 
model with random effects of individuals will be conducted to investigate the 
differences between the baseline, 9-week (primary end point), and 21-week 
(follow-up) assessments as a function of experimental condition.
RESULTS: Recruitment started in February 2023, and the clinical trial started in 
March 2023. Data collection for the final assessment is planned to be completed 
by July 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: If our hypothesis is confirmed, our findings will contribute to the 
evidence for the efficacy and acceptability of a viable intervention that may be 
used by health care professionals for people with chronic pain. The results will 
add to the chronic pain literature to inform about the potential benefits of DBT 
skills training for chronic pain and will contribute evidence about 
technologically driven interventions.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers (HCP) face various stressful conditions in 
hospitals that result in the development of anxiety disorders. However, due to 
heavy workloads, they often miss the opportunity for self-care. Any effort to 
diminish this problem improves the quality of Healthcare providers and enhances 
patient safety. various applications have been developed to empower Healthcare 
providers and reduce their anxiety, but these applications do not meet all their 
individual and professional needs. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the impact of mobile-based self-care applications on reducing 
anxiety in healthcare providers.
METHODS: In this study, keywords such as anxiety, self-care, healthcare 
providers, and mobile health were used to search PubMed, Scopus, and Web of 
Science for papers published in the recent ten years (2014-2024). We used the 
PRISMA diagram to report the results. Ten out of 2515 retrieved articles that 
addressed the effect of mobile-based self-care applications on Healthcare 
providers' anxiety were included for analysis. Data were extracted using a data 
collection form designed based on the research objective. We used this form to 
collect data including the author's name, publication year, country, study type, 
intervention duration, study objectives, platform used, Modules presented in 
technologies, Methods of reducing anxiety, questionnaire details, and 
Effectiveness assessment. Data collected from the studies were analyzed by 
SPSS-21 using frequency and percentage.
RESULTS: Based on the results, studies were conducted in nine different 
countries, and the intervention duration and strategies for reducing anxiety 
using self-care applications ranged from two weeks to four months. The impact of 
mobile health applications, their content, and intervention strategies on 
reducing anxiety were positive. The anxiety-reduction strategies were varied 
among applications. Anxiety reduction strategies in this study included 
mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical activities, breathing 
exercises, dietary regimes, and nature exploration through virtual reality. 
Cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness constituted the most frequently 
applied reduction techniques across the studies to reduce anxiety in Healthcare 
providers.Furthermore, the findings revealed the effectiveness of interventions 
in reducing other mental disorders such as anxiety, stress, depression, drug 
abuse, and psychotropic drug use of Healthcare providers.
CONCLUSION: The use of mobile health applications with practical strategies is 
effective in reducing anxiety and can also reduce other anxiety disorders in 
Healthcare professional.

Introduction: Developing a good therapeutic alliance is considered essential for 
the responsible delivery of psychotherapy. Text-based digital psychotherapy has 
become increasingly common, yet much remains unclear about the alliance and its 
importance for delivering mental health care via a digital format. To employ 
text-based digital therapies responsibly, more insight is needed into the type 
and strength of the therapeutic alliance online. Methods: A systematic scoping 
review was performed searching four databases: Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, 
and Wiley Online Library. A total of 23 studies were selected and data was 
extracted and tabulated to explore the characteristics of studies on text-based 
psychotherapy, measurements of the therapeutic alliance and associations of the 
alliance with treatment outcome. Results: The therapeutic alliance in text-based 
digital interventions was studied with a variety of client groups, though mostly 
for clients diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression issues. Treatment 
modalities were predominantly internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) 
and tailored platforms for distinct client groups (e.g., PTSD). Almost all 
treatments used asynchronous text-based communication, such as e-mails and 
integrated messaging functions, which were mainly used to give feedback on 
tasks. For measurements, a version of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) was 
used in most studies. Measurements with the WAI or WAI- short form indicated a 
good therapeutic alliance with a weighted mean score of 5.66 (on a scale of 1 to 
7) and a weighted standard deviation of 0.84. Relations between the therapeutic 
alliance and treatment outcomes were mostly positive, with many studies 
reporting significant associations (n = 8 out of 10) or significant effects of 
the therapeutic alliance on treatment outcomes (n = 5 out of 6). Discussion: Our 
scoping review suggests that a good therapeutic alliance can be established in 
digital psychotherapy through text-based communication, and shows support for a 
positive relationship between the alliance and treatment outcomes. These 
findings illustrate that text-based online psychotherapy can be a responsible 
treatment option as far as the establishment of the therapeutic alliance is 
concerned. However, current measures of the therapeutic alliance might miss 
important aspects of the alliance in digital treatment, such as the presence of 
empathy or compassion.

Digital cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic insomnia (D-CBT-I) has been 
shown to be as efficacious as traditional CBT-I. However, not all patients 
achieve insomnia remission after treatment. We explored the factors influencing 
the effectiveness of D-CBT-I in a clinical practice. A total of 414 Asian 
chronic insomniacs were studied during a 6 week D-CBT-I intervention. All 
patients were assessed at baseline and posttreatment and were determined to be 
remitters or non-remitters, responders or non-responders by posttreatment 
criteria; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI <8) or ISI reduction ≥8, to examine 
whether remission and response status were associated with patient baseline 
characteristics. The average baseline ISI score in all subjects was 16.29 
points. At posttreatment, 192 (46.4%) patients achieved ISI remission and 218 
(52.7%) patients demonstrated an ISI response. An increased baseline early 
morning awakening time and ISI score were independently associated with a lower 
odds for remission (OR, 0.995 and 0.991, respectively). Increased baseline 
Patients Health Questionnaire-9 score was independently associated with higher 
odds for response (OR, 1.114). Our results suggest that D-CBT-I can be 
recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, particularly in 
insomniacs with milder insomnia symptoms and more severe depressive symptoms. 
Meanwhile, the effectiveness of D-CBT-I was adversely affected by longer early 
morning awakening time and higher insomnia severity at pretreatment, which may 
be improved by more intense intervention and greater therapeutic support or by 
traditional CBT-I.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the efficacy of cognitive 
behavioural therapy for improving mood in perinatal depression.
BACKGROUND: The impact of cognitive behavioural therapy on perinatal depression 
has been evaluated in various studies, but there is uncertainty about their 
impact.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Nine electronic literature databases were searched to retrieve eligible 
randomised controlled trials: CNKI, VIP digital database, Chinese Wanfang 
database, the Cochrane library, PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL 
from the inception of the databases up to 15 November 2019. The eligible studies 
were screened and extracted, and then, the methodological quality was evaluated 
independently by two researchers. The meta-analyst software (Rev Man 5.3) was 
used to conduct the meta-analysis. Checklist of Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses has been followed.
RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs with 966 participants were included. The results showed 
that the CBT group was superior to the usual care group in reducing depression 
symptoms of pregnant women after treatment immediately, and the difference was 
statistically significant. Similarly, at postpartum (<4 months), the results 
showed that the CBT group was superior to the usual care group in improving 
depression symptoms of pregnant women. However, there was no statistical 
difference at postpartum (>4 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural therapy can effectively relieve the symptoms 
of depression at short-term effect. However, its long-term effect need to be 
verified by further clinical studies.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This meta-analysis suggested that cognitive 
behavioural therapy should be considered as a complementary programme for 
patients with perinatal depression. Medical workers could apply cognitive 
behavioural therapy into daily routine cares for perinatal depression.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with a chronic medical condition 
show an increased risk for developing mental comorbidities compared to their 
healthy peers. Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) 
might be a low-threshold treatment to support affected AYA. In this randomized 
controlled pilot trial, the feasibility and potential efficacy of youthCOACHCD, 
an iCBT targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in AYA with chronic medical 
conditions, was evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 30 AYA (Mage 16.13; SD= 2.34; 73% female), aged 12-21 years 
either suffering from cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis or type 1 
diabetes, were randomly assigned to either a guided version of the iCBT 
youthCOACHCD (IG, n=15) or to a waitlist control group (CG, n=15), receiving an 
unguided version of the iCBT six months post-randomization. Participants of the 
IG and the CG were assessed before (t0), twelve weeks after (t1) and six months 
after (t2) randomization. Primary outcome was the feasibility of the iCBT. 
Different parameters of feasibility e.g. acceptance, client satisfaction or 
potential side effects were evaluated. First indications of the possible 
efficacy with regard to the primary efficacy outcome, the Patient Health 
Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale, and further outcome variables were 
evaluated using linear regression models, adjusting for baseline values.
RESULTS: Regarding feasibility, intervention completion was 60%; intervention 
satisfaction (M = 25.42, SD = 5.85) and perceived therapeutic alliance (M = 
2.83, SD = 1.25) were moderate and comparable to other iCBTs. No patterns 
emerged regarding subjective and objective negative side effects due to 
participation in youthCOACHCD. Estimates of potential efficacy showed between 
group differences, with a potential medium-term benefit of youthCOACHCD (β = 
-0.55, 95%CI: -1.17; 0.07), but probably not short-term (β = 0.20, 95%CI: -0.47; 
0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to the feasibility of youthCOACHCD and the 
implementation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial addressing its 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Due to the small sample size, conclusions 
are premature, however, further strategies to foster treatment adherence should 
be considered.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the WHO International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Trials Register (ID: 
DRKS00016714 , 25/03/2019).

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for 
depression. Self-directed online CBT interventions have made CBT more accessible 
at a lower cost. However, adherence is often poor and, in the absence of 
therapist support, effects are modest and short-term. Delivering CBT online 
using instant messaging is clinically and cost-effective; however, most existing 
platforms are limited to instant messaging sessions, without the support of 
between-session "homework" activities. The INTERACT intervention integrates 
online CBT materials and 'high-intensity' therapist-led CBT, delivered remotely 
in real-time. The INTERACT trial will evaluate this novel integration in terms 
of clinical and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to therapists and clients.
METHODS: Pragmatic, two parallel-group multi-centre individually randomised 
controlled trial, with 434 patients recruited from primary care practices in 
Bristol, London and York. Participants with depression will be identified via 
General Practitioner record searches and direct referrals.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: aged ≥ 18 years; score ≥ 14 on Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI-II); meeting International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for 
depression.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: alcohol or substance dependency in the past year; bipolar 
disorder; schizophrenia; psychosis; dementia; currently under psychiatric care 
for depression (including those referred but not yet seen); cannot complete 
questionnaires unaided or requires an interpreter; currently receiving CBT/other 
psychotherapy; received high-intensity CBT in the past four years; participating 
in another intervention trial; unwilling/unable to receive CBT via 
computer/laptop/smartphone. Eligible participants will be randomised to 
integrated CBT or usual care. Integrated CBT utilises the standard Beckian 
intervention for depression and comprises nine live therapist-led sessions, with 
(up to) a further three if clinically appropriate. The first session is 
60-90 min via videocall, with subsequent 50-min sessions delivered online, using 
instant messaging. Participants allocated integrated CBT can access integrated 
online CBT resources (worksheets/information sheets/videos) within and between 
sessions. Outcome assessments at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month post-randomisation. The 
primary outcome is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score at 6 months (as 
a continuous variable). A nested qualitative study and health economic 
evaluation will be conducted.
DISCUSSION: If clinically and cost-effective, this model of integrated CBT could 
be introduced into existing psychological services, increasing access to, and 
equity of, CBT provision.

Psychosocial interventions for serious mental illness are resource intensive and 
poorly accessible. Brief interventions (eg, single session) that are augmented 
by follow-on automated mobile health intervention may expand treatment access. 
This was a randomized single-blind controlled trial with 255 individuals 
diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomized 
to one of three conditions: CBT2go, which combined one individual session of 
cognitive behavioral therapy with automated thought challenging/adaptive 
behavior delivered through mobile devices; Self-Monitoring (SM), which combined 
single-session illness psychoeducation with self-monitoring of symptoms; and 
treatment-as-usual (TAU). Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks 
(midpoint), 12 weeks (posttreatment), and 24 weeks (follow-up) with our primary 
outcome global psychopathology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-expanded version 
[BPRS-24]), and secondary outcomes community functioning (Specific Level of 
Function; SLOF) and defeatist performance beliefs (DPBs). We also collected data 
on adverse events. Outcome analyses on the primary outcome, BPRS Total score, 
indicated a significant time (0-24 wk) by group interaction with significant but 
modest improvement comparing two active conditions (CBT2go and SM) relative to 
TAU. Effects of CBT2go were not different from SM. There was a significant time 
× group interaction with better SLOF scores in CBT2go across 24 weeks, but not 
in SM. There were no time-by-group effects on DPBs. DPBs decreased in the CBT2go 
condition but not in SM. These results indicated that single intervention 
augmented by mobile intervention was feasible and associated with small yet 
sustained effects on global psychopathology and, when inclusive of CBT, 
community function compared with usual care.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of blended 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to standard CBT for adult patients 
suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD).
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis alongside the randomized controlled ENTER trial.
SETTING: Center for Telepsychiatry, Mental Health Services in the Region of 
Southern Denmark, Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: The study included 76 patients suffering from MDD.
INTERVENTIONS: The patients in the intervention group received blended CBT 
treatment comprising a combination of online modules and face-to-face 
consultations with a psychologist. The patients in the control group received 
standard CBT treatment, that is, solely face-to-face consultations with a 
psychologist. The treatment period was 12 weeks.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was reported as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. A micro-costing approach was applied to evaluate the 
savings derived. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated 
using the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels questionnaire at the baseline and the 
six-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Data for 74 patients were included in the primary analysis. The 
adjusted QALY difference between blended CBT and standard CBT was -0.0291 (95% 
CI: -0.0535 to -0.0047), and the adjusted difference in costs was -£226.32 (95% 
CI: -300.86 to -151.77). Blended CBT was estimated to have a 6.6% and 3.1% 
probability of being cost-effective based on thresholds of £20,000 and £30,000.
CONCLUSION: Compared to standard CBT, blended CBT represents a cost-saving but 
also a loss in QALYs for patients suffering from MDD. However, results should be 
carefully interpreted, given the small sample size. Future research involving 
larger replication studies focusing on other aspects of blended CBT with more 
patient involvement is advised.

BACKGROUND: There is compelling evidence that psychological factors may have the 
same or even greater impact on the possibility of adverse events on cardiac 
diseases (CD) than other traditional clinical risk factors. Anxiety and 
depression are predictors of short- and long-term adverse outcomes, increased 
risk for higher rates of in-hospital complications, re-infarction, malignant 
arrhythmias, and mortality in CD patients. Despite researchers finding that 
cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, the 
fact that such results are maintained only in the short term and the lack of 
maintenance of the long-term affects the absence of changes in lifestyles, 
preventing the possibility of a wide generalization of results. Recently 
wellbeing therapy (WBT) has been proposed as a useful approach to improve 
healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce psychological distress.
METHODS/DESIGN: The present randomized controlled study will test WBT, in 
comparison with CBT, as far as the reduction of symptoms of depression, anxiety 
and psychological distress, and the improvement of lifestyle behaviors and 
quality of life in cardiac patients are concerned. Moreover, innovations in 
communication technologies allow patients to be constantly followed in real 
life. Therefore WBT based on personalized mobile technology will allow the 
testing of its effectiveness in comparison with usual WBT.
DISCUSSION: The present study is a large outpatient study on the treatment of 
co-morbid depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in cardiac patients. 
The most important issues of this study are its randomized design, the focus on 
promotion of health-related behaviors, and the use of innovative technologies 
supporting patients' wellbeing in real life and in a continuous way. First 
results are expected in 2012.

OBJECTIVES: Digital health technology (DHT)-based psychological interventions 
are emerging as a means to enhance psychological outcomes for cancer survivors. 
This study aims to assess the effects of DHT-based psychological interventions 
on anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life among 
cancer survivors.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, the 
Cochrane Library, and Embase. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool RoB 2 was used to 
evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Template for Intervention 
Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to check if the 
interventions reviewed were described in detail to be implemented in the 
clinical setting. Data synthesis was conducted in Review Manager (Version 5.4), 
and the effect size was calculated by the standardized mean difference and its 
95% confidence interval. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also 
conducted. The certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis encompassed 46 randomized controlled trials, 
involving 5211 participants. DHT-based psychological interventions significantly 
reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.59/-0.24), depression (SMD = -0.26, 95% 
CI -0.39/-0.13), sleep disturbance (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI -0.64/-0.14), fatigue 
(SMD = -0.47, 95% CI -0.77/-0.17), and improved quality of life (SMD = 0.42, 95% 
CI 0.22/0.62). Subgroup analysis indicated that interventions lasting for a 
duration of ≥ 12 weeks, and integrated interventions might be the most effective 
in addressing adverse psychological outcomes. And cognitive-behavioral therapy 
interventions demonstrated significant effectiveness in managing sleep 
disturbance.
CONCLUSION: DHT-based psychological interventions might be effective for 
improving anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life 
in cancer survivors. We cannot draw definitive conclusions due to intervention 
and study design heterogeneity. Further rigorous trials are crucial to identify 
optimal interventions for different types of cancers, determine suitable 
durations, specify types of DHT-based psychological interventions and validate 
intervention therapies.

783. Psychological interventions for the treatment of depression: Depression in 
children and young people, 2019 evidence review: Evidence review A.

London: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); 2019 Jun.
NICE Evidence Reviews Collection.

Depression in children and young people can have a devastating impact on their 
development, ability to function and attendance at school. The 2015 NICE 
guidance (NICE guideline CG28) on depression in children and young people 
recommends psychological interventions for people with mild or moderate to 
severe depression before pharmacological interventions are considered. 
Psychological interventions can be delivered as group interventions (e.g. group 
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, CBT), using computers or other digital devices 
(e.g. computer CBT), as individual sessions (e.g. CBT) or as sessions involving 
family in addition to the child or young person with depression, either in joint 
sessions (e.g. family therapy) or in parallel (interpersonal psychotherapy, IPT, 
which includes some parent sessions, psychodynamic psychotherapy). The choice of 
therapy is based on the individual needs of the child or young person with 
depression, taking into account their history and presentation and the context 
in which treatment is to be provided. The NICE guideline on depression in 
children and young people (NICE guideline CG28) was reviewed in 2017 as part of 
NICE’s routine surveillance programme to determine whether new evidence was 
available that could alter the current recommendations. The surveillance report 
identified new evidence relating to psychological therapies for the treatment of 
depression in children and young people. In particular, results from the 
National Institute for Health Research funded IMPACT trial (Goodyer 2017) 
suggested that a brief psychosocial intervention was as clinically effective as 
short-term psychoanalytical therapy and CBT, while a cost-effectiveness analysis 
showed no difference in cost between the interventions. As a result, the 
decision was made to update this part of the guideline. The aim of this review 
is to compare psychological interventions to determine the most effective 
treatments for depression in children and young people. This review identified 
studies that fulfilled the conditions specified in Table 1. For full details of 
the review protocol, see appendix A.

Mental health conditions during pregnancy, especially postpartum depression 
(PPD), can have profound and long-lasting effects on the individual, impeding 
her ability to bond with her child and disrupting the family dynamics. Although 
pharmacological treatments like antidepressants are the mainstay treatment 
options, several mothers have concerns about their safety and potential side 
effects, especially breastfeeding mothers. There is an emerging interest in 
exploring the use of non-pharmacological interventions as an alternative 
treatment modality for PPD. This review focuses on the effectiveness of 
non-pharmacological options like cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal 
therapy, the use of mobile games, technological interventions, and creative art 
techniques. This review also highlights the existing gaps like the dearth of 
research from lower socioeconomic countries where postpartum women face several 
barriers in accessing the much-needed support as stigma surrounding mental 
health still exists and the lack of studies to assess the long-term effects of 
these interventions.

Guided digital mental health interventions are more effective than unguided 
interventions. While research often emphasizes the frequency and intensity of 
guidance, less attention has been paid to the behaviors enacted by the 
therapists supporting clients using these interventions. A scoping review of the 
literature was conducted to systematically examine the evidence on therapist 
behaviors (i.e., the actions and feedback provided by supporters to patients). 
Applying broad eligibility criteria, a systematic search was conducted in 
PubMed, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library, and Embase from their inception to 
January 1st 2024. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria and were included in 
the review. Following data extraction, a descriptive analysis and synthesis of 
the results was performed. Most studies (n = 12; 75 %) focused on therapist 
behaviors in the context of internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
anxiety and depression. While earlier studies primarily focused on identifying 
therapist behaviors, later studies shifted towards examining the associations 
between therapist behaviors and different outcomes, as well as deriving research 
and clinical applications for improving guided internet-delivered treatments. 
Identified gaps and recommendations for clinical practice, research, training, 
and treatment development are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Self-harm and depression are strong risk factors for repeat 
self-harm and suicide. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of a randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) of remotely delivered problem-solving cognitive behaviour 
therapy (PSCBT) plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU in young people with 
repeat self-harm and depression.
METHODS: Single-blind multi-centre RCT with an internal pilot, pre-set stop-go 
criteria and qualitative semi-structured interviews. Eligible participants (aged 
16-30 years) were recruited from 9 adult or child and adolescent self-harm and 
crisis services; had ≥ 2 lifetime self-harm episodes, one in the preceding 96 h; 
and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score ≥ 17. Participants were 
randomised (1:1) to either TAU or TAU and 10-12 sessions of PSCBT delivered by 
mobile phone or video-calling.
RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were recruited (11 in each arm), 10 (46%) 
completed follow-up at 6 months, 9 (82%) started the PSCBT and 4 (36%) completed 
it. The study did not meet three of its four stop-go criteria, reflecting 
considerable barriers to recruitment and retention. Participants had severe 
depression symptoms: with mean BDI-II 38.9 in the PSCBT and 37.2 in TAU groups, 
respectively. Three (14%) unblindings occurred for immediate safety concerns. 
Barriers to recruitment and retention included lack of agency for participants, 
severity of depression, recency of crisis with burden for participants and 
clinicians who diagnosed depression according to pervasiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of PSCBT for young people with depression and self-harm are 
not feasible using recruitment through mental health services that conduct 
assessments following self-harm presentations. Clinician assessment following 
self-harm presentation mainly identifies those with severe rather than 
mild-moderate depression.

BACKGROUND: Existing treatments for depression are known to have only modest 
effects, are insufficiently targeted, and are inconsistently utilized, 
particularly in older adults. Indeed, older adults with impaired cognitive 
control networks tend to demonstrate poor response to a majority of existing 
depression interventions. Cognitive control interventions delivered using 
entertainment software have the potential to not only target the underlying 
cerebral dysfunction associated with depression, but to do so in a manner that 
is engaging and engenders adherence to treatment protocol.
METHODS: In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02229188), 
individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were randomized 
to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically inspired 
digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project: EVO™, 
n = 12). Given the overlapping functional neuroanatomy of mood disturbances and 
executive dysfunction, we explored the impact of an intervention targeting 
cognitive control abilities, functional disability, and mood in older adults 
suffering from LLD, and how those outcomes compare to a therapeutic gold 
standard.
RESULTS: EVO participants demonstrated similar improvements in mood and 
self-reported function after 4 weeks of treatment to PST participants. The EVO 
participants also showed generalization to untrained measures of working memory 
and attention, as well as negativity bias, a finding not evident in the PST 
condition. Individuals assigned to EVO demonstrated 100% adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary findings that this therapeutic 
video game targeting cognitive control deficits may be an efficacious LLD 
intervention. Future research is needed to confirm these findings.

OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the engagement, clinical outcomes, and adverse 
events of text or voice message-based psychotherapy (MBP) versus 
videoconferencing-based psychotherapy (VCP) among adults with depression.
METHODS: The study used a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial design 
with data drawn from phase 1 of a two-phase small business innovation research 
study. In total, 215 adults (ages ≥18 years) with depression received care from 
Talkspace, a digital mental health care company. Participants were initially 
randomly assigned to receive either asynchronous MBP or weekly VCP. All 
therapists provided evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral 
therapy. After 6 weeks of treatment, participants whose condition did not show a 
response on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or was rated as having not 
improved on the Clinical Global Impressions scale were randomly reassigned to 
receive either weekly VCP plus MBP or monthly VCP plus MBP. Longitudinal 
mixed-effects models with piecewise linear time trends applied to multiple 
imputed data sets were used to address missingness of data.
RESULTS: Participants who were initially assigned to the MBP condition engaged 
with their therapists over more weeks than did participants in the VCP condition 
(7.8 weeks for MBP vs. 4.9 weeks for VCP; p<0.001). No meaningful differences 
were observed between the two groups in rates of change by 6 or 12 weeks for 
depression, anxiety, disability, or global ratings of improvement. Neither 
treatment resulted in any adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: MBP appears to be a viable alternative to VCP for treating adults 
with depression.

OBJECTIVES: First-year college students had exposure to unhealthy lifestyle 
behaviors that correlate with a high prevalence of anxiety and depression. 
Regarding to the modifiable lifestyle behaviors factors, this study investigated 
the prevalence and correlation of multiple lifestyle behaviors, anxiety and 
depression in a sample of Chinese first-year college students.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were extracted from Residents eHealth app of 
health lifestyle behaviors survey from September to October 2019. Anxiety, 
depression, eating regular meals, consumption of snacks in-between meals, 
consumption of fruit, dessert and sugar-sweetened beverages, smoking and 
secondhand smoke exposure, consuming alcohol, physical activity, sedentary time 
were assessed by self-report. Socio-demographic including age, gender, 
education, family income, religion, and health condition were captured. Logistic 
regression was used to explore the association of multiple lifestyle behaviors, 
anxiety and depression.
RESULTS: Totally 1,017 participants were included in the study. The prevalence 
of anxiety and depression (from mild to severe) were 40.3% and 45.3%, 
respectively. In multivariable analyses, religion (believe in Buddhism, 
OR = 2.438, 95%CI: 1.097-5.421; believe in Christian, OR = 5.886, 95%CI: 
1.604-21.597), gender (Female, OR = 1.405, 95%CI: 1.001-1.971), secondhand smoke 
exposure (OR = 1.089, 95%CI: 1.001-1.184), and eating regular meals (OR = 0.513, 
95%CI: 0.346-0.759) were associated with anxiety. Family income (OR = 0.732, 
95%CI: 0.596-0.898), eating regular meals (OR = 0.641, 95%CI: 0.415-0.990), 
frequency of breakfast (OR = 0.813, 95%CI: 0.690-0.959), with a chronic disease 
(OR = 1.902, 95%CI: 1.335-2.712), and consumption of nocturnal snack 
(OR = 1.337, 95%CI: 1.108-1.612) were associated with depression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlighted the need for early lifestyle behavior 
intervention, especially modifying diet patterns considering the background of 
religion, health condition, and social-economic status in first-year college 
students to improve their mental health.

BACKGROUND: Depression is the most prevalent cause of illness-induced disability 
worldwide. Face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions for depression can be 
challenging, so there is a need for other alternatives that allow these 
interventions to be offered. One feasible alternative is Internet-based 
psychological interventions. This is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
on the effectiveness of an Internet-based intervention on depression in primary 
health care in Spain.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of a low-intensity 
therapist-guided (LITG) Internet-based program and a completely self-guided 
(CSG) Internet-based program with improved treatment as usual (iTAU) care for 
depression.
METHODS: Multicenter, three-arm, parallel, RCT design, carried out between 
November 2012 and January 2014, with a follow-up of 15 months. In total, 296 
adults from primary care settings in four Spanish regions, with mild or moderate 
major depression, were randomized to LITG (n=96), CSG (n=98), or iTAU (n=102). 
Research completers at follow-up were 63.5%. The intervention was Smiling is 
Fun, an Internet program based on cognitive behavioral therapy. All patients 
received iTAU by their general practitioners. Moreover, LITG received Smiling is 
Fun and the possibility of psychotherapeutic support on request by email, 
whereas CSG received only Smiling is Fun. The main outcome was the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II at 3 months from baseline. Mixed-effects multilevel 
analysis for repeated measures were undertaken.
RESULTS: There was no benefit for either CSG [(B coefficient=-1.15; P=.444)] or 
LITG [(B=-0.71; P=.634)] compared to iTAU, at 3 months. There were differences 
at 6 months [iTAU vs CSG (B=-4.22; P=.007); iTAU vs LITG (B=-4.34; P=.005)] and 
15 months [iTAU vs CSG (B=-5.10; P=.001); iTAU vs LITG (B=-4.62; P=.002)]. There 
were no differences between CSG and LITG at any time. Adjusted and 
intention-to-treat models confirmed these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: An Internet-based intervention for depression combined with iTAU 
conferred a benefit over iTAU alone in the Spanish primary health care system.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression is efficacious, 
but effectiveness is limited when implemented in low-income settings due to 
engagement difficulties including nonadherence with skill-building homework and 
early discontinuation of treatment. Automated messaging can be used in clinical 
settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained 
engagement with psychotherapy.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct 
(mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician 
dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical 
outcomes in a group CBT treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess 
whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions 
attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) symptoms compared with the control condition 
of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino 
patients.
METHODS: Patients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to 
standard group CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same 
treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct 
consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the 
theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood 
data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) 
for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT 
skills.
RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of 
weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed 
in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than 
patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping 
out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=-2.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text 
messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) 
during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 
sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=-1.65, 
P=.10). Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=-.29, 95% CI 
-0.38 to -0.19, z=-5.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions 
(B=-.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.07, z=-3.12, P=.002) experienced significant 
decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, 
the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom 
reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool 
to sustain engagement in CBT for depression over time. There were no differences 
in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low 
follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.

Bipolar disorders are chronic psychiatric conditions characterized by recurrent 
episodes of mania and depression. Affecting over 1% of the global population, 
these disorders contribute significantly to disability and mortality, often due 
to suicide and cardiovascular disease. Diagnostic challenges arise from symptom 
overlap with unipolar depression, frequently leading to delays. Bipolar 
disorders are driven by complex genetic, neurobiological, and environmental 
factors and are commonly accompanied by psychiatric and medical comorbidities, 
further complicating diagnosis and treatment. Standard management strategies 
include mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and selective use of antidepressants, 
complemented by psychosocial interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and 
psychoeducation, which are vital for relapse prevention. Despite recent 
advancements, the management of bipolar disorders remains challenging, 
constrained by clinical variability, an absence of specific biomarkers, and 
differences in approved treatments and treatment guidelines across regions. 
Emerging research underscores the potential of precision psychiatry and digital 
health tools to enhance diagnosis and treatment. Nonetheless, critical gaps 
persist, particularly in implementing equitable care worldwide. This review 
offers a comprehensive update on bipolar disorders, examining clinical 
presentation, early diagnosis, pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies, and future 
perspectives to guide clinicians and researchers in addressing these ongoing 
challenges in research and clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity and depression are inter-related health concerns, 
demanding a high level of treatment and costs in the health care system. The 
development of eHealth interventions that simultaneously address obesity and 
mental health can be supportive in this regard. However, evidence of the 
efficacy of eHealth interventions in the treatment of depression symptoms in 
individuals with obesity is lacking. The aim of this systematic literature 
review is to evaluate the efficacy of existing eHealth interventions for 
individuals with obesity that target depression symptoms.
METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases (Cochrane Library, 
PubMed, Scopus) to identify studies published in English between January 2016 
and January 2023, that focused on eHealth interventions, targeting depression 
symptoms in individuals with obesity people. Exclusion criteria were study 
objectives that (1) focused specifically on one or more metabolic comorbidities 
of individuals with obesity, e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes; (2) 
focused specifically on eating disorders comorbidities e.g., binge eating 
disorder, and (3) focused specifically on patients before or after bariatric 
surgery.
RESULTS: The database search identified 214 records. Six articles were included 
in this review. Sample sizes ranged from 70 to 1267 participants of ages 18-60 
years. All included studies were randomized controlled trials. Two of the six 
included studies were web-based interventions guided either by medical doctors 
or psychologists. All interventions included video, printed materials, and 
interactive parts of which two studies integrated elements of Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy and Social Cognitive Therapy. The findings showed that 
eHealth treatment services, supported and guided throughout the intervention had 
high acceptance and efficacy in the reduction of depression symptoms among 
individuals with obesity.
CONCLUSION: EHealth interventions that address and target both mental and 
physical health with interactive strategies calls for better efficacy in the 
reduction of depression symptoms. Future eHealth interventions that target 
depression symptoms in individuals with obesity should integrate digital 
strategies that address both mental and physical health through interactive 
modules.

Though therapist-guided Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) appears 
to be efficacious for depression, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, 
relatively little is known about real-world settings and predictors of treatment 
effects derived from cognitive-behavioral theory. We examined treatment 
effectiveness and predictors of improvement in a prospective cohort study where 
patients took part in 10 weeks of ICBT for depression (n = 114), social anxiety 
disorder (n = 150), or panic disorder (n = 106) at a teaching clinic. Patients 
self-reported symptoms before, during, and after treatment. Effect sizes were 
large for improvement in the primary symptom domain of each treatment group: 
depression (d = 1.48), social anxiety disorder (d = 1.01), and panic disorder 
(d = 1.15). In ICBT for depression, having no previous experience of 
psychological treatment (r = 0.21), and more frequent baseline negative 
automatic thoughts (r = 0.20) predicted larger improvement. In ICBT for panic 
disorder, having more baseline safety behaviors (r = 0.25) predicted larger 
improvement. Predictors remained significant when baseline symptoms were 
included in the statistical models. We conclude that ICBT can be effective in a 
real-world teaching clinic, and that patients with greater deficits at baseline 
benefit the most.

This article provides an overview of the fields of psychosocial and integrative 
oncology, highlighting common psychological reactions to being diagnosed with 
and treated for cancer, including distress, anxiety, depression, fear of cancer 
recurrence and caregiver burden, as well as symptoms of fatigue, pain, and sleep 
disturbance. Patterns of symptomatology across the disease continuum are also 
discussed. Interventions targeted at treating these symptoms are reviewed, 
including acceptance-based and mindfulness therapies, mind-body therapies, and 
meaning-based approaches designed for people with advanced stages of disease, 
including psychedelic therapy. Common methodological issues and shortcomings of 
the evidence base are summarized with design recommendations, and a discussion 
of trends in future research including pragmatic research design, digital health 
interventions, and implementation science completes the article.

Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established treatment for 
depression, but its success is often impeded by low attendance. Supportive text 
messages assessing participants' mood in between sessions might increase 
attendance to in-clinic CBT, although it is not fully understood who benefits 
most from these interventions and how. This study examined (1) user groups 
showing different profiles of study engagement and (2) associations between 
increased response rates to mood texts and psychotherapy attendance. Methods: We 
included 73 participants who attended Group CBT (GCBT) in a primary care clinic 
and participated in a supportive automated text-messaging intervention. Using 
unsupervised machine learning, we identified and characterized subgroups with 
similar combinations of total texting responsiveness and total GCBT attendance. 
We used mixed-effects models to explore the association between increased 
previous week response rate and subsequent week in-clinic GCBT attendance and, 
conversely, response rate following attendance. Results: Participants could be 
divided into four clusters of overall study engagement, showing distinct 
profiles in age and prior texting knowledge. The response rate to texts in the 
week before GCBT was not associated with GCBT attendance, although the 
relationship was moderated by age; there was a positive relationship for 
younger, but not older, participants. Attending GCBT was, however, associated 
with higher response rate the week after an attended session. Conclusion: User 
groups of study engagement differ in texting knowledge and age. Younger 
participants might benefit more from supportive texting interventions when their 
purpose is to increase psychotherapy attendance. Our results have implications 
for tailoring digital interventions to user groups and for understanding 
therapeutic effects of these interventions.

BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, there is a paucity of health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) research on people with depression as well as a lack of evidence on 
supported self-management (SSM) intervention for depression on HRQoL. This study 
aimed to compare the HRQoL of people with depression and age-matched people in 
the Vietnamese population, evaluate the effects of Tele-SSM intervention on 
HRQoL, and examine the association between the changes in HRQoL score and mental 
health well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress).
METHODS: This study was a pre- and post-study involving Vietnamese adults aged 
18-64 who had depression symptoms (score ≥ 5 points in the PHQ-9). Participants 
(N = 58) completed Tele-SSM-a supported self-management intervention 
incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy and non-violent communication and 
using a task-shifting approach. To compare with the general population, we 
conducted a 1-to-1 matching by age with an EQ-5D-5L valuation study with a 
nationally representative sample of the Vietnamese general population.
RESULTS: HRQoL was significantly impaired in people with depression compared to 
the age-matched general population. Regarding health profile, participants 
reported the most difficulties in usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression dimensions. Significant improvements were observed in HRQoL 
scores post-intervention compared to pre-intervention in both EQ-VAS scores 
(from 59.84 to 79.48) and utility scores (from 0.79 to 0.90). These results 
remained lower than the age-matched general population (EQ-VAS score = 83.28, 
utility score = 0.96). Depression was associated with lower HRQoL while 
controlling for stress, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HRQoL is significantly impaired in 
people with depression and contribute to providing empirical evidence of 
Tele-SSM intervention in improving HRQoL. Further randomized controlled trials 
should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 
Tele-SSM intervention.

Mobile phones can produce detailed and personalized data to help diagnose, 
treat, prevent or rehabilitate women who are victims of gender violence. We sent 
automatic text messages, based on cognitive-behavioural therapy, to female 
victims of gender violence to assess the feasibility of the medium for mental 
health intervention. During the 28-day intervention period, each woman received 
four automatic text messages every day on a pre-established schedule. We 
evaluated symptoms of depression using the Personal Health Questionnaire-9. The 
Personal Health Questionnaire-9 decreased from an average of 14.8 at the 
beginning of the intervention, to 6.1 at the end of the text messaging period. 
All of the women reported that they liked receiving the messages, they found 
them useful and they felt that the messages had improved their health. Text 
messages are acceptable to women users who are recipients of public health and 
social services. Future research should focus more on the evaluation of the 
results and on how the specific content and aspects of text messaging improve 
health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain affects a wide range of physical and psychological 
aspects of life for those impacted. Psychosocial treatment approaches may be of 
support, but outreach is still limited.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of EPIO, an evidence-informed, 
user-centered digital self-management intervention for people with chronic pain, 
in a 12-month randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: People living with chronic pain (N = 266) were randomized to the EPIO 
intervention (n = 132) or a usual-care control group (n = 134). The intervention 
was delivered in a simple blended care model, and outcome measures collected at 
baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Generalized linear models for repeated 
measures were fitted to compare groups over time.
RESULTS: Participants were primarily female (81%), median age 49 years (range 
22-78), with heterogeneous pain conditions, and had lived with pain >5 years 
(77.6%). A mixed linear model with all timepoints included revealed no 
statistically significant group differences for the primary outcome of pain 
interference. Significant psychological benefits in favor of the intervention 
group were however detected for depression (P = 0.022), self-regulatory fatigue 
(P = 0.024), vitality (P = 0.016), and mental health (P = 0.047). Baseline to 
12-month changes showed additional favorable effects for anxiety (between-group 
mean differences [MDs] = 0.79, P = 0.047), depression (MD = 1.08, P = 0.004), 
self-regulatory fatigue (MD = 2.42, P = 0.021), pain catastrophizing (MD = 2.62, 
P = 0.009), and health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The EPIO program aims to improve outreach of evidence-based pain 
self-management interventions. Findings demonstrate how using EPIO can lead to 
sustainable psychological change, enhancing mental health and health-related 
quality of life for people suffering from pain, providing a chance to live well 
with the pain.

INTRODUCTION: Blended therapies (BT) combine face-to-face (f2f) sessions with 
internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). However, the use of blended 
interventions in routine care is still rare and depends on the acceptance of key 
health care professionals such as the therapists. Little is yet known about the 
therapists' perspective on and experiences with blended approaches. The aim of 
this pilot study was to identify barriers and facilitators, as perceived by 
psychotherapists, for implementing a blended therapy for depression.
METHODS: Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with five therapists, 
who were part of the German study arm of the FP7-project E-Compared 
(www.e-compared.eu). All patients (N = 173) were treated in the context of a 
registered RCT (DRKS00006866) in which the clinical and cost-effectiveness of BT 
for depression, consisting of ten internet- and mobile-based cognitive 
behavioral therapy modules and six f2f sessions, was compared to the treatment 
usually provided by general practitioners. To identify barriers and facilitators 
an interview guide based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF) was 
developed. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed 
using a qualitative content analysis by two independent coders.
RESULTS: The results revealed 29 barriers and 33 facilitators, which are 
hindering or enabling factors on the levels of 'implementation in the health 
care system', 'therapy', 'therapists' and 'patients'. Key barriers stated by all 
therapists were 'Limited customizability and autonomy of decisions concerning 
blending the therapy' (number of statements, k = 44); 'Disease-related 
contraindications for BT' (k = 25); 'Negative affect was caused by burden 
through technical problems' (k = 18); 'Limited number of f2f sessions hindered 
the therapy process'; and 'Establishment of therapeutic alliance was burdened by 
technical issues' (each k = 15). Key facilitators stated by all therapists were: 
'Patients' interest, willingness and motivation to participate' (k = 22); 
'Patients' access to online content between f2f sessions and after therapy end' 
(k = 20); 'Preset structure of IMI-part guided the treatment course of BT' 
(k = 18); and 'Effective help with BT in a short time frame' (k = 15), as well 
as 'Reduction of the treatment gap' (k = 13).
DISCUSSION: Therapists supported the implementation of BT for depression. 
Results indicated the consideration of a wide range of determinants: among 
others, the possibility of individualizing the treatment; the autonomy of 
decision making in respect to the ratio and number of online and f2f sessions; 
the necessity of providing training; the need to develop a concept of embedding 
BT in the health care system and funding the additional effort; and the use of 
sophisticated technical solutions.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent condition with significant health, societal, 
and economic impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is 
recommended as the first-line treatment. With limited accessibility to 
in-person-delivered CBTI (ipCBTI), electronically delivered eHealth CBTI 
(eCBTI), ranging from telephone- and videoconference-delivered interventions to 
fully automated web-based programs and mobile apps, has emerged as an 
alternative. However, the relative efficacy of eCBTI compared to ipCBTI has not 
been conclusively determined.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the comparability of eCBTI and ipCBTI through 
a systematic review and meta-analysis of equivalence based on randomized 
controlled trials directly comparing the 2 delivery formats.
METHODS: A comprehensive search across multiple databases was conducted, leading 
to the identification and analysis of 15 unique randomized head-to-head 
comparisons of ipCBTI and eCBTI. Data on sleep and nonsleep outcomes were 
extracted and subjected to both conventional meta-analytical methods and 
equivalence testing based on predetermined equivalence margins derived from 
previously suggested minimal important differences. Supplementary Bayesian 
analyses were conducted to determine the strength of the available evidence.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 15 studies with a total of 1083 
participants. Conventional comparisons generally favored ipCBTI. However, the 
effect sizes were small, and the 2 delivery formats were statistically 
significantly equivalent (P<.05) for most sleep and nonsleep outcomes. 
Additional within-group analyses showed that both formats led to statistically 
significant improvements (P<.05) in insomnia severity; sleep quality; and 
secondary outcomes such as fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Heterogeneity 
analyses highlighted the role of treatment duration and dropout rates as 
potential moderators of the differences in treatment efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: eCBTI and ipCBTI were found to be statistically significantly 
equivalent for treating insomnia for most examined outcomes, indicating eCBTI as 
a clinically relevant alternative to ipCBTI. This supports the expansion of 
eCBTI as a viable option to increase accessibility to effective insomnia 
treatment. Nonetheless, further research is needed to address the limitations 
noted, including the high risk of bias in some studies and the potential impact 
of treatment duration and dropout rates on efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: Insomnia affects over half of pregnant and postpartum women. Early 
evidence indicates that cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) 
improves maternal sleep and mood. However, standard CBTI may be less efficacious 
in perinatal women than the broader insomnia population. This study sought to 
identify patient characteristics in a perinatal sample associated with poor 
response to CBTI, and characterize patient feedback to identify areas of 
insomnia therapy to tailor for the perinatal experience.
PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis of 46 pregnant women with insomnia symptoms who 
were treated with digital CBTI in a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: We assessed insomnia, cognitive arousal, and depression before and 
after prenatal treatment, then 6 weeks postpartum. Patients provided feedback on 
digital CBTI.
RESULTS: Residual cognitive arousal after treatment was the most robust factor 
associated with treatment non-response. Critically, CBTI responders and 
non-responders differed on no other sociodemographic or pretreatment metrics. 
After childbirth, short sleep (<6 hrs/night) was associated with maternal 
reports of poor infant sleep quality. Patient feedback indicated that most 
patients preferred online treatment to in-person treatment. Although women 
described digital CBTI as convenient and helpful, many patients indicated that 
insomnia therapy would be improved if it addressed sleep challenges unique to 
pregnancy and postpartum. Patients requested education on maternal and infant 
sleep, flexibility in behavioral sleep strategies, and guidance to manage infant 
sleep.
CONCLUSIONS: Modifying insomnia therapy to better alleviate refractory cognitive 
arousal and address the changing needs of women as they progress through 
pregnancy and early parenting may increase efficacy for perinatal insomnia.Name:

This narrative historical review examines the development of internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in Sweden, describing its progression within 
both academic and routine care settings. The review encompasses key 
publications, significant scientific findings, and contextual factors in 
real-world settings. Over 25 years ago, Sweden emerged as a pioneering force in 
internet-delivered treatment research for mental health. Since then, Swedish 
universities, in collaboration with research partners, have produced substantial 
research demonstrating the efficacy of ICBT across various psychological 
problems, including social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety 
disorder, and depression. Although research conducted in clinical settings has 
been less frequent than in academic contexts, it has confirmed the effectiveness 
of therapist-supported ICBT programs for mild-to-moderate mental health problems 
in routine care. Early on, ICBT was provided as an option for patients at both 
the primary care level and in specialized clinics, using treatment programs 
developed by both public and private providers. The development of a national 
platform for delivering internet-based treatment and the use of procurement in 
selecting ICBT programs and providers are factors that have shaped the current 
routine care landscape. However, gaps persist in understanding how to optimize 
the integration of digital treatment in routine care, warranting further 
research and the use of specific implementation frameworks and outcomes. This 
historical perspective on the research and delivery of ICBT in Sweden over two 
decades offers insights for the international community into the development and 
broad dissemination of a specific digital mental health intervention within a 
national context.

Suicide prevention programs delivered in school settings have been shown to 
reduce suicide attempts and ideation among adolescents. School-based digital 
interventions targeting at-risk youth are a promising avenue for suicide 
prevention, and some evidence has shown that blending digital and face-to-face 
components may improve the effectiveness. However, further evidence on its 
acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness is needed, especially in Latin 
America, where mental health support is limited. Reframe-IT is an internet-based 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program to reduce youth suicidal ideation in 
school settings. We created four complementary face-to-face CBT sessions and, 
through a pilot study, tested the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness 
of a blended intervention (Reframe-IT +) in adolescents (N = 52) from 6 public 
schools in Chile, randomized into two groups: Reframe-IT + (N = 33) and Control 
(N = 19). We found that the intervention was acceptable and feasible, with high 
degrees of satisfaction and adherence. We also observed a significant reduction 
in suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared 
to the control group at post-intervention. Our results suggest that the 
Reframe-IT + could be delivered as a suitable, acceptable, and effective 
intervention to reduce suicide ideation in adolescents in school settings. 
Further research is needed to confirm these preliminary results.

Background: The way in which computerized therapy is presented may be important 
for its uptake. We aimed to explore adolescents' views on the appeal of a tested 
computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) for depression (SPARX), and a 
revised version (SPARX-R). The versions were similar but while SPARX is 
presented explicitly as a treatment for depression, SPARX-R is presented as 
providing skills that could be useful for young people for when they were 
depressed, down, angry, or stressed. Methods: We held 9 focus groups with a 
total of 79 adolescents (13-19 years old; 47 females; 34 New Zealand European; 
22 Māori or Pacific; 60 reported having experienced feeling down or low for at 
least several days in a row). Groups viewed the opening sequences of SPARX and 
SPARX-R (in random order), then took part in a semi-structured discussion and 
completed a brief questionnaire. Responses were analyzed using a general 
inductive approach. Results: Participants considered both SPARX and SPARX-R 
useful and considered the stated purpose of the program to be important. Four 
themes contrasted the two approaches. The first, "naming depression is risky", 
referred to perceptions that an explicit focus on depression could be 
off-putting, including for adolescents with depression. The second theme of 
"universality" reflected preferences for a universal approach as young people 
might not recognize that they were depressed, and all would benefit from the 
program. In contrast, "validation" reflected the view of a significant minority 
that naming depression could be validating for some. Finally, the theme of 
"choice" reflected a near-unanimously expressed preference for both options to 
be offered, allowing user choice. In questionnaire responses, 40 (68%) of 
participants preferred SPARX-R, 13 (18%) preferred SPARX, while 10 (14%) "didn't 
mind". Responses were similar among participants who reported that they had 
experienced at least a few days of low mood and those who had not. Conclusions: 
The way a CCBT program is presented may have implications for its appeal. The 
potential population impact of CCBT programs explicitly targeting depression and 
those targeting more universal feelings such as being stressed or feeling 
depressed should be explored for varied user groups.

BACKGROUND: Unguided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been 
proven effective for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have 
examined its cost-effectiveness in low-resource countries and under 
nonspecialist routine care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term cost utility of 
unguided ICBT compared to a waitlist control for persons with MDD from the 
perspectives of society and the health care system.
METHODS: This analysis was implemented alongside an 8-week 2-arm randomized 
controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up period conducted in Shenzhen, China. 
Outcomes including cost and health utility were collected at the pretreatment 
and posttreatment time points and 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. 
Direct medical costs and indirect costs were prospectively collected using the 
hospital information system and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Health outcomes 
were measured using the Chinese version of the Short-Form Six-Dimension health 
index. The primary outcome was incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) expressed 
as the difference in costs between 2 therapies by the difference in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The seemingly unrelated regression model 
and the bootstrap method were performed to estimate adjusted ICURs. 
Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were used 
to demonstrate uncertainty. A series of scenario analyses were conducted to 
verify the robustness of base-case results.
RESULTS: In total, 244 participants with MDD were randomly allocated to the ICBT 
(n=122, 50%) or waitlist control (n=122, 50%) groups. At the pretreatment time 
point, no statistically significant difference was observed in direct medical 
cost (P=.41), indirect cost (P=.10), or health utility (P=.11) between the 2 
groups. In the base-case analysis, the ICBT group reported higher direct medical 
costs and better quality of life but lower total costs at the posttreatment time 
point. The adjusted ICURs at the posttreatment time point were CN ¥-194,720.38 
(US $-26,551.50; 95% CI CN ¥-198,766.78 to CN ¥-190,673.98 [US $-27,103.20 to US 
$-25,999.70]) and CN ¥49,700.33 (US $6776.99; 95% CI CN ¥46,626.34-CN ¥52,774.31 
[US $6357.83-$7196.15]) per QALY from the societal and health care system 
perspectives, respectively, with a probability of unguided ICBT being 
cost-effective of 75.93% and 54.4%, respectively, if the willingness to pay was 
set at 1 time the per-capita gross domestic product. In the scenario analyses, 
the probabilities increased to 76.85% and 77.61%, respectively, indicating the 
potential of ICBT to be cost-effective over the long term.
CONCLUSIONS: Unguided ICBT is a cost-effective treatment for MDD. This 
intervention not only helps patients with MDD improve clinically but also 
generates societal savings. These findings provide health economic evidence for 
a potential scalable MDD treatment method in low- and middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety is commonly experienced by people living with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and dementia. Whilst there is strong evidence for late-life 
anxiety treatment using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and delivery via 
telehealth, there is little evidence for the remote delivery of psychological 
treatment for anxiety in people living with MCI and dementia. This paper reports 
the protocol for the Tech-CBT study which aims to investigate the efficacy, 
cost-effectiveness, usability and acceptability of a technology-assisted and 
remotely delivered CBT intervention to enhance delivery of anxiety treatment for 
people living with MCI and dementia of any aetiology.
METHODS: A hybrid II single-blind, parallel-group randomised trial of a Tech-CBT 
intervention (n = 35) versus usual care (n = 35), with in-built mixed methods 
process and economic evaluations to inform future scale-up and implementation 
into clinical practice. The intervention (i) consists of six weekly sessions 
delivered by postgraduate psychology trainees via telehealth video-conferencing, 
(ii) incorporates voice assistant app technology for home-based practice, and 
(iii) utilises a purpose-built digital platform, My Anxiety Care. The primary 
outcome is change in anxiety as measured by the Rating Anxiety in Dementia 
scale. Secondary outcomes include change in quality of life and depression, and 
outcomes for carers. The process evaluation will be guided by evaluation 
frameworks. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of 
participants (n = 10) and carers (n = 10), to evaluate acceptability and 
feasibility, as well as factors influencing participation and adherence. 
Interviews will also be conducted with therapists (n = 18) and wider 
stakeholders (n = 18), to explore contextual factors and barriers/facilitators 
to future implementation and scalability. A cost-utility analysis will be 
undertaken to determine the cost-effectiveness of Tech-CBT compared to usual 
care.
DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to evaluate a novel technology-assisted CBT 
intervention to reduce anxiety in people living with MCI and dementia. Other 
potential benefits include improved quality of life for people with cognitive 
impairment and their care partners, improved access to psychological treatment 
regardless of geographical location, and upskilling of the psychological 
workforce in anxiety treatment for people living with MCI and dementia.

BACKGROUND: Current preventive interventions for the children of parents with 
depression demonstrate modest effects on depression incidence. This may be 
because existing interventions tend to comprise general psychotherapeutic tools, 
rather than targeting the specific mechanisms underlying familial transmission. 
Improved theoretical models of familial transmission could enhance the 
development of targeted interventions. Although existing models assume that 
cognitive and biological vulnerability factors influence one another, the 
precise mechanisms are unknown. This project is the first to experimentally test 
whether negative interpretation bias has an impact on cortisol response in 
children of parents with depression. This study protocol reports a randomised 
controlled trial of an interpretation bias intervention which aims to shift 
participants' interpretation bias in a more positive direction and thereby alter 
their stress response.
METHODS: Children aged 10-14 years who have i) one parent with a current or 
previous depression diagnosis, with at least one episode occurring during the 
child's lifetime and ii) do not have a current or previous psychiatric diagnosis 
themselves, will be assigned to one of two conditions: an interpretation bias 
intervention (n = 50) or a structurally similar placebo intervention (n = 50). 
The interpretation bias intervention consists of a short lab-based cognitive 
reappraisal of interpretations training, a four-week app-based Cognitive Bias 
Modification of Interpretations intervention and interpretation bias specific 
if-then plans. Interpretation bias will be assessed before and after the 
intervention using the Scrambled Sentences Task. The effect of the intervention 
on participants' stress response will be assessed by salivary cortisol collected 
at five different time points: from immediately before until 45 min after 
administering the Trier Social Stressor Test for Children. Stress reactivity 
will be measured via baseline to peak cortisol and stress recovery will be 
measured via the 45 min cortisol marker. We hypothesise that children who 
participate in the interpretation bias intervention will display a positive 
shift in interpretation bias and this, in turn, will alter their stress 
response. Children who receive the placebo intervention are expected to show a 
smaller positive shift in interpretation bias and stress reactivity.
DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study will contribute to models of 
familial depression transmission as well as informing preventive interventions. 
If training a more positive interpretation bias subsequently alters 
participants' stress response, then incorporating such tools may increase the 
efficacy of existing preventive interventions.

IMPORTANCE: Eating disorders (EDs) are common, serious psychiatric disorders on 
college campuses, yet most affected individuals do not receive treatment. 
Digital interventions have the potential to bridge this gap.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a coached, digital, cognitive behavior therapy 
(CBT) intervention improves outcomes for college women with EDs compared with 
referral to usual care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized trial was conducted 
from 2014 to 2018 at 27 US universities. Women with binge-purge EDs (with both 
threshold and subthreshold presentations) were recruited from enrolled 
universities. The 690 participants were followed up for up to 2 years after the 
intervention. Data analysis was performed from February to September 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Universities were randomized to the intervention, Student 
Bodies-Eating Disorders, a digital CBT-guided self-help program, or to referral 
to usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was change in overall ED 
psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were abstinence from binge eating and 
compensatory behaviors, as well as ED behavior frequencies, depression, anxiety, 
clinical impairment, academic impairment, and realized treatment access.
RESULTS: A total of 690 women with EDs (mean [SD] age, 22.12 [4.85] years; 414 
[60.0%] White; 120 [17.4%] Hispanic; 512 [74.2%] undergraduates) were included 
in the analyses. For ED psychopathology, there was a significantly greater 
reduction in the intervention group compared with the control group at the 
postintervention assessment (β [SE], -0.44 [0.10]; d = -0.40; t1387 = -4.23; 
P < .001), as well as over the follow-up period (β [SE], -0.39 [0.12]; 
d = -0.35; t1387 = -3.30; P < .001). There was not a significant difference in 
abstinence from any ED behaviors at the postintervention assessment (odds ratio, 
1.48; 95% CI, 0.48-4.62; P = .50) or at follow-up (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 
0.63-3.58; P = .36). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had 
significantly greater reductions in binge eating (rate ratio, 0.82; 95% 
CI, 0.70-0.96; P = .02), compensatory behaviors (rate ratio, 0.68; 95% 
CI, 0.54-0.86; P < .001), depression (β [SE], -1.34 [0.53]; d = -0.22; 
t1387 = -2.52; P = .01), and clinical impairment (β [SE], -2.33 [0.94]; 
d = -0.21; t1387 = -2.49; P = .01) at the postintervention assessment, with 
these gains sustained through follow-up for all outcomes except binge eating. 
Groups did not differ in terms of academic impairment. The majority of 
intervention participants (318 of 385 participants [83%]) began the 
intervention, whereas only 28% of control participants (76 of 271 participants 
with follow-up data available) sought treatment for their ED (odds ratio, 12.36; 
95% CI, 8.73-17.51; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster randomized clinical trial comparing a 
coached, digital CBT intervention with referral to usual care, the intervention 
was effective in reducing ED psychopathology, compensatory behaviors, 
depression, and clinical impairment through long-term follow-up, as well as 
realizing treatment access. No difference was found between the intervention and 
control groups for abstinence for all ED behaviors or academic impairment. Given 
its scalability, a coached, digital, CBT intervention for college women with EDs 
has the potential to address the wide treatment gap for these disorders.

BACKGROUND: First-episode psychosis most often has its onset during late 
adolescence. In caring for the young person, families endure high levels of 
stress and depression. Meanwhile, the social networks of families often erode. 
Our group has previously shown that family cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) 
leads to significantly improved perceived stress compared with specialist 
first-episode treatment as usual; however, there are well-known barriers to the 
dissemination of effective family interventions. To address this, we have 
developed a novel online intervention entitled 'Altitudes' that fully integrates 
purpose-built online social networking, expert and peer moderation, and 
evidence-based psychoeducation within a single application. The primary aim of 
this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Altitudes in reducing stress in 
carers over a 6-month period.
METHODS/DESIGN: We describe here a single-blinded cluster randomised controlled 
trial (cRCT) with permutated blocks. The clusters comprise individual families. 
The two treatment conditions include Altitudes plus Specialist Treatment as 
Usual (STAU) and STAU alone. Altitudes involves participation in our novel 
online programme whereas STAU comprises specialist family work at the Early 
Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC), Melbourne, Australia. We 
aim to recruit 160 family members of young, 15-27 year-old, patients registered 
for treatment for first-episode psychosis (FEP) at EPPIC. The design includes 
two assessment time points, namely, baseline and 6-month follow-up. The study is 
due for completion within 2 years including an 18-month recruitment period and a 
6-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is carers' perceived stress at 
6 months. Secondary outcome measures include a biomarker of stress, depressive 
symptoms, worry, substance use, loneliness, social support, satisfaction with 
life, and a range of measures that tap into coping resources. We seek to gain a 
dynamic picture of carer stress through our Smartphone Ecological Momentary 
Assessment (SEMA) tool.
DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate 
an online intervention for carers of young people recovering from FEP. It has 
the potential to produce evidence in support of a highly novel, accessible, and 
cost-effective intervention to reduce stress in carers who are providing support 
to young people at a critical phase in their recovery from psychosis.

BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) provides 
critical remote access to mental health care to at-risk populations. However, to 
our knowledge, no investigation has been conducted to understand complex 
pathways through which barriers to care (i.e. structural, attitudinal and 
technological) correlate with patient interest in ICBT.
AIM: The objective of this study is to develop and test a pathway analysis 
framework using structural equation modeling to understand direct and mediating 
associations of barriers to care with interest in ICBT.
METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted among adult 
(>18 years) urban and rural residents (n = 200) in Saskatchewan, Canada. An 
online survey assessed interest in ICBT, barriers to ICBT, demographics, and 
depression and anxiety symptoms. Utilizing structural equation modeling, a path 
analysis framework was developed.
RESULTS: Path analysis results showed how associations between complex barriers 
and demographic variables correlate with interest in ICBT. For instance, the 
negative association of perceived financial concerns and life chaos on interest 
in ICBT was mediated by perceived access to care.
CONCLUSION: The findings identify specific barriers that could be addressed 
through targeted population health interventions to improve uptake of ICBT.

Common mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and other disorders, 
affect many people and incur increasing costs to individuals, employers, and 
government. Several challenges have been identified in the provision of public 
services for people with common mental health problems. A previous study by RAND 
Europe suggested that providing access to online mental health assessment and 
support and building on computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) 
interventions could help reach out to the general population and, in particular, 
those less likely to seek help elsewhere. This study explores online platforms 
and mobile applications that offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for 
people with mental health needs. Overall, this review shows that a variety of 
cCBT products exist which differ both in terms of the conditions products aim to 
address and the ways in which platforms are designed. The tools offer support 
through a varying number of modules (or lessons) clustered around specific 
issues that need to be addressed. The number of modules offered by the tools 
differs slightly by condition: platforms for anxiety disorders and insomnia are 
on average lengthier, with a median number of modules of 9 and 8 respectively, 
compared to those for depression in which the median is 6.5. The majority of 
tools use a linear structure and offer at least some additional guidance, 
although the intensity of this extra support is typically low.

BACKGROUND: Cannabis is among the most widely used drugs, with the literature 
demonstrating that cannabis use disorder (CUD) may be more prevalent than 
previously thought. Research should explore novel approaches to behavioral 
support to meet treatment need, including computer-assisted therapies such as 
Breaking Free Online (BFO). This study aimed to understand how participants' 
baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are associated with 
engagement with BFO, and how both participants' characteristics and their 
engagement may be associated with cannabis use and biopsychosocial functioning 
at follow-up.
METHODS: An observational study with 1830 individuals presenting to UK-based 
publicly funded treatment services who reported cannabis as their primary 
problem substance and engaged with BFO as a self-directed intervention.
RESULTS: Moderate-severe depression/anxiety (51%) and elevated severity of 
cannabis dependence scores (39%) characterized the baseline sample. Women 
demonstrated greater clinical complexity at baseline than men. Baseline mental 
health and biopsychosocial functioning were associated with whether participants 
completed a follow-up assessment. Among 460 participants who completed a 
follow-up assessment, intervention engagement was positively associated with 
self-reported quality of life and biopsychosocial functioning at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis users demonstrated substantial clinical complexity at 
baseline, with depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial functioning being 
associated with BFO engagement. Greater BFO engagement was also associated with 
better quality of life and biopsychosocial functioning at follow-up. Some 
groups, including those with greater mental health and biopsychosocial 
impairment at baseline and women, may require support to engage with BFO to 
maximize clinical benefits.

Effective interventions targeting comorbid obesity and depression are critical 
given the increasing prevalence and worsened outcomes for patients with both 
conditions. RAINBOW is a type 1 hybrid design randomized controlled trial. The 
objective is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness and implementation 
potential of an integrated, technology-enhanced, collaborative care model for 
treating comorbid obesity and depression in primary care. Obese and depressed 
adults (n = 404) will be randomized to usual care enhanced with the provision of 
a pedometer and information about the health system's services for mood or 
weight management (control) or with the Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and 
Weight (I-CARE) program (intervention). The 12-month I-CARE program 
synergistically integrates two proven behavioral interventions: problem-solving 
therapy with as-needed intensification of pharmacotherapy for depression 
(PEARLS) and standardized behavioral treatment for obesity (Group Lifestyle 
Balance(™)). It utilizes traditional (e.g., office visits and phone consults) 
and emerging care delivery modalities (e.g., patient web portal and mobile 
applications). Follow-up assessments will occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. We 
hypothesize that compared with controls, I-CARE participants will have greater 
improvements in weight and depression severity measured by the 20-item 
Depression Symptom Checklist at 12 months, which will be sustained at 24 months. 
We will also assess I-CARE's cost-effectiveness and use mixed methods to examine 
its potential for reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This study 
offers the potential to change how obese and depressed adults are 
treated-through a new model of accessible and integrative lifestyle medicine and 
mental health expertise-in primary care.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent causes of disability 
worldwide, and digital interventions may be one of the ways to meet this need. 
Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that digital interventions can be 
effective in treating chronic pain. This study aimed to establish the clinical 
effectiveness of a web-based pain management programme (PMP), specifically 
whether it would lead to improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care 
costs in a real-world clinical setting.
METHODS: Of 738 participants, 438 engaged with the programme and 300 did not. 
Two analyses were conducted: a within-subjects pre-post comparison of clinical 
outcomes for participants who completed the programme and a between-groups 
comparison of health care usage for those who engaged and those who did not.
RESULTS: Participants who completed the programme made significant improvements 
with regard to their perceived health status, level of disability, mood, 
confidence managing pain, problems in life due to pain and level of pain. Around 
one-third of participants made reliable changes in their levels of disability, 
depression and anxiety. There was no relationship between gender or age and 
engagement with the programme. Those who engaged with the programme demonstrated 
reduced health care costs in the year following referral, whereas health care 
costs of non-engagers increased. Limitations of the study include a high 
drop-out rate and a non-randomised comparison group. Results must therefore be 
interpreted with some caution.
CONCLUSION: A web-based pain management programme can be clinically effective 
and may be a useful addition to the treatments offered by pain management 
services.

Positive adjustment to chronic diseases reduces psychiatric comorbidity and 
enhances quality of life. Very little is known about the benefit of 
internet-based and mobile-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (IM-CBT) on 
physical outcomes and its reciprocal interactions with psychiatric outcomes, the 
active therapeutic elements, and effect moderators among people with major 
chronic medical conditions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis 
(PROSPERO: CRD42022265738), CINAHL of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, 
PubMed, Web of Science are systematically searched up to 1 June 2022, for 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IM-CBT against non-CBT control 
condition(s) among people with chronic disease(s). Primary outcomes include 
improvements in psychiatric symptoms (depressive, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, 
general psychological distress) from baseline to post-intervention and 
follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include improvements in physical distress 
(physical symptoms, functional impairment, self-rated ill health, objective 
physiological dysfunction). Among 44 RCTs (5077 patients with seven different 
chronic diseases), IM-CBT improves depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and 
general psychological distress at post-intervention and across follow-ups, and 
improves physical distress and functional impairment at post-intervention. 
Preliminary evidence suggests that behavioral modification and problem-solving 
could be necessary components to reduce psychiatric symptoms in IM-CBT, whereas 
cognitive restructuring, psychoeducation, and mindfulness elements relate to 
reduced physical distress. IM-CBT shows stronger benefits in chronic pain, 
cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease, relative to other conditions. 
Changes in psychiatric symptoms and physical distress prospectively predict each 
other over time. IM-CBT is an effective intervention for comprehensive symptom 
management among people with chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and serious problem among adolescents, but 
few seek or have access to therapy. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral 
therapies (ICBTs), developed to increase treatment access, show promise in 
reducing depression. The inclusion of coach support in treatment is desired and 
may be needed.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an ICBT 
protocol blended with weekly real-time therapist sessions via chat; blended 
treatment, for adolescent depression, including major depressive episode (MDE). 
The protocol has previously been evaluated in a controlled study.
METHODS: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, adolescents 15 to 19 years of 
age were recruited through a community setting at the national level in Sweden 
(n=70) and allocated to either 8 weeks of treatment or to minimal attention 
control. Depression was assessed at baseline, at posttreatment, and at 12 months 
following treatment (in the intervention group). The primary outcome was 
self-reported depression level as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory II 
at posttreatment. The intervention was offered without the need for parental 
consent.
RESULTS: Over two weeks, 162 adolescents registered and completed the baseline 
screening. Eligible participants (n=70) were on average 17.5 years of age (SD 
1.15), female (96%, 67/70), suffered from MDE (76%, 53/70), had no previous 
treatment experience (64%, 45/70), and reported guardian(s) to be aware about 
their depression state (71%, 50/70). The average intervention completion was 74% 
(11.8 of 16 modules and sessions). Following the treatment, ICBT participants 
demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared with 
controls (P<.001), corresponding to a large between-group effect 
(intention-to-treat analysis: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.37-1.35; of completer analysis: 
d=0.99, 95% CI 0.48-1.51). A significant between-group effect was observed in 
the secondary depression outcome (P=.003); clinically significant improvement 
was found in 46% (16/35) of ICBT participants compared with 11% (4/35) in the 
control group (P=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results are in line with our previous study, further 
demonstrating that adolescents with depression can successfully be engaged in 
and experience significant improvement following ICBT blended with therapist 
chat sessions. Findings on participants' age and baseline depression severity 
are of interest in relation to used study methods.

Lifestyle-oriented non-pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia: a clinical 
overview and applications with home-based technologies.

Friedberg F(1), Williams DA, Collinge W.

(1)Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Stony Brook University, 
Stony Brook, New York.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a persistent and disabling widespread pain condition often 
accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disturbance, 
depression, anxiety, and headache. To date, the most thoroughly studied 
non-pharmacological approaches to managing FM are those with a focus on changing 
patient activities and beliefs that affect the illness. These interventions are 
intended to facilitate enduring improvement in pain and functional status. 
Lifestyle-oriented treatments include patient education, aerobic or other 
physical exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These interventions 
in FM can be delivered in medical or behavioral health care settings by trained 
professionals, through patient-oriented treatment manuals, or via remote-access 
technologies. Non-pharmacological treatments, in particular exercise and CBT, 
have yielded effect sizes and cost-benefit ratios comparable to medications. 
This paper describes lifestyle-oriented non-pharmacological treatments for FM 
and highlights selected literature reviews of these interventions. In addition, 
behavioral and practical issues are addressed that may affect these 
non-pharmacological treatments, including patient expectations, participant 
burden, and treatment availability. Recommendations are made to facilitate these 
interventions and potentially improve outcomes. In particular, the increasing 
availability of convenient home-based mobile technologies to deliver these 
non-pharmacological treatments is described.

This article outlines the development and usability-feasibility testing of an 
automated text-messaging adjunct to cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
depression in a public sector clinic serving low-income patients. The 
text-messaging adjunct is aimed at increasing homework adherence, improving 
self-awareness, and helping track patient progress. Daily text messages were 
sent to patients, inquiring about their mood. Additional daily messages 
corresponded to themes of a manualized group CBT intervention. These included 
(1) thought tracking (both positive and negative), (2) tracking of pleasant 
activities, (3) tracking of positive and negative contacts, and (4) tracking of 
physical well-being. We tested the adjunct in 2 CBT groups (1 English & 1 
Spanish) consisting of 12 patients total during and after treatment. 
Participants responded at a rate of 65% to text messages, and they reported 
overall positive experiences. We propose that text messaging has the potential 
to improve mental health care broadly, and among low-income populations 
specifically, with cost-effective means.

BACKGROUND: Depression has gradually become a common psychological disorder 
among children and adolescents. Depression in children and adolescents affects 
their physical and mental development. Psychotherapy is considered to be one of 
the main treatment options for depressed children and adolescents. However, our 
understanding of the global performance and progress of psychological 
interventions for depression in children and adolescents (PIDCA) research is 
limited.
AIM: To identify collaborative research networks in this field and explore the 
current research status and hotspots through bibliometrics.
METHODS: Articles and reviews related to PIDCA from January 2010 to April 2023 
were identified from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The 
Charticulator website, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to visualize 
the trends in publications and citations, the collaborative research networks 
(countries, institutions, and authors), and the current research status and 
hotspots.
RESULTS: Until April 16, 2023, 1482 publications were identified. The number of 
documents published each year and citations had increased rapidly in this field. 
The United States had the highest productivity in this field. The most prolific 
institution was the University of London. Pim Cuijpers was the most prolific 
author. In the context of research related to PIDCA, both reference co-citation 
analysis and keywords co-occurrence analysis identified 10 research hotspots, 
including third-wave cognitive behavior therapy, short-term psychoanalytic 
psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy, family 
element in psychotherapy, modular treatment, mobile-health, 
emotion-regulation-based transdiagnostic intervention program, dementia risk in 
later life, predictors of the efficacy of psychological intervention, and risks 
of psychological intervention.
CONCLUSION: This bibliometric study provides a comprehensive overview of PIDCA 
from 2010 to present. Psychological intervention characterized as 
psychological-process-focused, short, family-involved, modular, internet-based, 
emotion-regulation-based, and personalized may benefit more young people.

Training, Innovation Incubator, Leuphana University Lüneburg, Lüneburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To review published studies on the effectiveness of 
combining cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) 
to treat comorbid clinical and subclinical alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major 
depression (MDD) and estimate the effect of this compared with usual care.
METHODS: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO and 
Embase up to June 2013 and identified additional studies through 
cross-references in included studies and systematic reviews. Twelve studies 
comprising 1721 patients met our inclusion criteria. The studies had sufficient 
statistical power to detect small effect sizes.
RESULTS: CBT/MI proved effective for treating subclinical and clinical AUD and 
MDD compared with controls, with small overall effect sizes at post-treatment 
[g=0.17, confidence interval (CI)=0.07-0.28, P<0.001 for decrease of alcohol 
consumption and g=0.27, CI: 0.13-0.41, P<0.001 for decrease of symptoms of 
depression, respectively]. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences 
for both AUD and MDD. However, digital interventions showed a higher effect size 
for depression than face-to-face interventions (g= 0.73 and g=0.23, 
respectively, P=0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational 
interviewing for clinical or subclinical depressive and alcohol use disorders 
has a small but clinically significant effect in treatment outcomes compared 
with treatment as usual.

OBJECTIVE: Treatment for tinnitus focuses on supportive therapies. Long waiting 
times in the National Health Service encourage telemedicine options as an 
alternative. This study aimed to review the literature on telemedicine in the 
management of tinnitus and analyse its impact on the burden of tinnitus, 
long-term, anxiety, depression, insomnia and quality of life.
METHOD: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of 
Science were searched. English randomised, controlled trials with adult 
participants suffering from tinnitus were included. A random effects model 
looking at standardised mean differences between intervention and control groups 
was utilised.
RESULTS: Eleven randomised, controlled trials were included. Nine studies looked 
at internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy. A z-value of 9.87 (p < 0.00001; 
I2 = 21 per cent) showed telemedicine approaches may be better at reducing 
tinnitus burden compared with passive controls.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine options have multiple benefits, but more research will 
be needed to conclusively say they are better than alternatives.

BACKGROUND: The past few decades saw considerable advances in research and 
dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapies, yet available treatment 
resources are not able to meet the high need for care for individuals suffering 
from depression or anxiety. Blended care psychotherapy, which combines the 
strengths of therapist-led and internet interventions, can narrow this gap and 
be clinically effective and efficient, but has rarely been evaluated outside of 
controlled research settings.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a blended care intervention 
(video-based cognitive behavior therapy and internet intervention) under 
real-world conditions.
METHODS: This is a pragmatic retrospective cohort analysis of 385 participants 
with clinical range depression and/or anxiety symptoms at baseline, measured 
using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7), who enrolled in blended care psychotherapy treatment. Participants 
resided in the United States and had access to the blended care intervention as 
a mental health benefit offered through their employers. Levels of depression 
and anxiety were tracked throughout treatment. Hierarchical linear modeling was 
used to examine the change in symptoms over time. The effects of age, gender, 
and providers on participants' symptom change trajectories were also evaluated. 
Paired sample t-tests were also conducted, and rates of positive clinical change 
and clinically significant improvement were calculated.
RESULTS: The average depression and anxiety symptoms at 6 weeks after the start 
of treatment were 5.94 and 6.57, respectively. There were significant linear 
effects of time on both symptoms of depression and anxiety (β=-.49, P<.001 and 
β=-.64, P<.001). The quadratic effect was also significant for both symptoms of 
depression and anxiety (β=.04, P<.001 for both), suggesting a decelerated 
decrease in symptoms over time. Approximately 73% (n=283) of all 385 
participants demonstrated reliable improvement, and 83% (n=319) recovered on 
either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 measures. Large effect sizes were observed on both 
symptoms of depression (Cohen d=1.08) and of anxiety (d=1.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Video blended care cognitive behavioral therapy interventions can 
be effective and efficient in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety in 
real-world conditions. Future research should investigate the differential and 
interactive contribution of the therapist-led and digital components of care to 
patient outcomes to optimize care.

BACKGROUND: An effective primary treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD) in children and adolescents as well as adults is exposure and response 
prevention (ERP), a form of intervention in the context of cognitive-behavioral 
therapy. Despite strong evidence supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of 
ERP from studies in research and real-world settings, its clinical use remains 
limited. This underuse is often attributed to access barriers such as the 
scarcity of properly trained therapists, geographical constraints, and costs. 
Some of these barriers may be addressed with virtual behavioral health, 
providing ERP for OCD through video teletherapy and supplemented by app-based 
therapeutic tools and messaging support between sessions. Studies of teletherapy 
ERP in adults with OCD have shown benefits in research and real-world settings 
in both small and large samples. However, studies of teletherapy ERP in children 
and adolescents thus far have been in small samples and limited to research 
rather than real-world settings.
OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the real-world effectiveness of teletherapy ERP 
for OCD in the largest sample (N=2173) of child and adolescent patients to date.
METHODS: Children and adolescents with OCD were treated with live, face-to-face 
video teletherapy sessions, with parent or caregiver involvement, using ERP. 
Assessments were conducted at baseline, after 7-11 weeks, and after 13-17 weeks. 
Additionally, longitudinal assessments of OCD symptoms were performed at weeks 
18-30, 31-42, and 43-54. We analyzed longitudinal outcomes of OCD symptoms, 
depression, anxiety, and stress using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Treatment resulted in a median 38.46% (IQR 12.50%-64.00%) decrease in 
OCD symptoms at 13-17 weeks, and 53.4% of youth met full response criteria at 
this point. Improvements were observed in all categories of starting symptom 
severity: mild (median 40.3%, IQR 8.5%-79.8%), moderate (median 38.4%, IQR 
13.3%-63.6%), and severe (median 34.1%, IQR 6.6%-58.5%). In addition, there were 
significant reductions in the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress 
symptoms. The median amount of therapist involvement was 13 (IQR 10.0-16.0) 
appointments and 11.5 (IQR 9.0-15.0) hours. Further, symptom improvements were 
maintained or improved upon in the longitudinal assessment periods of weeks 
18-30, 31-42, and 43-54.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that remote ERP treatment, assisted by 
technology, can effectively improve both core OCD and related depression, 
anxiety, and stress symptoms in children and adolescents with OCD in a 
real-world setting. Notable outcomes were achieved in a relatively small amount 
of therapist time, demonstrating its efficiency. Demonstrating the usefulness of 
a delivery format that overcomes several traditional barriers to treatment, 
these findings have implications for widespread dissemination of accessible, 
evidence-based care for children and adolescents with OCD.

INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis (AR), anxiety, and depression are prevalent 
comorbidities that negatively impact patients' quality of life. This study 
explored how help-seeking behaviors act as intermediaries between medication 
use, AR symptoms as measured by the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), and 
mental health outcomes, specifically anxiety and depressive symptoms, assessed 
through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD-7).
METHODS: This longitudinal study analyzed data from 1035 adults 18 years and 
older. Participants were recruited from 105 non-allergist primary care clinics 
across the United States using the QHSLab Digital Medicine platform between 
February 20, 2024, and January 18, 2025. Of the original sample, 891 
participants completed the follow-up, yielding an attrition rate of 
approximately 14 %. Health-seeking behavior was defined as seeking professional 
assistance for emotional well-being, allergies, or neither. Baseline medication 
use for intranasal steroids, antihistamines, decongestants, and oral leukotriene 
blockers was recorded. Pearson correlations, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), 
chi-squared test (χ2 test), and regression analyses explored relationships 
between these factors and health score changes (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: Patients who actively sought help for emotional well-being and allergic 
rhinitis exhibited the most significant improvements in symptom severity and 
mental health outcomes. Pearson correlation analyses revealed a significant 
negative association between dual-condition help-seeking and reductions in both 
SNOT-22 (r = -0.22, p < 0.01) and PHQ-GAD scores (r = -0.34, p < 0.01). 
Regression analysis confirmed that help-seeking behaviors (HSB) were significant 
predictors of symptom improvement, with individuals seeking assistance for both 
conditions showing notable reductions in SNOT-22 (β = -0.19, p < 0.05) and 
PHQ-GAD scores (β = -0.28, p < 0.01). Longitudinal analyses further demonstrated 
that consistent HSB engagement over six months led to a 23 % greater reduction 
in SNOT-22 scores (β = -0.21, p = 0.03) and a 31 % greater reduction in PHQ-GAD 
scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.01) compared to pharmacologic interventions alone. 
Sensitivity analyses reaffirmed these findings, and mindfulness meditation 
(β = 3.54, p < 0.001) and allergen immunotherapy (β = 5.60, p = 0.0185) were 
identified as additional predictors of mental health improvement. These results 
highlight integrated care's critical role in addressing physical and mental 
health conditions to optimize patient outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of help-seeking behaviors in 
improving allergic rhinitis and mental health outcomes, highlighting the 
benefits of integrated care approaches. Patients who sought help for both 
conditions experienced the most significant symptom relief, reinforcing the need 
for multidisciplinary, patient-centered treatment. Expanding mental health 
screening within AR management, enhancing access to behavioral interventions, 
and leveraging digital health tools can optimize patient engagement and 
long-term outcomes. These findings advocate for a holistic shift in AR care, 
emphasizing integrating physical and mental health support to improve overall 
well-being.

There is a large body of research showing that psychological treatment can be 
effectively delivered via the internet, and Digital Mental Health Services 
(DMHS) are now delivering those interventions in routine care. However, not all 
attempts to translate these research outcomes into routine care have been 
successful. This paper draws on the experience of successful DMHS in Australia 
and Canada to describe ten lessons learned while establishing and delivering 
internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) and other mental health 
services as part of routine care. These lessons include learnings at four levels 
of analysis, including lessons learned working with (1) consumers, (2) 
therapists, (3) when operating DMHS, and (4) working within healthcare systems. 
Key themes include recognising that DMHS should provide not only treatment but 
also information and assessment services, that DMHS require robust systems for 
training and supervising therapists, that specialist skills are required to 
operate DMHS, and that the outcome data from DMHS can inform future mental 
health policy. We also confirm that operating such clinics is particularly 
challenging in the evolving funding, policy, and regulatory context, as well as 
increasing expectations from consumers about DMHS. Notwithstanding the 
difficulties of delivering DMHS, we conclude that the benefits of such services 
for the broader community significantly outweigh the challenges.

Virtual Reality in Psychotherapy: A Three-Dimensional Framework to Navigate 
Immersive Clinical Applications.

Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming an increasingly prominent tool in 
psychotherapy, offering immersive and personalized experiences that can enhance 
therapeutic processes. However, the diversity and complexity of VR-based 
interventions pose challenges for clinicians and researchers seeking to 
understand and apply this technology effectively. This article introduces a 
three-dimensional conceptual framework to support the analysis, classification, 
and design of VR interventions in psychotherapy. The framework is organized 
around three axes: Strategy (the therapeutic purpose of the VR experience: 
exposure, training, and exploration), Focus (the psychological domain being 
targeted: symptoms, attitudes, and identity/flourishing), and Perspective (the 
point of view or identity adopted within the virtual environment: self, other, 
witness, and multi-perspective). Drawing on five clinical case reports, 
including chronic pain, PTSD, social anxiety, depression, and psychosis, this In 
Session issue illustrates how VR can be harnessed across diverse therapeutic 
aims and models (cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment 
therapy, systemic therapy, and personal construct therapy) to foster therapeutic 
breakthroughs. By presenting both well-established and innovative uses of VR, 
this issue offers valuable insights into how virtual environments can extend the 
boundaries of psychotherapy and address complex psychological challenges in 
novel, impactful, and transformative ways.

BACKGROUND: The use of digital mental health programs such as internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) holds promise in increasing the quality and 
access of mental health services. However very little research has been 
conducted in understanding the feasibility of implementing iCBT in Eastern 
Europe.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to qualitatively assess organizational 
readiness for implementing iCBT for depression within community mental health 
centers (CMHCs) across Albania and Kosovo.
METHODS: We used qualitative semistructured focus group discussions that were 
guided by Bryan Weiner's model of organizational readiness for implementing 
change. The questions broadly explored shared determination to implement change 
(change commitment) and shared belief in their collective capability to do so 
(change efficacy). Data were collected between November and December 2017. A 
range of health care professionals working in and in association with CMHCs were 
recruited from 3 CMHCs in Albania and 4 CMHCs in Kosovo, which were 
participating in a large multinational trial on the implementation of iCBT 
across 9 countries (Horizon 2020 ImpleMentAll project). Data were analyzed using 
a directed approach to qualitative content analysis, which used a combination of 
both inductive and deductive approaches.
RESULTS: Six focus group discussions involving 69 mental health care 
professionals were conducted. Participants from Kosovo (36/69, 52%) and Albania 
(33/69, 48%) were mostly females (48/69, 70%) and nurses (26/69, 38%), with an 
average age of 41.3 years. A directed qualitative content analysis revealed 
several barriers and facilitators potentially affecting the implementation of 
digital CBT interventions for depression in community mental health settings. 
While commitment for change was high, change efficacy was limited owing to a 
range of situational factors. Barriers impacting "change efficacy" included lack 
of clinical fit for iCBT, high stigma affecting help-seeking behaviors, lack of 
human resources, poor technological infrastructure, and high caseload. 
Facilitators included having a high interest and capability in receiving 
training for iCBT. For "change commitment," participants largely expressed 
welcoming innovation and that iCBT could increase access to treatments for 
geographically isolated people and reduce the stigma associated with mental 
health care.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, participants perceived iCBT positively in relation to 
promoting innovation in mental health care, increasing access to services, and 
reducing stigma. However, a range of barriers was also highlighted in relation 
to accessing the target treatment population, a culture of mental health stigma, 
underdeveloped information and communications technology infrastructure, and 
limited appropriately trained health care workforce, which reduce organizational 
readiness for implementing iCBT for depression. Such barriers may be addressed 
through (1) a public-facing campaign that addresses mental health stigma, (2) 
service-level adjustments that permit staff with the time, resources, and 
clinical supervision to deliver iCBT, and (3) establishment of a suitable 
clinical training curriculum for health care professionals.

AIM: To evaluate and synthesize evidence on the impact of self-management 
interventions in improving behavioral and clinical outcomes among individuals 
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across eight electronic 
databases-CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ProQuest, PubMed, Medline with Full Text, 
SAGE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science-to identify studies published 
from inception to 2024. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental 
studies assessing self-management interventions in individuals with SLE were 
included. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute 
critical appraisal tools. Data synthesis followed a convergent integrated 
analysis framework to identify recurring themes and subthemes.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 10 
randomized controlled trials (66.67%) and 5 quasi-experimental studies (33.33%). 
The interventions targeted physical, mental, and behavioral health through 
various strategies. The most common interventions included counseling and 
education (7 studies, 22.58%), followed by physical activity programs (2 
studies, 6.45%), and self-management sessions (2 studies, 6.45%). Other 
interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, strengthening exercises, 
and digital health tools, were also implemented. In-person interventions 
(46.67%) were the most common delivery format, followed by digital platforms 
(26.67%). Self-management interventions led to significant improvements in 
physical health (eg, reduced fatigue and improved functional capacity), mental 
health (eg, reduced anxiety and depression), and health behaviors (eg, enhanced 
adherence to treatment and self-care practices). Furthermore, the interventions 
contributed to an improved quality of life by addressing the physical, 
psychological, and social challenges faced by individuals with SLE.
CONCLUSION: Self-management interventions positively impact behavioral and 
clinical outcomes in individuals with SLE. Future research should explore 
long-term sustainability, integration of digital health strategies, and 
personalized approaches. Expanding access to self-management programs, 
particularly in low-resource settings, may further enhance outcomes for 
individuals with SLE.

Improving Suicide Prevention Through Evidence-Based Strategies: A Systematic 
Review.

OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to identify scalable evidence-based suicide 
prevention strategies.
METHODS: A search of PubMed and Google Scholar identi- fied 20,234 articles 
published between September 2005 and December 2019, of which 97 were randomized 
controlled trials with suicidal behavior or ideation as primary outcomes or 
epidemiological studies of limiting access to lethal means, using educational 
approaches, and the impact of antidepressant treatment.
RESULTS: Training primary care physicians in depression rec- ognition and 
treatment prevents suicide. Educating youths on depression and suicidal 
behavior, as well as active out- reach to psychiatric patients after discharge 
or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that 
antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled 
trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours 
but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy 
and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for 
suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for 
depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks 
effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training 
for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health 
record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to 
identify high-risk patients are under-studied. Means restriction, including of 
firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, 
even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.
CONCLUSIONS: Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and 
testing in other nonpsychiatrist physi- cian settings. Active follow-up of 
patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and 
restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. 
Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide

OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to identify scalable evidence-based suicide 
prevention strategies.
METHODS: A search of PubMed and Google Scholar identified 20,234 articles 
published between September 2005 and December 2019, of which 97 were randomized 
controlled trials with suicidal behavior or ideation as primary outcomes or 
epidemiological studies of limiting access to lethal means, using educational 
approaches, and the impact of antidepressant treatment.
RESULTS: Training primary care physicians in depression recognition and 
treatment prevents suicide. Educating youths on depression and suicidal 
behavior, as well as active outreach to psychiatric patients after discharge or 
a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that 
antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled 
trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours 
but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy 
and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for 
suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for 
depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks 
effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training 
for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health 
record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to 
identify high-risk patients are understudied. Means restriction, including of 
firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, 
even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.
CONCLUSIONS: Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and 
testing in other nonpsychiatrist physician settings. Active follow-up of 
patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and 
restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. 
Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide 
in several countries, but evaluating the benefit attributable to each component 
is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating newer 
approaches, such as electronic health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based 
screening methods, ketamine's potential benefit for preventing attempts, and 
passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change.

OBJECTIVES: This research is the first study to investigate the potential 
effects of a laughter prescription on both psychological health and objective 
sleep parameters in university students. The primary objective is to evaluate 
the feasibility of prescribing laughter to inform a larger randomised controlled 
trial. Secondary objectives are to assess if a two-week laughter prescription 
improves subjective and objective sleep outcomes, wellbeing, and/or 
psychological health outcomes.
TRIAL DESIGN: To assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial for 
laughter prescription in relation to sleep, psychological health, and wellbeing. 
Forty university students will be recruited and randomised to one of two 
conditions (control/experimental).
METHODS: Wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries will be used to estimate sleep 
outcomes during a one-week baseline testing phase and across the two-week 
intervention. The experimental group will be shown how to record a Laughie (a 
1-min recording of their joyful laughter on their smartphone) and prescribed to 
laugh with it three times daily for 14 days (the control group will only track 
sleep). All participants will complete the WHO (Five) Well-being Index, and 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale pre- and post-intervention. The CONSORT 
checklist, and the Feasibility, Reach-out, Acceptability, Maintenance, Efficacy, 
Implementation, and Tailorabilty (FRAME-IT) framework will guide intervention 
planning and evaluation. Participant interviews will be analysed using 
Differential Qualitative Analysis (DQA).
RESULTS: The feasibility of a two-week laughter prescription in university 
students and its impact on sleep, wellbeing, and/or psychological health 
outcomes will be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: Zayed University Research Ethics Committee approved the study in 
July 2019. The research will be completed following protocol publication.

AIMS: This study will assess the efficacy of digital CBT for insomnia (dCBT-I) 
compared to sleep hygiene education (SHE) for the management of insomnia in 
women with cancer.
BACKGROUND: 30% of patients with cancer meet insomnia diagnostic criteria and 
this can be detrimental to health outcomes. Insomnia disorder comprises a 
dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality characterized by difficulty 
initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, or early morning wakening without the 
ability to return to sleep, at least 3 nights per week, for at least 3 months, 
causing significant impairment or distress in areas of functioning.
METHODS: We will recruit 308 women with a current or prior cancer diagnosis who 
are currently experiencing insomnia; defined as a score of 16 or less on the 
Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI). Participants will be randomised to dCBT-I or 
SHE. dCBT-I will be delivered online via 6 sessions. SHE will be provided in an 
online format. Assessments of sleep and other related parameters, through 
validated questionnaires, will be taken at 12 and 24 weeks following 
intervention. Once 24 week assessments are completed, participants will 
crossover to the alternate arm (either SHE or dCBT-I) and undergo a final 
assessment at week 36.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the mean continuous change in SCI score in 
the intervention arm compared to the control arm at 24 weeks. Additionally, the 
proportion of women with an SCI > 16 at 24 weeks will be assessed. Secondary 
outcomes include fatigue, sleep related quality of life, depression, anxiety, 
and hot flush interference.
REGISTRATION: This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with number 
NCT05816460.

In Veterans Health Administration's (VA) Primary Care-Mental Health Integration 
(PC-MHI) models, primary care providers, care managers, and mental health 
clinicians collaboratively provide depression care. Primary care patients, 
however, still lack timely, sufficient access to psychotherapy treatment. 
Adapting PC-MHI collaborative care to improve uptake of evidence-based 
computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) may be a potential solution. 
Understanding primary care-based mental health clinician perspectives is crucial 
for facilitating adoption of cCBT as part of collaborative depression care. We 
examined PC-MHI mental health clinicians' perspectives on adapting collaborative 
care models to support cCBT for VA primary care patients. We conducted 16 
semi-structured interviews with PC-MHI nurse care managers, licensed social 
workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists in one VA health-care system. 
Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using the constant 
comparative method, and analyzed for overarching themes. Although cCBT awareness 
and knowledge were not widespread, participants were highly accepting of 
enhancing PC-MHI models with cCBT for depression treatment. Participants 
supported cCBT delivery by a PC-MHI care manager or clinician and saw it as an 
additional tool to engage patients, particularly younger Veterans, in mental 
health treatment. They commented that current VA PC-MHI models did not 
facilitate, and had barriers to, use of online and mobile treatments. If 
effectively implemented, however, respondents thought it had potential to 
increase the number of patients they could treat. There is widespread interest 
in modernizing health systems. VA PC-MHI mental health clinicians appear open to 
adapting collaborative care to increase uptake of cCBT to improve psychotherapy 
access.

Many women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) report high depression rates. 
The relationship between PCOS and these high depression rates is unclear. 
Two-component lifestyle interventions have revealed short-term effects on 
depression scores in this group of women. In general, 3-component interventions 
including diet, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are more 
effective in the long-term to improve emotional well-being. This has not yet 
been studied in women with PCOS. This study examined the effect of 20 CBT 
lifestyle (LS) sessions combined with a healthy diet and physical therapy with 
or without 9 months additional feedback through Short Message Service (SMS) via 
mobile phone, compared to care as usual (CAU, involving advice to lose weight). 
In this secondary analysis, 155 women with PCOS and a BMI above 25 kg/m2 were 
eligible. Depression scores decreased significantly in the LS programme compared 
to CAU (P = 0.045). In both the LS programme without SMS (P = 0.036) and the LS 
programme with SMS (P = 0.011) depression scores decreased while no change was 
observed in CAU (P = 0.875). Self-esteem scores improved significantly in the LS 
programme compared to CAU (P = 0.027). No differences in body image scores were 
observed in LS participants compared to CAU (P = 0.087), although body image 
improved significantly in both the LS without SMS (P = 0.001) and with SMS (P = 
0.008) study arms. We found no significant mediating role by androgens in the 
relationship between LS participants and emotional well-being. Only weight-loss 
mediated the relationship between LS and self-esteem. To conclude, a 
three-component lifestyle intervention programme with or without additional SMS 
resulted in significant improvements in depression and self-esteem compared to 
CAU, in women with PCOS, obesity, and a wish to achieve a pregnancy. 
Testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, insulin, HOMA-IR, and cortisol did not 
mediate this effect. Weight loss mediated the effects on self-esteem but not on 
depression and body-image. This suggests that lifestyle treatment independent of 
weight loss can reduce depression and body-image, but both lifestyle treatment 
and weight loss can improve self-esteem. Thus, a three-component lifestyle 
intervention based on CBT could prove successful in improving mood in women with 
PCOS who are overweight or obese and attempting to become pregnant.

BACKGROUND: To address the lack of mental health practitioners in developing 
countries, the current study explored the feasibility of a newly developed 
self-guided digital intervention program TEA (training for emotional adaptation) 
in alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms, as one of a few studies which 
adapted from theoretical models with effective intervention techniques.
METHODS: The first part of this study involved 11 professional mental health 
practitioners giving feedback on the feasibility of the TEA; while the second 
part involved a mixed-method single-arm study with 32 participants recruited 
online, who went through the seven intervention sessions within 14 days. The 
questionnaires were collected before, after, 14 days after, and 30 days after 
intervention. Additionally, 10 participants were invited to semi-structured 
interviews regarding their suggestions.
RESULTS: Practitioners thought that the TEA showed high professionalism 
(8.91/10) and is suitable for treating emotional symptoms (8.09/10). The 
generalized estimating equation model showed that the TEA significantly reduced 
participants' depressive and anxiety symptoms, while the effects of the 
intervention remained 30 days post intervention (Cohen's d > 1). Thematic 
analysis revealed three main themes about future improvement, including content 
improvement, interaction improvement, and bug-fixing.
CONCLUSIONS: To address the current needs for digital mental health intervention 
programs to account for the insufficient availability of mental health services 
in China, the current study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness 
of TEA, with the potential to address the urgent need for remote mental health 
services.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial

OBJECTIVE: ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder that is known for its high degree of heterogeneity. 
It often coexists with other psychiatric diseases, especially anxiety and 
depression. This article reviews recent studies to explore the etiology of 
comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders in adults with ADHD, analyzing the 
factors contributing to this elevated comorbidity rate from several 
perspectives. Additionally, we explore potential directions for future research 
in this field.
RECENT FINDINGS: ADHD exhibits a high comorbidity rate with anxiety and 
depressive disorders, due to overlapping and interacting symptoms. Individuals 
with two or more comorbid conditions often experience increased disease burden, 
prolonged illness duration, and diminished treatment efficacy. The underlying 
causes of comorbid anxiety and depression in ADHD patients are highly complex 
and can be understood from multiple dimensions, including genetics, 
neurobiology, neurocognition, and neuroimaging. This complexity poses 
significant challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the 
management of ADHD patients with concurrent depression or anxiety may involve 
pharmaceutical interventions combined with non-pharmacological strategies, 
including psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, CBT) and digital 
therapeutics. For patients with comorbid illnesses, these intergrated approaches 
have demonstrated significant improvements in symptom relief and quality of life 
enhancement.
SUMMARY: ADHD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with a significant comorbidity 
rate. Recent research has elucidated the pathogenetic mechanisms of ADHD 
comorbid with depression and anxiety disorders from multiple perspectives. To 
improve patient functioning, enhance their quality of life, and guide more 
effective treatments, Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying 
causes of these comorbid conditions.

Innovative moments in low-intensity, telephone-based cognitive-behavioral 
therapy for depression.

BACKGROUND: Innovative moments (IMs), defined as moments in psychotherapy when 
patients' problematic patterns change toward more elaborated and adaptive 
patterns, have been shown to be associated with a clinical change in patients 
with depression. Thus, far IMs have been studied in face-to-face settings but 
not in telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (t-CBT). This study 
investigates whether IMs occur in t-CBT and examines the association between IMs 
and symptom improvement, and reconceptualization and symptom improvement.
METHODS: The therapy transcripts of n = 10 patients with mild to moderate 
depression (range: 7-11 sessions, in total 94 sessions) undergoing t-CBT were 
qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Symptom severity (Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9) and IMs (levels and proportions) were assessed for each therapy 
session. Hierarchical linear models were used to test the prediction models.
RESULTS: The rating of IMs was shown to be feasible and reliable using the 
Innovative Moments Coding System (IMCS) (84.04% agreement in words coded), which 
is indicative of the applicability of the concept of IMs in t-CBT. Only 
reconceptualization IMs were shown to have a predictive value for treatment 
success (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.01).
DISCUSSION: The results should be interpreted with caution due to the 
exploratory nature of this study. Due to the telephone setting, it was necessary 
to adapt the IMCS. Nonetheless, the extent of IMs identified in the 
low-intensity t-CBT investigated was comparable to IMs in face-to-face therapy. 
Further studies are needed to clarify the association between IMs and treatment 
success as a change process, especially for low-intensity treatments.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the prevalence of depressive disorders among youth, there is 
no health system model to address the prevention of these disorders.
METHOD: With the goal of creating effective, tolerable, and scalable 
interventions for the prevention of adolescent depression, we have fielded three 
randomized clinical trials, centered in health care delivery organizations that 
use a whole-of-society approach: (a) Path 2 Purpose (N = 664), comparing the 
Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral, Humanistic, and 
Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT; B. W. Van Voorhees et al., 2015), guided 
digital health intervention to a synchronous mental health specialist-led group 
cognitive behavioral intervention, Coping with Depression Course-Adolescent; (b) 
PATHway (N = 400), examining the efficacy of the CATCH-IT components; and (c) 
Behavioral Health Stratified Treatment (N = 780), which examines the feasibility 
and potential benefit of a coordinated care, risk stratification, and 
intervention matching approach for adolescents with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities using both CATCH-IT (lower risk) and the Coping with 
Depression Course-Adolescent (higher risk).
RESULTS: The study samples for all three trials include youth from traditionally 
underrepresented groups (71.8%) with some economic distress (47.6%). 
Intervention utilization was moderate across trials. Feedback from study teams 
reveals general barriers to implementation and challenges specific to the 
pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: We review these trials, report preliminary data on demographics and 
intervention utilization, and provide feedback from study teams on 
implementation challenges encountered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA,

Perinatal depression affects one in four women in low- and middle-income 
countries. The World Health Organization's Thinking Healthy Programme (WHO-THP) 
is an established 'task-shared' cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for 
perinatal depression. However, efforts to scale up are hampered by overburdened 
health systems struggling to maintain quality and fidelity. Here, to overcome 
these challenges, we coproduced with end users a technology-assisted digital 
version of the THP delivered by lived-experience peers (technology-assisted 
peer-delivered THP (THP-TAP)). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of THP-TAP 
compared to the established WHO-THP. A single-blind cluster-randomized 
controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan, 
with 70 village clusters randomly distributed to the two interventions. From 
June 2022 to May 2023, we recruited 980 women with perinatal depression 
registered with primary healthcare centers. The primary outcome was remission 
from the depressive episode at 3 months postnatal. On assessment of 846/980 
(86.3%) participants at 3 months postnatal, the difference in the remission rate 
was 8.91% with the lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval 
being 4.25%, larger than the prespecified -10% noninferiority margin 
(Pnoninferiority < 0.0001). In settings where health systems are weak and 
overburdened, THP-TAP offers an effective and potentially scalable alternative 
to the delivery of psychosocial interventions. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

BACKGROUND: The considerable rise of mental health challenges during the 
COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental effects on the public health sector and 
economy. To meet the overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, 
innovative approaches must be employed to significantly expand mental health 
care delivery capacity. Although it is not feasible to increase the number of 
mental health care providers or hours they work in the short term, improving 
their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtually and digitally 
delivering psychotherapy, which has been shown to be efficient and clinically 
effective, might be a good method for addressing this growing demand.
OBJECTIVE: This research protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy 
of using an online, digital, asynchronous care model to treat mental health 
issues that are started or aggravated by stressors associated with the COVID-19 
pandemic.
METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will be delivered 
through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental 
health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week electronically delivered 
cognitive behavioral therapy program that is tailored to address mental health 
problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve 
weekly self-guided educational material that provides an overview of behavioral 
skills and weekly homework. Participants (N=80) will receive personalized 
feedback from and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of 
the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically 
validated symptomology questionnaires, which are to be completed by participants 
at baseline, week 5, and posttreatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity 
to consent; a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder or major 
depressive disorder, with symptoms that started or worsened during the COVID-19 
pandemic; the ability to speak and read English; and consistent and reliable 
access to the internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute 
mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or 
homicidal ideation.
RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received 
in June 2020. The recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant 
recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and 
physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (intervention 
group: n=35; control group: n=23). Data collection is expected to conclude by 
the end of 2020. Analyses (ie, linear regression analysis for continuous 
outcomes and binomial regression analysis for categorical outcomes) are expected 
to be completed by February 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: If proven feasible, this care delivery method could increase care 
capacity by up to fourfold. The findings from this study can potentially 
influence clinical practices and policies and increase accessibility to care 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, without sacrificing the quality of care.

BACKGROUND: Caregiving for a family member can result in reduced well-being for 
the caregiver. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) may be one 
way to support this population. This is especially the case for caregivers in 
countries with limited resources, but high demand for psychological services.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the effects of a therapist-guided 
8-week-long ICBT intervention for informal caregivers.
METHODS: In total, 63 participants were recruited online and randomized either 
to the intervention or to the wait-list control group. The main study outcome 
was the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes included measures 
of caregiver depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Moderate between-group effect sizes were observed for the CBI measure, 
in favor of the intervention group, with a Cohen d=-0.70 for the 
intention-to-treat analysis. Analyses of the subscales of the CBI showed 
significant reductions on the subscales of Development and Physical Health. 
Moderate reductions were found for depression and anxiety scores as indicated by 
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7) scores. Large between-group effects were observed for reduction in 
stress and increase in quality of life as indicated by the Perceived Stress 
Scale-14 (PSS-14), The Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Scale (BBQ), and The 
World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5). In addition, 
participants experienced little to no difficulty in using the program and were 
mostly satisfied with the intervention's platform and the choice of content.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first internet intervention study for informal 
caregivers in Lithuania. The results suggest that therapist-guided ICBT can be 
effective in reducing caregiver burden, anxiety, depression, stress, and 
improving quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Symptoms of anxiety are common in pregnancy, with severe symptoms 
associated with negative outcomes for women and babies. Low-level psychological 
therapy is recommended for women with mild to moderate anxiety, with the aim of 
preventing an escalation of symptoms and providing coping strategies. Remotely 
delivered interventions have been suggested to improve access to treatment and 
support and provide a cost-effective, flexible, and timely solution.
OBJECTIVE: This study identifies and evaluates remotely delivered, digital, or 
web-based interventions to support women with symptoms of anxiety during 
pregnancy.
METHODS: This mixed methods systematic review followed a convergent segregated 
approach to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data. The ACM Digital 
Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Applied Social Sciences 
Index and Abstracts, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, 
Health Technology Assessment Library, IEEE Xplore, Joanna Briggs Institute, 
Maternity and Infant Care, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Social Science Citation 
Index were searched in October 2020. Quantitative or qualitative primary 
research that included pregnant women and evaluated remotely delivered 
interventions reporting measures of anxiety, fear, stress, distress, women's 
views, and opinions were included.
RESULTS: Overall, 3 qualitative studies and 14 quantitative studies were 
included. Populations included a general antenatal population and pregnant women 
having anxiety and depression, fear of childbirth, insomnia, and preterm labor. 
Interventions included cognitive behavioral therapy, problem solving, 
mindfulness, and educational designs. Most interventions were delivered via 
web-based platforms, and 62% (8/13) included direct contact from trained 
therapists or coaches. A meta-analysis of the quantitative data found 
internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and facilitated interventions showed 
a beneficial effect in relation to the reduction of anxiety scores (standardized 
mean difference -0.49, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22; standardized mean difference 
-0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22). Due to limitations in the amount of available 
data and study quality, the findings should be interpreted with caution. 
Synthesized findings found some evidence to suggest that interventions are more 
effective when women maintain regular participation which may be enhanced by 
providing regular contact with therapists or peer support, appropriate targeting 
of interventions involving components of relaxation and cognitive-based skills, 
and providing sufficient sessions to develop new skills without being too time 
consuming.
CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to suggest that women who are pregnant 
may benefit from remotely delivered interventions. Components of interventions 
that may improve the effectiveness and acceptability of remotely delivered 
interventions included providing web-based contact with a therapist, health care 
professional, or peer community. Women may be more motivated to complete 
interventions that are perceived as relevant or tailored to their needs. Remote 
interventions may also provide women with greater anonymity to help them feel 
more confident in disclosing their symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Advances in technology are progressively more relevant to the 
clinical practice of psychology and mental health services generally. Studies 
indicate that technology facilitates the delivery of interventions, such as 
cognitive behavioral therapy, in the treatment of psychological disorders in 
adults, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic 
symptoms, and eating disorders. Fewer data exist for computer-based 
(stand-alone, self-help) and computer-assisted (in combination with face-to-face 
therapy, or therapist guided) programs for youth.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to summarize and critically review the literature 
evaluating the acceptability and efficacy of using technology with treatment and 
prevention programs for anxiety in young children and adolescents. The aim was 
to improve the understanding of what would be critical for future development of 
effective technology-based interventions.
METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of the literature through searches 
in 3 scientific electronic databases (PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and PubMed). We 
used keywords in various combinations: child or children, adolescent, preschool 
children, anxiety, intervention or treatment or program, smartphone applications 
or apps, online or Web-based tool, computer-based tool, internet-based tool, 
serious games, cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT, biofeedback, and 
mindfulness. For inclusion, articles had to (1) employ a technological 
therapeutic tool with or without the guidance of a therapist; (2) be specific 
for treatment or prevention of anxiety disorders in children or adolescents; (3) 
be published between 2000 and 2018; and (4) be published in English and in 
scientific peer-reviewed journals.
RESULTS: We identified and examined 197 articles deemed to be relevant. Of 
these, we excluded 164 because they did not satisfy 1 or more of the 
requirements. The final review comprised 19 programs. Published studies 
demonstrated promising results in reducing anxiety, especially relative to the 
application of cognitive behavioral therapy with technology. For those programs 
demonstrating efficacy, no difference was noted when compared with traditional 
interventions. Other approaches have been applied to technology-based 
interventions with inconclusive results. Most programs were developed to be used 
concurrently with traditional treatments and lacked long-term evaluation. Very 
little has been done in terms of prevention interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Future development of eHealth programs for anxiety management in 
children will have to address several unmet needs and overcome key challenges. 
Although developmental stages may limit the applicability to preschool children, 
prevention should start in early ages. Self-help formats and personalization are 
highly relevant for large-scale dissemination. Automated data collection should 
be built in for program evaluation and effectiveness assessment. And finally, a 
strategy to stimulate motivation to play and maintain high adherence should be 
carefully considered.

BACKGROUND: Medical school typically presents students with a combination of 
academic and personal stressors that may lead to substandard mental health 
wellbeing. Meditation practices such as mindfulness facilitate a greater 
awareness of one's thoughts and feelings, thereby decreasing emotional 
reactivity. The use of mindfulness-based interventions delivered online has 
considerable potential in fostering self-care and helping medical students to 
handle mental health challenges. We examined the available evidence on the use 
of online mindfulness interventions in order to determine whether they are 
feasible and effective for improving medical students' mental health.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review guided by PRISMA guidelines and 
utilised the following databases: ProQuest, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of 
Science, IEEE Explore, Cochrane, and CINAHL. The key search terms used include 
mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, 
online, web, virtual, internet cyber, app, medical students, residency students, 
and residents. English-language articles published in the last ten years that 
described online interventions for medical students or residents were included 
in the review.
RESULTS: Two studies describing the impact of online mindfulness interventions 
on medical students' mental health were identified. Research in this domain is 
nascent; available qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests benefits in 
self-compassion, perceived stress, cognitive skill use, mindfulness, creating 
coping mechanisms, and greater awareness of emotions and feelings. There was no 
evidence of the effectiveness of online mindfulness interventions on depression, 
anxiety and burnout. There was, however, general low program usage and 
participation tended to diminish near the conclusion of the interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in the systematic review exhibits the potential 
for online mindfulness interventions to be effective in addressing some mental 
health challenges of medical students. There was insufficient evidence to 
support the use of online mindfulness interventions for burnout, depression, and 
anxiety. Longitudinal studies with randomised controlled trials are required to 
generate stronger and robust evidence.

BACKGROUND: With the continuous improvement of people's material living 
standards, the consumption of alcoholic beverages is increasing. Alcohol 
dependence caused by alcohol addiction has become a widespread concern in 
society. As the brand-new medical and health model created by the modern 
biomedical technology revolution and the information technology revolution, 
mobile health has been used more and more widely in the field of medical health 
with the characteristics of convenience, rapidity and generalisability. With the 
general use of the social software WeChat, it is feasible to implement mobile 
health on the WeChat platform.
AIM: We aimed to explore the clinical effect of WeChat platform used in the 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the maintenance period of alcohol 
dependence and addiction.
METHODS: Seventy alcohol-dependent patients in the withdrawal maintenance stage 
admitted into our hospital were randomly divided into the CBT on WeChat platform 
group (the experiment group, n=35) and the general clinical treatment using 
sertraline group (the control group, n=35) with block randomisation grouping. 
They were evaluated with the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire 
(SADQ-C) before the treatment, at the end of the fourth week, at the end of the 
eighth week and at the end of the twelfth week of treatment. In addition, Zung's 
Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were 
employed to evaluate the degree of anxiety and depression of the two groups.
RESULTS: The SADQ-C, SAS and SDS scores of the two groups after treatment 
decreased markedly compared with those before treatments, and the differences 
were statistically significant. Between-group comparison: the SADQ-C scores of 
the experiment group at the end of the fourth, eighth and twelfth weeks were 
lower than those of the control group, and the difference was statistically 
significant, which indicated that the score reduction in the experiment group 
was larger than that in the control group. The SAS and SDS scores of the 
experiment group at these time points were not significantly different from 
those of the control group, which indicated that these two treatment methods 
were comparable in treating patients' anxiety and depression.
CONCLUSION: The CBT intervention using WeChat may improve the subjectively 
reported severity of alcohol dependence of patients who had completed 
detoxification. It is conducive to prevention of relapse, and is convenient for 
patients. It is worthy of clinical application and further study.

BACKGROUND: Studies of Internet-delivered psychotherapies suggest that clients 
report development of a therapeutic alliance in the Internet environment. 
Because a majority of the interventions studied to date have been 
therapist-assisted to some degree, it remains unclear whether a therapeutic 
alliance can develop within the context of an Internet-delivered self-guided 
intervention with no therapist support, and whether this has consequences for 
program outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study reports findings of a secondary analysis of data from 90 
participants with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety, and/or stress who used a 
fully automated mobile phone and Web-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) 
intervention called "myCompass" in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: Symptoms, functioning, and positive well-being were assessed at 
baseline and post-intervention using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 
(DASS), the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the Mental Health 
Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Therapeutic alliance was measured at 
post-intervention using the Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM), and this was 
supplemented with qualitative data obtained from 16 participant interviews. 
Extent of participant engagement with the program was also assessed.
RESULTS: Mean ratings on the ARM subscales were above the neutral midpoints, and 
the interviewees provided rich detail of a meaningful and collaborative 
therapeutic relationship with the myCompass program. Whereas scores on the ARM 
subscales did not correlate with treatment outcomes, participants' ratings of 
the quality of their emotional connection with the program correlated 
significantly and positively with program logins, frequency of self-monitoring, 
and number of treatment modules completed (r values between .32-.38, P≤.002). 
The alliance (ARM) subscales measuring perceived empowerment (r=.26, P=.02) and 
perceived freedom to self-disclose (r=.25, P=.04) also correlated significantly 
in a positive direction with self-monitoring frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and qualitative findings from this analysis showed 
that a positive therapeutic alliance can develop in the Internet environment in 
the absence of therapist support, and that components of the alliance may have 
implications for program usage. Further investigation of alliance features in 
the Internet environment and the consequences of these for treatment outcomes 
and user engagement is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Maternal history of trauma is a risk factor for distress during 
pregnancy. The purpose of this paper was to examine the theorized differential 
impact of a cognitive behavioral intervention (Mothers and Babies Personalized; 
MB-P) on maternal distress and emotional regulation for those with ≥ 1 adverse 
childhood experiences (ACEs; vs no ACEs) from pregnancy to 3 months postpartum.
METHODS: Between August 2019 and August 2021, eligible pregnant individuals aged 
≥ 18 years, < 22 weeks' gestation, and English-speaking were recruited from 6 
university-affiliated prenatal clinics. Participants (N = 100) were randomized 
to MB-P (n = 49) or control (n = 51). Analyzable data were collected for 95 
participants. Analyses tested progression of change (slope) and at individual 
timepoints (panel analysis) for perinatal mental health outcomes.
RESULTS: The majority of participants (n = 68, 71%) reported experiencing > 1 
ACE (median = 1, range: 0-11). Participants demonstrated significant 
differential effects for depressive symptoms in absence of ACEs (standardized 
mean differences [SMD] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.13-1.51]) vs in 
presence of ACEs (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI = [-0.20 to 0.97]) and perceived stress in 
absence of ACEs (SMD = 0.92; 95% CI = [0.23-1.62]) vs in presence of ACEs (SMD = 
-0.05; 95% CI = [-0.63 to 0.53]). A panel analysis showed significantly reduced 
depressive symptoms postintervention and increased negative mood regulation at 3 
months postpartum for individuals with ACEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings support effectiveness of the MB-P intervention to reduce 
prenatal distress for all pregnant individuals. Preliminary exploration suggests 
the possibility that individuals with ACEs may benefit from enhanced 
trauma-informed content to optimize the effects of a perinatal intervention.

BACKGROUND: Mass outbreaks such as pandemics are associated with mental health 
problems requiring effective psychological interventions. Although several forms 
of psychological interventions may be advocated or used, some may lack strong 
evidence of efficacy and some may not have been evaluated in mass infectious 
disease outbreaks. This paper reports a systematic review of published studies 
(PROSPERO CRD:42020182094. Registered: 24.04.2020) examining the types and 
effectiveness of psychological support interventions for the general population 
and healthcare workers exposed to mass infectious disease outbreaks.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) 
were identified through searches of electronic databases: Medline (Ovid), Embase 
(Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCO) and the Cochrane Library Database from inception to 
06.05.2021 using an agreed search strategy. Studies were included if they 
assessed the effectiveness of interventions providing psychological support to 
the general population and / or healthcare workers exposed to mass infectious 
disease outbreaks. Studies were excluded if they focused on man-made or natural 
disasters or if they included armed forces, police, fire-fighters or 
coastguards.
RESULTS: Twenty-two RCTs were included after screening. Various psychological 
interventions have been used: therapist-guided therapy (n = 1); online 
counselling (n = 1); 'Emotional Freedom Techniques' (n = 1); mobile phone apps 
(n = 2); brief crisis intervention (n = 1); psychological-behavioural 
intervention (n = 1); Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (n = 3); progressive muscle 
relaxation (n = 2); emotional-based directed drawing (n = 1); psycho-educational 
debriefing (n = 1); guided imagery (n = 1); Eye Movement Desensitization and 
Reprocessing (EMDR) (n = 1); expressive writing (n = 2); tailored intervention 
for patients with a chronic medical conditions (n = 1); community health workers 
(n = 1); self-guided psychological intervention (n = 1), and a digital behaviour 
change intervention (n = 1). Meta-analyses showed that psychological 
interventions had a statistically significant benefit in managing depression 
(Standardised Mean Difference [SMD]: -0.40; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: - 0.76 
to - 0.03), and anxiety (SMD: -0.72; 95% CI: - 1.03 to - 0.40). The effect on 
stress was equivocal (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI: - 0.19 to 0.51). The heterogeneity of 
studies, studies' high risk of bias, and the lack of available evidence means 
uncertainty remains.
CONCLUSIONS: Further RCTs and intervention studies involving representative 
study populations are needed to inform the development of targeted and tailored 
psychological interventions for those exposed to mass infectious disease 
outbreaks.

BACKGROUND: Bereavement due to cancer increases the risk of prolonged grief 
disorder. However, specialized treatment options for prolonged grief after a 
loss due to illness are still scarce.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to extend previous findings by evaluating a 
web-based cognitive behavioral intervention with asynchronous therapist support, 
consisting of structured writing tasks adapted specifically for prolonged grief 
after cancer bereavement.
METHODS: The intervention was evaluated in a purely web-based randomized 
waitlist-controlled trial. Open-access recruitment of participants was conducted 
on the web. Prolonged grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression, 
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, somatization, sleep 
quality, and mental and physical health were assessed on the web via validated 
self-report measures.
RESULTS: A total of 87 participants were randomized into the intervention group 
(IG; 44/87, 51%) or the waitlist control group (43/87, 49%). Of the 
participants, 7% (6/87) dropped out of the study (5/44, 11%, in the IG). Of the 
39 completers in the IG, 37 (95%) completed all intervention tasks. The 
intervention reduced symptoms of prolonged grief (intention-to-treat: P<.001; 
η2=0.34; Cohen d=0.80) to a clinically significant extent. It had favorable 
effects on depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and 
overall mental health but not on somatization, sleep quality, or physical 
health.
CONCLUSIONS: The web-based intervention for prolonged grief after cancer 
bereavement is effective in reducing symptoms of prolonged grief disorder and 
accompanying syndromes in a timely, easily realizable manner and addresses 
specific challenges of bereavement to illness. Considering web-based approaches 
in future mental health care policy and practice can reduce health care gaps for 
those who are bereaved to cancer.

AIMS: To compare and rank the efficacy of different non-pharmacological 
interventions on anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and the quality of life 
in liver transplantation patients.
BACKGROUND: In recent years, numerous non-pharmacological interventions have 
been developed to address anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and the quality 
of life in liver transplantation patients. However, it remains unclear which 
non-pharmacological intervention serves as the most effective and preferred 
approach.
DESIGN: A systematic review and network meta-analysis in accordance with the 
PRISMA guidelines.
METHODS: Relevant randomised controlled trials were extracted from eight 
electronic databases. A network meta-analysis was then performed to evaluate the 
relative efficacy of the non-pharmacological interventions for liver 
transplantation patients. The quality of the data was assessed using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We registered this study in PROSPERO, number 
CRD42023450346.
RESULTS: A total of 25 randomised controlled trials were included. Spouse 
support education combined with mindfulness training, individualised 
psychological intervention, and cognitive behavioural therapy were found to be 
significantly effective for both anxiety and depression. The top three 
interventions against anxiety were spouse support education combined with 
mindfulness training, individualised psychological intervention, and exercise 
rehabilitation training. Meanwhile, individualised psychological intervention, 
spouse support education combined with mindfulness training, and cognitive 
behavioural therapy were the top-ranked three interventions for reducing 
depression. Sleep hygiene education was the most effective to improve sleep 
disorders. Continuous care based on a mobile medical platform emerged as the 
most effective intervention in improving the quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Several non-pharmacological interventions appeared to be effective 
in treating anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and improving the quality of 
life among liver transplantation patients. More high-quality clinical trials 
should be incorporated in the future to investigate the reliability of existing 
findings.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to 
apply these promising non-pharmacological interventions during clinical care.

Young people (YP) (between 10 and 24 years) are disproportionally vulnerable to 
developing and being affected by mental health conditions due to physical, 
social and emotional risk factors. YP in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
have poorer access to, and quality of, mental health services compared to those 
in high-income countries. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been 
proposed as tools to address this burden of disease and reduce the global 
treatment gap in youth mental health outcomes. This study aimed to examine the 
evidence for DMHIs for treating mental disorders in YP based in LMICs. To do 
this, the author searched academic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Web 
of Science) for primary studies on DMHIs targeting YP in LMICs. Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria were followed. 
The quality of the studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills 
Programme) framework. A narrative synthesis methodology was used to summarise 
and explain the findings. The authors identified 287 studies of which 7 were 
eligible in the final review. The authors found evidence of the effectiveness of 
multiple forms of DMHI (especially internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy) 
on anxiety and depression outcomes. Studies reported a lack of long-term 
benefits of treatment, high dropout rates, and did not include key geographical 
settings or data on cost-effectiveness. No studies were judged to be of high 
quality. This review highlights the available evidence showing that DMHIs can 
improve mental health outcomes for YP in LMICs, but due to the limited number of 
studies and lack of high-quality data, increased adoption and scaling up of 
digital interventions require more rigorous studies showing clinical 
effectiveness and ability to provide return on investment.

BACKGROUND: As the use of guided digitally-delivered cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (GdCBT) grows, pragmatic analytic tools are needed to evaluate coaches' 
implementation fidelity.
AIMS: We evaluated how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning 
(ML) methods might automate the monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity 
to GdCBT delivered as part of a randomized controlled trial.
METHOD: Coaches served as guides to 6-month GdCBT with 3,381 assigned users with 
or at risk for anxiety, depression, or eating disorders. CBT-trained and 
supervised human coders used a rubric to rate the implementation fidelity of 
13,529 coach-to-user messages. NLP methods abstracted data from text-based 
coach-to-user messages, and 11 ML models predicting coach implementation 
fidelity were evaluated.
RESULTS: Inter-rater agreement by human coders was excellent (intra-class 
correlation coefficient = .980-.992). Coaches achieved behavioral targets at the 
start of the GdCBT and maintained strong fidelity throughout most subsequent 
messages. Coaches also avoided prohibited actions (e.g. reinforcing users' 
avoidance). Sentiment analyses generally indicated a higher frequency of 
coach-delivered positive than negative sentiment words and predicted coach 
implementation fidelity with acceptable performance metrics (e.g. area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 74.48%). The final 
best-performing ML algorithms that included a more comprehensive set of NLP 
features performed well (e.g. AUC = 76.06%).
CONCLUSIONS: NLP and ML tools could help clinical supervisors automate 
monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT. These tools could 
maximize allocation of scarce resources by reducing the personnel time needed to 
measure fidelity, potentially freeing up more time for high-quality clinical 
care.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent, often comorbid disorder associated with 
difficulties sleeping, remaining awake, and impaired quality of life. 
Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (ICBT-I) has the 
potential to help large numbers of people with sleep disorders. This study 
investigated the preliminary effects of an 8-week guided ICBT-I intervention 
within a routine stepped-care service. Fifty-six (N = 56) patients consented to 
participate. The primary outcome was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI) and secondary outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire 
9-item (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the Work and 
Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), each administered at baseline and weekly 
thereafter. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that ICBT-I produced 
statistically significant pre- to post- reductions in symptoms of insomnia, 
yielding within-group effects of d = 0.82 suggesting a potential for improved 
outcomes. Similar improvements were seen across secondary outcomes, with 
small-to-medium post-treatment within-group effects observed: depression 
(d = 0.63), anxiety (d = 0.39), and functional impairment (d = 0.31). These 
findings are supportive of the intervention's potential effectiveness and speak 
to the importance of several implementation factors that could enhance the 
effects of the intervention. The results contribute to the growing evidence base 
for digital interventions designed to help those with sleep difficulties and 
will inform the design of a future controlled evaluation of ICBT-I under routine 
clinical settings.

OBJECTIVE: Computerised therapies play an integral role in efforts to improve 
access to psychological treatment for patients with depression and anxiety. 
However, despite recognised problems with uptake, there has been a lack of 
investigation into the barriers and facilitators of engagement. We aimed to 
systematically review and synthesise findings from qualitative studies of 
computerised therapies, in order to identify factors impacting on engagement.
METHOD: Systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies of user 
experiences of computer delivered therapy for depression and/or anxiety.
RESULTS: 8 studies were included in the review. All except one were of desktop 
based cognitive behavioural treatments. Black and minority ethnic and older 
participants were underrepresented, and only one study addressed users with a 
co-morbid physical health problem. Through synthesis, we identified two key 
overarching concepts, regarding the need for treatments to be sensitive to the 
individual, and the dialectal nature of user experience, with different degrees 
of support and anonymity experienced as both positive and negative. We propose 
that these factors can be conceptually understood as the 'non-specific' or 
'common' factors of computerised therapy, analogous to but distinct from the 
common factors of traditional face-to-face therapies.
CONCLUSION: Experience of computerised therapy could be improved through 
personalisation and sensitisation of content to individual users, recognising 
the need for users to experience a sense of 'self' in the treatment which is 
currently absent. Exploiting the common factors of computerised therapy, through 
enhancing perceived connection and collaboration, could offer a way of 
reconciling tensions due to the dialectal nature of user experience. Future 
research should explore whether the findings are generalisable to other patient 
groups, to other delivery formats (such as mobile technology) and other 
treatment modalities beyond cognitive behaviour therapy. The proposed model 
could aid the development of enhancements to current packages to improve uptake 
and support engagement.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of relationship status on levels of stress, 
anxiety, and depression during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to identify 
relationship status groups who are at greater risk of mental health 
difficulties.
METHODS: The sample was drawn from individuals who subscribed to the Text4Hope 
program, a cognitive behavioral therapy inspired text messaging service 
developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey link was 
sent to the subscribers to ascertain their relationship status and assess 
psychopathology using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9). Data analysis was carried out using SPSS-26 for descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Within the first 6 weeks of the pandemic, 8267 of 44·992 subscribers 
responded to the online survey giving a response rate of 19.4%. Mean scores on 
the PSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 were highest among those who were single and lowest 
among those who were widowed. Overall, mean scores on the PHQ-9 were higher in 
groups who self-identified as separated or divorced when compared with groups 
who identified as having partners, including the categories of married or 
cohabiting.
CONCLUSIONS: Relationship status during the COVID-19 pandemic has an influence 
on the mental health of individuals. Our findings highlight relationship groups 
at risk of mental health problems during the pandemic and for whom treatments 
and mitigation should be targeted.

Strengths use, the engagement of positive character traits in everyday contexts, 
is associated with both positive functioning and symptom reduction. The present 
study examined longitudinal relationships between strengths use and emotional 
disorder symptoms (anxiety, stress, and depression) during a randomized clinical 
trial of the Digital Unified Protocol, a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral 
therapy. Participants (N = 120) completed assessments at four major time points 
during treatment and at 3-month follow-up. We specified three random-intercept 
cross-lagged panel model to capture within-person, bidirectional, time-lagged 
relationships between strengths use and anxiety, stress, and depression, 
respectively. Prospective increases in strengths use were associated with 
significant decreases in anxiety at all time points (β = -0.26 to -0.49), while 
prospective decreases in anxiety were associated with significant increases in 
strengths use at most time points (β = -0.25 to -0.36). Prospective increases in 
strengths use were associated with significant decreases in stress at most time 
points (β = -0.23 to -0.54), while prospective decreases in stress were 
associated with significant increases in strengths use at Week 4 (β = -0.21) and 
at follow-up (β = -0.41). Prospective increases in strengths use were associated 
with significant decreases in depression at Week 8 (β = -0.63) and at 
posttreatment (β = -0.67), while prospective decreases in depression were 
associated with significant increases in strengths use at most time points (β = 
-0.34 to -0.47). Clinical implications of findings are discussed, including the 
potential role of strengths use as a treatment target. (PsycInfo Database Record

OBJECTIVE: Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) may provide an 
accessible alternative to face-to-face treatment, but the evidence base in 
adolescents is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to 
comprehensively assess the efficacy of ICBT in addressing depression among 
adolescents.
METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched on June 8, 2023. Randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of ICBT for depression in 
adolescents were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the 
risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook. Furthermore, the GRADE 
approach was employed to gauge the certainty of the obtained evidence. 
Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4, and Egger's test was implemented 
through Stata for assessment of potential publication bias.
RESULTS: A total of 18 RCTs involving 1683 patients were included. In comparison 
to control groups like attention control, waiting list, and treatment as usual, 
our meta-analysis findings elucidate a significant reduction in depression 
scores (SMD = -0.42, 95 % CI: [-0.74, -0.11], p < .05) as well as anxiety scores 
(SMD = -0.34, 95 % CI: [-0.60, -0.08], p < .05) in adolescents following ICBT 
interventions. Furthermore, the analysis indicated no notable distinctions in 
patient's quality of life (QoL) scores. (SMD = 0.12, 95 % CI: [-0.10, 0.34], 
p > .05).
CONCLUSION: Results provide evidence of the efficacy of ICBT to reduce 
depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. These research findings are of 
vital significance for the establishment of evidence-based treatment guidelines 
in the digital era.

Background: Dyssynergic defecation (DD) is a major cause of chronic functional 
constipation. Patients with DD have greater psychological distress and impaired 
health-related quality of life compared with the general population. This study 
aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
combined with biofeedback therapy (BFT) on the quality of life, anxiety, 
depression and physical symptoms in patients with DD. Methods: This randomized 
controlled trial (IRCT20141115019957N2) was conducted on 45DD patients who were 
referred to the Rehabilitation Clinic of Iran University of Medical Sciences in 
2017. The convenience sampling method was used to select the participants and 
then they were randomly allocated into three equal groups using RANDBETWEEN 
function in Excel. The first group received a combination of BFT&CBT and also 
standard-of-care therapy (SoCT). The second group was treated with BFT and SoCT, 
and the third group received only SoCT. The patients were assessed by digital 
rectal examination and the Short Form-36, Spielberger Anxiety, Beck Depression 
and Constipation Scoring System questionnaires before and after the 
treatment.The data were analyzed by SPSS-22, ANOVA, ANCOVA and Chi-Square tests. 
Results: Patients who received both CBT&BFT had significant improvement in 
symptoms of constipation, depression, and anxiety.Furthermore, BFT and CBT&BFT 
groups are valued equivalent only on the mental component of SF36 and the total 
SF36 questionnaire. But the physical component was significantly different, 
favoring CBT&BFT (p< 0.001). In CBT&BFT group,67%of patients reached the relaxed 
stage. In contrast, no patient reached the relaxed neither in BFT nor in SoCT. 
Conclusion: According to our study, patients with unfavorable responses to BFT 
may become better if CBT is added to their treatment plan.

Perfectionism is a transdiagnostic process associated with multiple mental 
health disorders. Perfectionism can moderate the effectiveness of Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for depression, but it remains unclear whether 
perfectionism is associated with CBT outcomes for anxiety disorders. This study 
investigated the relationship between perfectionism, treatment outcomes and 
adherence for individuals seeking internet-based CBT (iCBT) for Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD). A total of 1,904 adults from the general Australian 
community commenced an iCBT GAD program and completed measures of perfectionism, 
generalised anxiety, depression and psychological distress at baseline, 
mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Regression analyses were used to examine 
relationships between baseline perfectionism, post-treatment symptom reductions 
and treatment completion. Baseline perfectionism was significantly associated 
with pre-treatment GAD symptom severity, but not treatment completion or 
reductions in GAD severity post-iCBT. Significant reductions in generalised 
anxiety symptom severity (Hedges' g = 1.32), depression symptoms (g = 0.97), 
distress (g = 1.34) and perfectionism (both striving and evaluative concerns, 
g = 0.49 and g = 0.37, respectively) were observed with treatment. These 
findings suggest that iCBT for GAD is effective in reducing perfectionism, 
despite not directly targeting this process. Given there was no significant 
relationship between baseline perfectionism and treatment outcomes, it may not 
be necessary to specifically target perfectionism when delivering iCBT for GAD.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is common in adolescents. This study evaluated feasibility 
and preliminary efficacy of a six-week internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (ICBT-I) in adolescents.
METHODS: In this uncontrolled pilot study, participants (n = 27, 78% female) 
completed assessments pre- and post intervention. Data on recruitment, adherence 
to treatment, treatment activity, satisfaction and credibility was collected to 
assess feasibility. Self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep parameters as well as 
depression, anxiety and daytime function were also assessed.
RESULTS: Participants showed good adherence to treatment and found the 
intervention overall credible and satisfactory. From pre- to post-assessment, 
statistically significant improvements were found for insomnia symptoms (p < 
.001; d = 1.02), sleep onset latency (p < .001; d = .39), wake after sleep onset 
(p = .001; d = .34), sleep efficiency (p < .001; d = .5) and depression (p = 
.01, d = .37). Changes in scores of total sleep time, generalized anxiety, 
daytime sleepiness and functional disability were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that ICBT-I is well accepted by 
adolescents, that insomnia symptoms and sleep parameters can improve following 
the intervention, and that co-morbid symptoms of depression can be reduced. Due 
to the limited sample size and the uncontrolled design, the suggested results 
need to be replicated in well-powered controlled clinical trials.

PURPOSE: Given the stigma surrounding mental health, a discussion of how 
symptoms interfere with sleep might be a useful first step to identify unhelpful 
thoughts or feelings of distress. We asked: 1) Does sleep quality have an 
association with magnitude of incapability and pain intensity independent of 
mental health? and 2) Are mental health factors associated with sleep quality?
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of one hundred and fifty-four 
patients seeking musculoskeletal care who completed measures of magnitude of 
capability, pain intensity, unhelpful thoughts regarding symptoms (catastrophic 
thinking, negative pain thoughts), distress (symptoms of anxiety and 
depression), and sleep disturbance. We tested factors associated with the 
magnitude of capability and pain intensity, accounting for sleep quality and 
mental health in multivariable models.
RESULTS: Accounting for potential confounding in multivariable analysis, lower 
magnitude of capability was independently associated with greater sleep 
disturbance, more unhelpful thoughts about symptoms (negative pain thoughts), 
and older age. Greater pain intensity was independently associated with greater 
unhelpful thoughts about symptoms (catastrophic thinking) and not using of an 
electronic device before bed. Greater sleep disturbance was independently 
associated with use of sleep medication, greater symptoms of anxiety, and 
greater unhelpful thoughts regarding symptoms (PCS).
CONCLUSION: Given the observation that sleep disturbance is associated with 
feelings of anxiety, clinicians can consider starting mental health discussions 
by focusing on sleep quality. App and web-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy-based treatments for sleep are readily available and have the potential 
to improve mental health.

BACKGROUND: Blended treatments, combining digital components with face-to-face 
(FTF) therapy, are starting to find their way into mental health care. Knowledge 
on how blended treatments should be set up is, however, still limited. To 
further explore and optimize blended treatment protocols, it is important to 
obtain a full picture of what actually happens during treatments when applied in 
routine mental health care.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to gain insight into the usage of the 
different components of a blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) for 
depression and reflect on actual engagement as compared with intended 
application, compare bCBT usage between primary and specialized care, and 
explore different usage patterns.
METHODS: Data used were collected from participants of the European Comparative 
Effectiveness Research on Internet-Based Depression Treatment project, a 
European multisite randomized controlled trial comparing bCBT with regular care 
for depression. Patients were recruited in primary and specialized routine 
mental health care settings between February 2015 and December 2017. Analyses 
were performed on the group of participants allocated to the bCBT condition who 
made use of the Moodbuster platform and for whom data from all blended 
components were available (n=200). Included patients were from Germany, Poland, 
the Netherlands, and France; 64.5% (129/200) were female and the average age was 
42 years (range 18-74 years).
RESULTS: Overall, there was a large variability in the usage of the blended 
treatment. A clear distinction between care settings was observed, with longer 
treatment duration and more FTF sessions in specialized care and a more active 
and intensive usage of the Web-based component by the patients in primary care. 
Of the patients who started the bCBT, 89.5% (179/200) also continued with this 
treatment format. Treatment preference, educational level, and the number of 
comorbid disorders were associated with bCBT engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: Blended treatments can be applied to a group of patients being 
treated for depression in routine mental health care. Rather than striving for 
an optimal blend, a more personalized blended care approach seems to be the most 
suitable. The next step is to gain more insight into the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of blended treatments and to further facilitate uptake in 
routine mental health care.

BACKGROUND: People with alcohol and substance use disorders (SUDs) often have 
underlying difficulties in regulating emotions. Although dialectical behavioral 
therapy is effective for SUDs, it is often difficult to access. Self-guided, 
internet-delivered dialectical behavioral therapy (iDBT) allows for expanded 
availability, but few studies have rigorously evaluated it in individuals with 
SUDs.
OBJECTIVE: This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and potential 
efficacy of an iDBT intervention in treatment-seeking adults with SUDs. We 
hypothesized that iDBT would be feasible, credible, acceptable, and engaging to 
people with SUDs. We also hypothesized that the immediate versus delayed iDBT 
group would show comparatively greater improvements and that both groups would 
show significant improvements over time.
METHODS: A 12-week, single-blinded, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial 
was implemented, with assessments at baseline and at 4 (acute), 8, and 12 weeks 
(follow-up). A total of 72 community adults aged 18 to 64 years were randomized. 
The immediate group (n=38) received access to iDBT at baseline, and the delayed 
group (n=34) received access after 4 weeks. The intervention (Pocket Skills 2.0) 
was a self-guided iDBT via a website, with immediate access to all content, 
additional text and email reminders, and additional support meetings as 
requested. Our primary outcome was substance dependence, with secondary outcomes 
pertaining to feasibility, clinical outcomes, functional disability, and emotion 
dysregulation, among other measures. All outcomes were assessed using 
self-report questionnaires.
RESULTS: iDBT was perceived as a credible and acceptable treatment. In terms of 
feasibility, 94% (68/72) of the participants started iDBT, 13% (9/68) were early 
dropouts, 35% (24/68) used it for the recommended 8 days in the first month, and 
50% (34/68) were still active 4 weeks later. On average, the participants used 
iDBT for 2 hours and 24 minutes across 10 separate days. In the acute period, no 
greater benefit was found for the immediate group on substance dependence, 
although we did find lower depression (b=-2.46; P=.02) and anxiety (b=-2.22; 
P=.02). At follow-up, there were greater benefits in terms of reduced alcohol 
(b=-2.00; P=.02) and nonalcoholic substance (b=-3.74; P=.01) consumption in the 
immediate access group. Both groups demonstrated improvements in substance 
dependence in the acute (b=-1.73; P<.001) and follow-up period (b=-2.09; 
P<.001). At follow-up, both groups reported reduced depression, anxiety, 
suicidal behaviors, emotional dysregulation, and functional disability.
CONCLUSIONS: iDBT is a feasible and acceptable intervention for patients with 
SUDs, although methods for improving engagement are warranted. Although results 
did not support efficacy for the primary outcome at 4 weeks, findings support 
reductions in substance dependence and other mental health concerns at 12 weeks. 
Notwithstanding the limitations of this study, the results suggest the potential 
value of iDBT in the treatment of SUDs and other mental health conditions.

Introduction: Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring are rapidly growing 
fields. This scoping review provides an update on remote patient monitoring for 
neuropsychiatric disorders from recent publications and upcoming clinical 
trials. Methods: Publications (PubMed and ICHUSHI; published January 2010 to 
February 2021) and trials (ClinicalTrials.gov and Japanese registries; active or 
recruiting by March 2021) that assessed wearable devices for remote management 
and/or monitoring of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders were searched. The 
review focuses on disorders with ≥3 publications. Results: We identified 44 
publications and 51 active or recruiting trials, mostly from 2019 or 2020. 
Research on digital devices was most common for Parkinson's disease (11 
publications and 19 trials), primarily for monitoring motor symptoms and/or 
preventing falls. Other disorders (3-5 publications each) included epilepsy 
(electroencephalogram [EEG] and seizure prediction), sleep disorder (sleep 
outcomes and behavioral therapies), multiple sclerosis (physical activity and 
symptoms), depression (physical activity, symptoms, and behavioral therapies), 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (symptoms). Very few studies focused on newly 
emerging technologies (e.g., in-ear EEG and portable oximeters), and few studies 
integrated remote symptom monitoring with telemedicine. Discussion: Currently, 
development of digital devices for daily symptom monitoring is focused on 
Parkinson's disease. For the diseases reviewed, studies mostly focused on 
physical activity rather than psychiatric or nonmotor symptoms. Although the 
validity and usefulness of many devices are established, models for implementing 
remote patient monitoring in telehealth settings have not been established. 
Conclusions: Verification of the clinical effectiveness of digital devices 
combined with telemedicine is needed to further advance remote patient care for 
neuropsychiatric disorders.

Elbow musculoskeletal pain (EP) is a major cause of disability. 
Telerehabilitation has shown great potential in mitigating musculoskeletal pain 
conditions, but EP is less explored. This single-arm interventional study 
investigates clinical outcomes and engagement levels of a completely remote 
multimodal digital care program (DCP) in patients with EP. The DCP consisted of 
exercise, education, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for 8 weeks. Primary 
outcome: disability change (through the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, 
and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), treatment response cut-offs: 12.0-point 
reduction and 30% change). Secondary outcomes: pain, analgesic intake, surgery 
intent, mental health, fear-avoidance beliefs, work productivity, and patient 
engagement. Of the 132 individuals that started the DCP, 112 (84.8%) completed 
the intervention. Significant improvements were observed in QuickDASH with an 
average reduction of 48.7% (11.9, 95% CI 9.8; 14.0), with 75.3% of participants 
reporting ≥30% change and 47.7% reporting ≥12.0 points. Disability change was 
accompanied by reductions in pain (53.1%), surgery intent (57.5%), anxiety 
(59.8%), depression (68.9%), fear-avoidance beliefs (34.2%), and productivity 
impairment (72.3%). Engagement (3.5 (SD 1.4) sessions per week) and satisfaction 
8.5/10 (SD 1.6) were high. The significant improvement observed in clinical 
outcomes, alongside high engagement, and satisfaction suggests patient 
acceptance of this care delivery mode.

This study aims to explore the factors that affect the prognosis of patients 
with insomnia who are treated with mobile cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients 
with insomnia who visited the sleep disorders clinic were selected and completed 
mobile Cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients completed at least three 
evaluations (including baseline, monthly evaluations thereafter, and a final 
evaluation at the end of one year) and responded well to treatment within one 
year of follow-up. Insomnia, anxiety, and depression symptoms were evaluated 
using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9), respectively. Treatment prognosis including relapse, recurrence, and 
remission group. These 339 patients were divided into three groups: 160 patients 
who remission, 100 patients who relapsed, and 79 patients who experienced 
recurrence after remission. Demographic characteristics of the 339 patients 
showed no significant difference in gender between the three groups (P = 0.978). 
However, significant differences were found in age (P = 0.006) and onset time 
(P = 0.000) among the three groups. The remission group had a higher average age 
than the recurrence group and the relapse group, and the onset time was slower 
than the other two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
age and delayed onset time were protective factors for good treatment prognosis, 
while low educational level and high GAD-7 scores were independent risk factors 
for poor prognosis. There are many factors that affect the treatment prognosis 
of insomnia. Age, low educational level, high GAD-7 scores, and delayed onset 
time can be used to predict the prognosis of insomnia treatment.

PURPOSE: Insomnia is highly prevalent among cancer survivors and can have 
serious implications if inadequately treated. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
Insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia but is 
rarely available to cancer survivors. We tested the effectiveness of a web-based 
CBT-I program, OncoSleep, in cancer survivors.
METHODS: Cancer survivors with insomnia (n = 154) were randomly assigned (1:1) 
to digital CBT-I (6 weekly self-guided modules plus online clinician support) or 
a waitlist control group. Patient-reported outcome measures of insomnia severity 
(primary outcome), daytime functioning, and sleep diaries were administered 
online at baseline and post-treatment (8 weeks). Intention-to-treat analyses 
were performed using mixed-effects models. Statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: The treatment group reported an average 11.0-point reduction in the 
Insomnia Severity index (ISI), compared to a 1.4-point reduction in the control 
group (p<.001). Statistically significant group-by-time interactions were 
observed: web-based CBT-I produced significant, large effects for improvements 
in insomnia severity (d = -2.56), cognitive functioning (d = 0.95), physical 
(d = 1.24) and psychological quality of life (d = 0.80), and fatigue 
(d = -1.35). Small-to-large effect sizes were found for reductions in anxiety 
(d = -0.77), depression (d = -0.71), and pain (d = -0.40). Change in insomnia 
severity mediated the effect of digital CBT-I on daytime outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based CBT-I with clinician support appears to be an effective 
treatment for insomnia in cancer survivors, offering meaningful benefits for 
comorbid symptoms and quality of life. Further studies with active comparisons 
and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings. Digital CBT-I 
could be integrated into cancer rehabilitation programs to reduce the burden of 
insomnia. [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04898855].

Impact of an Online Discussion Forum on Self-Guided Internet-Delivered Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy for Public Safety Personnel: Randomized Trial.

BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is an 
effective and accessible treatment for various mental health concerns. ICBT has 
shown promising treatment outcomes among public safety personnel (PSP), who 
experience high rates of mental health problems and face barriers to accessing 
other mental health services. Client engagement and clinical outcomes are better 
in ICBT with therapist guidance, but ICBT is easier to implement on a large 
scale when it is self-guided. Therefore, it is important to identify strategies 
to improve outcomes and engagement in self-guided ICBT and other self-guided 
digital mental health interventions. One such strategy is the use of online 
discussion forums to provide ICBT clients with opportunities for mutual social 
support. Self-guided interventions accompanied by online discussion forums have 
shown excellent treatment outcomes, but there is a need for research 
experimentally testing the impact of online discussion forums in ICBT.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate a transdiagnostic, self-guided ICBT intervention 
tailored specifically for PSP (which had not previously been assessed), assess 
the impact of adding a therapist-moderated online discussion forum on outcomes, 
and analyze participants' feedback to inform future research and implementation 
efforts.
METHODS: In this randomized trial, we randomly assigned participating PSP 
(N=107) to access an 8-week transdiagnostic, self-guided ICBT course with or 
without a built-in online discussion forum. Enrollment and participation were 
entirely web-based. We assessed changes in depression, anxiety, and 
posttraumatic stress as well as several secondary outcome measures (eg, 
treatment engagement and satisfaction) using questionnaires at the 
pre-enrollment, 8-week postenrollment, and 20-week postenrollment time points. 
Mixed methods analyses included multilevel modeling and qualitative content 
analysis.
RESULTS: Participants engaged minimally with the forum, creating 9 posts. There 
were no differences in treatment outcomes between participants who were randomly 
assigned to access the forum (56/107, 52.3%) and those who were not (51/107, 
47.7%). Across conditions, participants who reported clinically significant 
symptoms during enrollment showed large and statistically significant reductions 
in symptoms (P<.05 and d>0.97 in all cases). Participants also showed good 
treatment engagement and satisfaction, with 43% (46/107) of participants fully 
completing the intervention during the course of the study and 96% (79/82) 
indicating that the intervention was worth their time.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has shown excellent clinical outcomes for 
self-guided ICBT accompanied by discussion forums and good engagement with those 
forums. Although clinical outcomes in our study were excellent across 
conditions, engagement with the forum was poor, in contrast to previous 
research. We discuss several possible interpretations of this finding (eg, 
related to the population under study or the design of the forum). Our findings 
highlight a need for more research evaluating the impact of online discussion 
forums and other strategies for improving outcomes and engagement in self-guided 
ICBT and other digital mental health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) can help bridge the gap 
between the demand for mental health care and availability of treatment 
resources. The affordances of DMHIs have been proposed to overcome barriers to 
care such as accessibility, cost, and stigma. Despite these proposals, most 
evaluations of the DMHI focus on clinical effectiveness, with less consideration 
of users' perspectives and experiences.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of "Overcoming 
Thoughts," a web-based platform that uses cognitive and behavioral principles to 
address depression and anxiety. The "Overcoming Thoughts" platform included 2 
brief interventions-cognitive restructuring and behavioral experimentation. 
Users accessed either a version that included asynchronous interactions with 
other users ("crowdsourced" platform) or a completely self-guided version 
(control condition). We aimed to understand the users' perspectives and 
experiences by conducting a subset of interviews during the follow-up period of 
the trial.
METHODS: We used purposive sampling to select a subset of trial participants 
based on group assignment (treatment and control) and symptom improvement (those 
who improved and those who did not on primary outcomes). We conducted 
semistructured interviews with 23 participants during the follow-up period that 
addressed acceptability, usability, and impact. We conducted a thematic analysis 
of the interviews until saturation was reached.
RESULTS: A total of 8 major themes were identified: possible opportunities to 
expand the platform; improvements in mental health because of using the 
platform; increased self-reflection skills; platform being more helpful for 
certain situations or domains; implementation of skills into users' lives, even 
without direct platform use; increased coping skills because of using the 
platform; repetitiveness of platform exercises; and use pattern. Although no 
differences in themes were found among groups based on improvement status (all P 
values >.05, ranging from .12 to .86), there were 4 themes that differed based 
on conditions (P values from .01 to .046): helpfulness of self-reflection 
supported by an exercise summary (greater in control); aiding in slowing 
thoughts and feeling calmer (greater in control); overcoming patterns of 
avoidance (greater in control); and repetitiveness of content (greater in the 
intervention).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the different benefits that users perceived from a 
novel DMHI and opportunities to improve the platform. Interestingly, we did not 
note any differences in themes between those who improved and those who did not, 
but we did find some differences between those who received the control and 
intervention versions of the platform. Future research should continue to 
investigate users' experiences with DMHIs to better understand the complex 
dynamics of their use and outcomes.

PURPOSE: Following major lower extremity amputation (LEA), patients experience 
significant emotional distress and are at risk for anxiety and depression. There 
is a lack of mental health supports for this population, and internet-based 
cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) may be a useful resource to meet this need. 
The purpose of this study was to use a qualitative approach to explore the 
mental health needs of LEA patients and to gauge their attitudes of the use of 
iCBT to help them cope with their amputation.
METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with inpatients 
and outpatients with LEA recruited from a major urban rehabilitation hospital. 
Data were analysed using inductive codebook thematic analysis (TA).
RESULTS: Ten interviews were completed with individuals with LEA. The main 
themes identified were: (1) Fixating on the past; (2) Worry about the future; 
(3) Unmet mental health needs; (4) Barriers to Mental Health Support; (5) 
Importance of peer support; and (6) Tailoring iCBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that patients with LEA are open to learning 
more about iCBT to meet their mental health needs. Key iCBT implementation 
considerations include taking into account issues of stigma associated with 
mental health, timing of delivery, levels of digital literacy, online security, 
and interactive content.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONFollowing lower extremity 
amputation (LEA), people experience significant emotional distress and are at 
risk for the development of anxiety and/or depression.Patients with LEA are 
receptive to an online mental health resource (i.e., internet-based cognitive 
behavioural therapy [iCBT]) but it needs to be tailored to meet the various 
mental health needs and digital literacy of the LEA population.The use of an 
implementation science approach can help identify factors related to the 
development and potential uptake of an iCBT for patients with LEA.

INTRODUCTION: Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health disorders 
worldwide. Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) can reduce 
barriers to care to broad cross sections of the population. However, People of 
Diverse Ethnocultural Backgrounds (PDEGs) other than White/Caucasian 
underutilize mental health services and are under represented in clinical trials 
of psychological interventions.
METHODS: To address this research gap we adapted an evidence-based ICBT program 
for PDEGs. The current pilot study explores the engagement, satisfaction, and 
effectiveness in the adapted ICBT program by PDEGs (N=41) when benchmarked 
against a sample of PDEGs (N=134) who previously completed a non-adapted version 
of the ICBT program.
RESULTS: An intent-to-treat analyses showed that the adapted ICBT program is 
effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms among PDEGs. Large 
within-group pre-to post-treatment Cohen's effect sizes of d = 1.23, 95% CI 
[0.68, 1.77] and d = 1.24, 95% CI [0.69, 1.79] were found for depression and 
anxiety, respectively. Further, 81.8% of the PDEGs who received the adapted ICBT 
reported overall satisfaction, 90.9% reported increased confidence in managing 
symptoms, and 70.7% completed majority of the psychoeducational lessons in the 
ICBT program.
CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes, 
engagement, and satisfaction were found between the pilot study and benchmark 
sample. Future directions for ICBT research with PDEGs are described.

Healthy development is likely to occur when an adolescent's risk factors are 
limited and when protective factors are fostered. Healthy development is further 
encouraged when youth feel valued, empowered, and form healthy social 
connections. Threats to the well-being of adolescents typically result from 
experimentation and psychosocial stressors. SSHADESS (strengths, school, home, 
activities, drugs, emotions/eating, sexuality, safety) is a mnemonic to 
facilitate collection of psychosocial history of critical life dimensions 
emphasizing strengths within a youth's life experience instead of solely 
focusing on risks, which in isolation can provoke feelings of shame. Because 
adolescents are more likely to access health care and share sensitive 
information when confidentiality is assured, clinicians should regularly offer 
confidential screening and counseling. When limited for time, a brief 
psychosocial screen may include current stressors, availability of a confidant, 
and school or work experience as a proxy for well-being. Clinicians should 
provide education to prevent initiation of tobacco use. Long-acting reversible 
contraceptives are safe and effective in adolescents and should be offered as 
first-line options to prevent pregnancy. Sexually active females 24 years or 
younger should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia annually. Adolescents 12 
years or older should be screened for major depressive disorder when systems are 
available to ensure accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Adolescents 
with body mass index at the 95th percentile or higher should be referred for 
comprehensive behavioral interventions. Seatbelt use and avoidance of distracted 
or impaired driving should be discussed. Clinicians should discuss digital 
literacy and appropriate online boundary setting and display of personal 
information.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the impact of digital cognitive 
behavioral therapy (dCBT) for insomnia on both self-reported cognitive 
impairment and objective cognitive performance.
METHODS: The Defining the Impact of Sleep improvement on Cognitive Outcomes 
(DISCO) trial was an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomized clinical trial of 
dCBT versus wait-list control. Participants were aged 25 years and older, met 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, and reported difficulties with 
concentration or memory. Assessments were carried out online at baseline, and 10 
and 24 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome measure was self-reported 
cognitive impairment, assessed with the British Columbia Cognitive Complaints 
Inventory (BC-CCI). Secondary outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, 
insomnia symptoms, cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and 
anxiety.
RESULTS: Four hundred and ten participants with insomnia were recruited and 
assigned to dCBT (N = 205) or wait-list control (N = 205). At 10 weeks 
post-randomization the estimated adjusted mean difference for the BC-CCI was 
-3.03 (95% CI: -3.60, -2.47; p < 0.0001, d = -0.86), indicating that 
participants in the dCBT group reported less cognitive impairment than the 
control group. These effects were maintained at 24 weeks (d = -0.96) and were 
mediated, in part, via reductions in insomnia severity and increased sleep 
efficiency. Treatment effects in favor of dCBT, at both 10 and 24 weeks, were 
found for insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, cognitive failures, fatigue, 
sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. We found no between-group differences in 
objective tests of cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that dCBT robustly decreases self-reported 
cognitive impairment at post-treatment and these effects are maintained at 6 
months.

In treating depression and anxiety, just over half of all clients respond. 
Monitoring and obtaining early client feedback can allow for rapidly adapted 
treatment delivery and improve outcomes. This study seeks to develop a 
state-of-the-art deep-learning framework for predicting clinical outcomes in 
internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) by leveraging 
large-scale, high-dimensional time-series data of client-reported mental health 
symptoms and platform interaction data. We use de-identified data from 45,876 
clients on SilverCloud Health, a digital platform for the psychological 
treatment of depression and anxiety. We train deep recurrent neural network 
(RNN) models to predict whether a client will show reliable improvement by the 
end of treatment using clinical measures, interaction data with the iCBT 
program, or both. Outcomes are based on total improvement in symptoms of 
depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), as reported within the iCBT program. Using internal 
and external datasets, we compare the proposed models against several benchmarks 
and rigorously evaluate them according to their predictive accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity and AUROC over treatment. Our proposed RNN models 
consistently predict reliable improvement in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, using past 
clinical measures alone, with above 87% accuracy and 0.89 AUROC after three or 
more review periods, outperforming all benchmark models. Additional evaluations 
demonstrate the robustness of the achieved models across (i) different health 
services; (ii) geographic locations; (iii) iCBT programs, and (iv) client 
severity subgroups. Results demonstrate the robust performance of dynamic 
prediction models that can yield clinically helpful prognostic information ready 
for implementation within iCBT systems to support timely decision-making and 
treatment adjustments by iCBT clinical supporters towards improved client 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is associated with significant psychological distress, 
including fear of progression (FoP). Because insomnia and depression are highly 
prevalent and associated with FoP, we examined the association between FoP, 
insomnia, and depression in cancer patients. Furthermore, we tested the 
mediation effect of cancer-related dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (C-DBS) on 
this association.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected from patients with surgically resected 
non-small cell lung cancer from a single-center randomized controlled study 
investigating digital healthcare applications. Baseline demographic and clinical 
variables were collected. In addition, self-reported questionnaires including 
the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form, Patients Health 
Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index, and C-DBS were 
administered.
RESULTS: Among the 320 enrolled patients with lung cancer, a regression model 
showed that FoP was predicted by age (β = -0.13, P = 0.007), PHQ-9 (β = 0.35, P 
< 0.001), and C-DBS (β = 0.28, P < 0.001). Insomnia did not directly influence 
FoP, but C-DBS mediated the association. Depression directly influenced FoP, but 
C-DBS did not mediate this association.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with surgically resected lung cancer, C-DBS mediated 
the effects of severity of insomnia on FoP. Depression directly influenced FoP, 
but C-DBS did not influence this association. To reduce FoP among patients with 
lung cancer, C-DBS should be addressed in the cognitive behavioral therapy 
module.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of online remote behavior 
therapy, compared with face-to-face therapy in reducing tics and co-occurring 
disorders associated with the tics in a sample of youths with Tourette Syndrome.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. TS patients were randomized to receive 
face-to-face or online remote behavior therapy.
PARTICIPANTS: 40 children aged between 9 and 16 years affected by Tourette 
Syndrome.
RESULTS: Online remote and face-to-face behavior therapy are equally effective 
in the treatment of tics and co-occurring disorders in children and adolescents 
affected by Tourette Syndrome. Both groups showed an improvement in the severity 
of tics, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, as assessed by 
neuropsychological findings. Online remote behavior therapy was more effective 
for reducing depressive symptoms than face-to-face behavior therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Online remote behavior therapy is a promising tool for behavioral 
therapies for patients with Tourette Syndrome and may represents an alternative 
treatment option.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are a leading cause of disability worldwide 
and often start during adolescence and young adulthood. The majority of young 
people live in low- and middle-income countries where there is a lack of mental 
health services. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guided, 
nonartificial intelligence chatbot intervention called Scalable Technology for 
Adolescents and youth to Reduce Stress (STARS) to reduce symptoms of depression 
and anxiety among young people affected by adversity.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the 
STARS intervention and study procedures among young people in Jordan.
METHODS: A 2-arm, single-blind, feasibility randomized controlled trial was 
conducted among 60 young people aged 18 years to 21 years living in Jordan with 
self-reported elevated levels of psychological distress. Immediately after 
baseline, participants were randomized 1:1 into the STARS intervention or 
enhanced care as usual (ECAU). STARS consisted of 10 lessons in which 
participants interacted with a chatbot and learned several cognitive behavioral 
therapy strategies, with optional guidance by a trained e-helper through 5 
weekly phone calls. ECAU consisted of a static web page providing basic 
psychoeducation. Online questionnaires were administered at baseline (week 0) 
and postassessment (week 8) to assess depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 
[HSCL-25]), anxiety (HSCL-25), functional impairment (WHO Disability Assessment 
Schedule [WHODAS] 2.0), psychological well-being (WHO-Five Well-Being Index 
[WHO-5]), and agency (State Hope Scale). Process evaluation interviews with 
stakeholders were conducted after the postassessment.
RESULTS: Participants were recruited in December 2022 and January 2023. Of 700 
screening website visits, 160 participants were eligible, and 60 participants 
(mean age 19.7, SD 1.16 years; 49/60, 82% female) continued to baseline and were 
randomized into STARS (n=30) or ECAU (n=30). Of those who received STARS, 37% 
(11/30) completed at least 8 chatbot lessons, and 13% (4/30) completed all 5 
support calls. The research protocol functioned well in terms of balanced 
randomization, high retention at postassessment (48/60, 80%), and good 
psychometric properties of the online questionnaires. Process evaluation 
interviews with STARS participants, ECAU participants, e-helpers, and the 
clinical supervisor indicated the acceptability of the study procedures and the 
STARS and ECAU conditions and highlighted several aspects that could be 
improved, including the e-helper support and features of the STARS chatbot.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the 
STARS intervention and research procedures. A fully powered, definitive 
randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of 
STARS.

BACKGROUND: Young people with type 1 diabetes experience elevated levels of 
emotional distress that impact negatively on their diabetes self-care, quality 
of life, and disease-related morbidity and mortality. While the need is great 
and clinically significant, a range of structural (eg, service availability), 
psychological (eg, perceived stigma), and practical (eg, time and lifestyle) 
barriers mean that a majority of young people do not access the support they 
need to manage the emotional and behavioral challenges of type 1 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a 
fully-automated cognitive behavior therapy-based mobile phone and Web-based 
psychotherapeutic intervention (myCompass) for reducing mental health symptoms 
and diabetes-related distress, and improving positive well-being in this 
vulnerable patient group.
METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Young people 
with type 1 diabetes and at least mild psychological distress will be recruited 
via outpatient diabetes centers at three tertiary hospitals in Sydney, 
Australia, and referred for screening to a study-specific website. Data will be 
collected entirely online. Participants randomized to the intervention group 
will use the myCompass intervention for 7 weeks, while at the same time a 
control group will use an active placebo program matched to the intervention on 
duration, mode of delivery, and interactivity.
RESULTS: The primary outcome will be mental well-being (ie, depression, anxiety, 
diabetes-related distress, and positive well-being), for which data will be 
collected at baseline, post-intervention, and after 3 months follow-up. 
Secondary outcomes will be functional (work and social functioning and diabetes 
self-care), biochemical measures (HbA1c), and mental health self-efficacy. We 
aim to recruit 280 people into the study that will be conducted entirely online. 
Group differences will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed 
models repeated measures.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that scores on the outcome measures will improve 
significantly for young people who use the mobile phone and Web-based 
intervention compared to the control group. myCompass is a public health 
intervention that is broadly available and free to use. If effective, the 
program has the capacity to provide convenient and accessible evidenced-based 
care to the large group of young people with type 1 diabetes who do not 
currently access the psychosocial support they need.

BACKGROUND: Children whose parents have alcohol use problems are at an increased 
risk of several negative consequences, such as poor school performance, an 
earlier onset of substance use, and poor mental health. Many would benefit from 
support programs, but the figures reveal that only a small proportion is reached 
by existing support. Digital interventions can provide readily accessible 
support and potentially reach a large number of children. Research on digital 
interventions aimed at this target group is scarce. We have developed a novel 
digital therapist-assisted self-management intervention targeting adolescents 
whose parents had alcohol use problems. This program aims to strengthen coping 
behaviors, improve mental health, and decrease alcohol consumption in 
adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a novel web-based 
therapist-assisted self-management intervention for adolescents whose parents 
have alcohol use problems.
METHODS: Participants were recruited on the internet from social media and 
websites containing health-related information about adolescents. Possible 
participants were screened using the short version of the Children of Alcoholics 
Screening Test-6. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to either the 
intervention group (n=101) or the waitlist control group (n=103), and they were 
unblinded to the condition. The assessments, all self-assessed, consisted of a 
baseline and 2 follow-ups after 2 and 6 months. The primary outcome was the 
Coping With Parents Abuse Questionnaire (CPAQ), and secondary outcomes were the 
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Alcohol Use Disorders 
Identification Test (AUDIT-C), and Ladder of Life (LoL).
RESULTS: For the primary outcome, CPAQ, a small but inconclusive treatment 
effect was observed (Cohen d=-0.05 at both follow-up time points). The 
intervention group scored 38% and 46% lower than the control group on the 
continuous part of the AUDIT-C at the 2- and 6-month follow-up, respectively. 
All other between-group comparisons were inconclusive at either follow-up time 
point. Adherence was low, as only 24% (24/101) of the participants in the 
intervention group completed the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings were inconclusive for the primary outcome but 
demonstrate that a digital therapist-assisted self-management intervention may 
contribute to a reduction in alcohol consumption. These results highlight the 
potential for digital interventions to reach a vulnerable, hard-to-reach group 
of adolescents but underscore the need to develop more engaging support 
interventions to increase adherence.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive restructuring (CR) is an evidence-based psychological 
technique for depression. However, face-to-face CR is not easily accessible. 
Digital CR interventions often overlook the difficulties individuals 
experiencing depression encounter in identifying their negative automatic 
thoughts (NAT), leading to suboptimal outcomes. Virtual Reality (VR) has 
potential advantages in assisting the identification of NAT in CR intervention.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this preliminary feasibility study is to assess the 
efficacy, acceptability and safety of a VR-based self-guided training on the 
identification of negative automatic thoughts (VR-STINAT) for depression, as 
well as to evaluate the user experience.
METHODS: In a mixed methods study, 20 healthy participants underwent VR-STINAT 
and completed a semi-structured interview, followed by post-training homework. 
The VR-STINAT includes three modules: psychological education, NAT 
identification training in VR scenarios, and practice in personally experienced 
scenarios. Effectiveness was measured via Thought Record Skills Assessment 
(TRSA) of homework and Cognitive Therapy Awareness Scale (CTAS). Acceptability 
was measured using an adapted Technology Acceptance Model and duration of 
training. Safety was measured via Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and 
self-reported negative emotions. Qualitative material was analyzed using 
thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The VR-STINAT was acceptable, with an average rating of 80.68%. The 
accuracy of NAT identification in TRSA reached 84.55%, and CTAS correctness 
reached 76.67%. The majority of participants experienced minimal or no side 
effects, although a few (10%, 2/20) reported relatively severe fatigue and 
craniofacial pain. Thematic analysis reviewed four themes: effectiveness, 
acceptability, advantages of VR, difficulties in use and suggestions for 
improvement. Most participants indicated that they've learned how to identify 
their NAT through VR-STINAT (85%, 17/20), which was engaging (90%, 18/20) and 
easy to use (60%, 12/20).
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that self-guided training 
for the identification of negative automatic thoughts related to depression 
using VR is feasible. Future studies are needed to compare the efficacy of VR 
with other intervention modalities in people with depression.

BACKGROUND: Only a relatively low proportion of university students seek help 
for anxiety and depression disorders, partly because they dislike current drug 
and psychological treatment options and would prefer home-based care. The aim of 
this study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and cost utility of 
Alpha-Stim cranial electrostimulation (CES) delivered through a nurse led 
primary care clinic as a daily treatment for anxiety and depression symptoms by 
the student at home in contrast to usual primary care.
METHOD: Feasibility and acceptability of a nurse led clinic offering Alpha-Stim 
CES in terms of the take up and completion of the six-week course of Alpha-Stim 
CES. Change in score on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 as measures of anxiety and 
depression symptoms at baseline and at 8 weeks following a course of Alpha-Stim 
CES. Similar evaluation in a non-randomised control group attending a family 
doctor over the same period. Cost-utility analysis of the nurse led Alpha-Stim 
CES and family doctor pathways with participants failing to improve following 
further NICE Guideline clinical care (facilitated self-help and cognitive 
behaviour therapy).
RESULTS: Of 47 students (mean age 22.1, years, 79% female opting for Alpha-Stim 
CES at the nurse-led clinic 46 (97.9%) completed a 6-week daily course. 
Forty-seven (47) students comprised a comparison group receiving usual family 
doctor care. Both Alpha-Stim CES and usual family doctor care were associated 
with large effect size reductions in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores from baseline to 
8 weeks. There were no adverse effects and only one participant showed a 
clinically important deterioration in the Alpha-Stim group. In the cost utility 
analysis, Alpha-Stim CES was a cheaper option than usual family doctor care 
under all deterministic or probabilistic assumptions.
CONCLUSION: Nurse delivered Alpha-Stim CES may be a feasible, acceptable and 
cheaper way of providing greater choice and home-based care for some university 
students seeking help from primary care with new presentations of anxiety and 
depression.

BACKGROUND: A serious game called SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, 
X-factor thoughts), originally developed in New Zealand and incorporating 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles, has been shown to help reduce 
symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents with mild to moderate 
depression in studies undertaken in Australasia. However, SPARX has never been 
trialled in the United Kingdom (UK), and there have been issues relating to low 
engagement when it has been used in a real-world context.
AIMS: To conduct the first pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial 
(RCT) in England to explore the use of SPARX in different settings. The trial 
will explore whether SPARX supported by an e-coach (assistant psychologists) 
improves adherence and engagement compared with self-directed (i.e. self-help) 
use. The trial results will be used to inform the optimal mode of delivery 
(SPARX supported vs. SPARX self-directed), to calculate an appropriate sample 
size for a full RCT, and to decide which setting is most suitable.
METHODS: Following consultation with young people to ensure study 
suitability/appropriateness, a total of 120 adolescents (11-19 years) will be 
recruited for this three-arm study. Adolescents recruited for the study across 
England will be randomised to receive either SPARX with human support (from an 
e-coach), self-directed SPARX, or a waitlist control group. Assessments will be 
conducted online at baseline, week 4, and 8-10-week post-randomisation. The 
assessments will include measures which capture demographic, depression (Patient 
Health Questionnaire modified for adolescents [PHQ-A]) and anxiety (Revised 
Child Anxiety and Depression Scale [RCADS]) symptomatology, and health-related 
quality-of-life data (EQ-5D-Y and proxy version). Analyses will be primarily 
descriptive. Qualitative interviews will be undertaken with a proportion of the 
participants and clinical staff as part of a process evaluation, and the 
qualitative data gathered will be thematically analysed. Finally, feasibility 
data will be collected on recruitment details, overall study uptake and 
engagement with SPARX, participant retention, and youth-reported acceptability 
of the intervention.
DISCUSSION: The findings will inform the design of a future definitive RCT of 
SPARX in the UK. If the subsequent definitive RCT demonstrates that SPARX is 
effective, then an online serious game utilising CBT principles ultimately has 
the potential to improve the provision of care within the UK's health services 
if delivered en masse.

This commentary examines publicly available information on 2017-2018 outcomes in 
the UK government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) 
programme, a National Health Service (NHS) primary care mental health programme 
in England. In that year there were 1.4 million referrals into IAPT and over 
500,000 people completed a course of treatment. The IAPT database collects 
routine session-by-session outcome monitoring data for this population, 
including outcomes for depression and anxiety in a stepped care model which 
includes a range of psychological therapies, among them Cognitive Behavioural 
Therapy (CBT) and Person-centred Experiential Therapy, known in the IAPT 
programme as Counselling for Depression (CfD).In 2017-18, 32% of all referrals 
were for anxiety and stress disorders, 26% for depression, and 35% were 
unspecified. The definition of treatment completion is receipt of 2 sessions or 
more and on this basis 60% of all referrals in 2017-18 did not complete 
treatment, predominantly because they failed to attend the initial appointment, 
or ended after only one session. Four years of data on outcomes for CBT and CfD 
suggests these therapies are broadly comparable in terms of both recovery rate 
and average number of sessions, though the number of referrals to each therapy 
varied widely. Data on treatment choice and satisfaction was favourable but 
there were issues with low return rates and invalid data. Information on 
outcomes for ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and religion, as well as 
a measure of local economic deprivation, indicate lower outcomes for a number of 
patient groups. Data on employment status outcomes suggest little overall 
change, including for the category of those on benefits payments.The data 
published alongside the annual IAPT reports mean there is an increasing amount 
of information in the public domain about IAPT performance, but it is time 
consuming to extract and evaluate. This report highlights a number of points of 
concern which suggest the need for improvement on multiple axes. We suggest that 
improved researcher access to the huge IAPT dataset can allow for more detailed 
evaluations of IAPT that can inform policy/decision-making to improve outcomes 
for clients.

OBJECTIVE: Mental health complaints are prevalent among people with epilepsy, 
yet there are major barriers that prevent access to psychological care, 
including high out-of-pocket costs and a lack of accessible specialized 
services. The purpose of the current study is to examine the comparative 
efficacy, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of a digital 
psychological intervention when delivered under two models of care (i.e., guided 
vs. unguided) in supporting the mental health and functioning of adults with 
epilepsy.
METHOD: Approximately 375 participants across Australia will be enrolled. 
Eligible participants will have a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, experience 
difficulties with their emotional health, be at least 18 years of age, and live 
in Australia. Participants will be randomized (2:2:1) to receive the Wellbeing 
Neuro Course, a 10-week internet-delivered program, with (i.e., guided) or 
without guidance by a mental health clinician (i.e., unguided), or be allocated 
to a treatment-as-usual waiting-list control group. Participants will complete 
online questionnaires at pre-, post-treatment, and 3- and 12-month follow-up and 
consent to have their data linked to their medical records to capture healthcare 
system resource use and costs.
ANALYSIS: Primary outcome measures will be symptoms of depression and anxiety. A 
cost-utility analysis will be undertaken using the Australian healthcare system 
perspective and according to current economic evaluation guidelines. Resource 
use and costs to the healthcare system during the study period will be captured 
via data linkage to relevant administrative datasets in Australia.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this trial will provide important data concerning 
the relative outcomes of these different models of care and will inform the 
integration of digital psychological interventions translation into healthcare 
services.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of Macquarie 
University approved the proposed study (Reference No: 520231325151475). The 
results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication(s).
ANZCTR TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12623001327673.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study seeks to find out if a 10-week online 
psychological treatment can improve the mental health and well-being of 
Australian adults with epilepsy. Around 375 participants will be randomly 
assigned to different groups: one will receive treatment with guidance from 
mental health clinician (guided group), one without guidance (unguided group), 
and one starting later (waiting control group). All participants will fill out 
the same outcome measures online. The main goal of this research is to compare 
these groups and assess how well the treatment works in improving mental health 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Drug misuse is complex, and various treatment modalities are 
emerging. Providing supportive text messages to individuals with substance use 
disorder offers the prospect of managing and improving symptoms of drug misuse 
and associated comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the impact of the daily supportive text message 
program (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) in mitigating cravings and mental health 
symptoms in subscribers and quantify user satisfaction with the 
Text4Hope-Addiction Support program.
METHODS: Subscribers to the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program received daily 
supportive text messages for 3 months; the messages were crafted based on 
addiction counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy principles. Participants 
completed an anonymous web-based questionnaire to assess cravings, anxiety, and 
depressive symptoms using the Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS), Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) 
scale at enrollment (baseline), after 6 weeks, and after 3 months. Likert scale 
satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the 
Text4Hope-Addiction program.
RESULTS: In total, 408 people subscribed to the program, and 110 of 408 (26.9%) 
subscribers completed the surveys at least at one time point. There were 
significant differences between the mean baseline and 3-month BSCS scores P=.01 
(-2.17, 95% CI -0.62 to 3.72), PHQ-9 scores, P=.004 (-5.08, 95% CI -1.65 to 
-8.51), and GAD-7 scores, P=.02 (-3.02, 95% CI -0.48 to -5.56). Participants who 
received the supportive text messages reported a reduced desire to use drugs and 
a longer time interval between substance use, which are reflected in 41.1% and 
32.5% decrease, respectively, from baseline score. Approximately 89% (23/26) of 
the participants agreed that Text4Hope-Addiction program helped them cope with 
addiction-related stress, and 81% (21/25) of the participants reported that the 
messages assisted them in dealing with anxiety. Overall, 69% (18/26) of the 
participants agreed that it helped them cope with depression related to 
addiction; 85% (22/26) of the participants felt connected to a support system; 
77% (20/26) of the participants were hopeful of their ability to manage 
addiction issues; and 73% (19/26) of the participants felt that their overall 
mental well-being was improved. Most of the participants agreed that the 
interventions were always positive and affirmative (19/26, 73%), and succinct 
(17/26, 65%). Furthermore, 88% (21/24) of the participants always read the 
messages; 83% (20/24) of the participants took positive or beneficial actions 
after reading; and no participant took a negative action after reading the 
messages. In addition, most participants agreed to recommend other diverse 
technology-based services as an adjunctive treatment for their mental and 
physical health disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Subscribers of Text4Hope-Addiction Support program experienced 
improved mental health and addiction symptoms. Addiction care practitioners and 
policy makers can implement supportive text-based strategies to complement 
conventional treatments for addiction, given that mobile devices are widely 
used.

This manuscript presents the protocol and participatory planning process for 
implementing the Community Resilience Learning Collaborative and Research 
Network (C-LEARN) study. C-LEARN is designed to determine how to build a service 
program and individual client capacity to improve mental health-related quality 
of life among individuals at risk for depression, with exposure to social risk 
factors or concerns about environmental hazards in areas of Southern Louisiana 
at risk for events such as hurricanes and storms. The study uses a Community 
Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR) framework to incorporate community 
priorities into study design and implementation. The first phase of C-LEARN is 
assessment of community priorities, assets, and opportunities for building 
resilience through key informant interviews and community agency outreach. 
Findings from this phase will inform the implementation of a two-level 
(program-level and individual client level) randomized study in up to four South 
Louisiana communities. Within communities, health and social-community service 
programs will be randomized to Community Engagement and Planning (CEP) for 
multi-sector coalition support or Technical Assistance (TA) for individual 
program support to implement evidence-based and community-prioritized 
intervention toolkits, including an expanded version of depression collaborative 
care and resources (referrals, manuals) to address social risk factors such as 
financial or housing instability and for a community resilience approach to 
disaster preparedness and response. Within each arm, the study will randomize 
individual adult clients to one of two mobile applications that provide 
informational resources on services for depression, social risk factors, and 
disaster response or also provide psychoeducation on Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy to enhance coping with stress and mood. Planned data collection includes 
baseline, six-month and brief monthly surveys for clients, and baseline and 
12-month surveys for administrators and staff.

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was reported to 
have increased depression among university students which was associated with 
impairments in their campus lives. This study examined changes in depressive 
states among Japanese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A secondary data analysis from a factorial randomized controlled trial 
involving smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy was performed. Six 
cohorts (N = 1626) underwent an 8-week intervention during the spring or autumn 
of 2019-2021, with a 9-month follow-up. We evaluated participants' depressive 
states weekly using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the 
intervention, with monthly evaluations thereafter. The follow-up periods 
included Japan's four states of emergency (SOEs) to control COVID-19. 
Hypothesizing that SOEs caused a sudden worsening of depressive states, Study 1 
compared the cohorts' PHQ-9 scores, and Study 2 employed time series analysis 
with a mixed-effects model to estimate identified changes in PHQ-9 scores.
RESULTS: Although no changes in depressive states were observed in relation to 
the SOEs, Study 1 identified sudden increases in PHQ-9 scores at the 28-week 
evaluation point, which corresponded to the beginning of the new academic year 
for the three autumn cohorts. In contrast, the three spring cohorts did not 
exhibit similar changes. Study 2 showed that, for all three autumn cohorts 
(n = 522), the 0.60-point change was significant (95% CI 0.42-0.78; p < .001) at 
28 weeks; that is, when their timeline was interrupted.
CONCLUSIONS: While the results do not indicate any notable impact of the SOEs, 
they highlight the influence of the new academic year on university students' 
mental health during COVID-19. Trial registration UMIN, CTR-000031307.

Objectives: Numerous studies and reviews have explored the value of adding 
therapist support to internet self-help for improving client adherence and 
outcomes. This study is different as it explores the value of adding internet 
self-help to face-to-face therapy, from the perspective of practitioners who 
used both. This study explores practitioners' experiences of whether-and 
how-internet self-help blended with face-to-face therapy may confer an added 
value or become an added burden to their routine practice. Methods: Using a 
structured topic guide, we collected narrative data via 3 focus groups and 1 
telephone interview from 11 practitioners across two sites in England. We 
carried out a thematic analysis within two domains, "value vs. burden". Results: 
Practitioners reported that internet self-help can confer added value to 
face-to-face therapy by: fostering client engagement with face-to-face sessions; 
making therapy ubiquitous beyond sessions; and preventing therapeutic drift 
between sessions. Conversely, internet self-help can add burden to face-to-face 
therapy when it is experienced as disruptive, overwhelming and time-consuming. 
Conclusions: Recognizing and mitigating factors that can turn internet self-help 
from an added value to an added burden will help practitioners adopt and make 
the most out of blended therapy.

This review article is an overview of the effectiveness of internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. 
ICBT's effectiveness has been investigated in treating and managing conditions 
like depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive 
compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment 
disorder, bipolar disorder, chronic pain, and phobias. ICBT's role in the 
treatment of medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus with comorbid 
psychiatric illnesses was also explored. Furthermore, this study elaborates on 
its cost-effectiveness and its impact in rural areas. We conducted a thorough 
literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar with no restrictions on the 
date. ICBT's role in treating and controlling psychiatric illnesses has been 
established in the literature. From the data compiled, we conclude that ICBT is 
useful in treating mental health and medical illnesses with psychiatric 
comorbidities. It has also been found to be cost-effective for patients and 
society. ICBT is a potential tool emerging with modern day technological 
advancements and is useful in rural and urban settings, across various languages 
and cultures, and on a global scale. Larger randomized control trials on its use 
in clinical practice and in reaching rural populations are bound to shed more 
light on the effectiveness of this tool along with spreading awareness among 
physician and patient communities.

INTRODUCTION: Co-morbid anxiety and depression (distress) in inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) results in poorer outcomes and increased healthcare burden. IBD 
services require scalable treatment pathways for distress to meet this need. 
This real-world longitudinal study evaluates the implementation of a new 
integrated care pathway for distress including: 1) routine mental health 
screening and 2) therapist-guided, digital CBT tailored to the challenges of 
living with IBD (compass with adaptations for IBD: COMPASS-IBD) in a UK National 
Health Service (NHS) large gastroenterology service (∼ 5000 patients).
METHODS: We describe a mixed-methods, observational, real-world longitudinal 
study. Routine mental health screening in the IBD service will identify patients 
with distress (using pre-defined clinical cut-offs), who will be triaged to 
determine appropriate treatment pathways (including participation in the 
COMPASS-IBD study). Participants will receive COMPASS-IBD online for ∼12 weeks 
(including 6 × 30-min therapist sessions). Key implementation outcomes will 
assess reach and adoption of the new pathway using aggregate data on uptake of 
mental health screening, eligibility, and consent rates for COMPASS-IBD, and 
number of COMPASS-IBD sessions completed. Interviews with patients and 
healthcare providers will primarily assess acceptability of the new pathway. 
Potential effectiveness will be assessed using participant questionnaires at 
pre-intervention, 12-weeks (post-intervention), and 6-month follow-up. The 
primary effectiveness outcome will be pre-post changes in distress (PHQ-ADS 
scores). Quantitative data will be summarised using descriptive statistics and 
qualitative data analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
CONCLUSION: Study findings will inform treatment pathways for co-morbid distress 
in IBD, and highlight adaptations required to increase future scalability and 
effectiveness.

Military service members (SMs) and veterans who sustain mild traumatic brain 
injuries (mTBI) during combat deployments often have co-morbid conditions but 
are reluctant to seek out therapy in medical or mental health settings. 
Efficacious methods of intervention that are patient-centered and adaptable to a 
mobile and often difficult-to-reach population would be useful in improving 
quality of life. This article describes a new protocol developed as part of a 
randomized clinical trial of a telephone-mediated program for SMs with mTBI. The 
12-session program combines problem solving training (PST) with embedded modules 
targeting depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headache. The rationale and 
development of this behavioral intervention for implementation with persons with 
multiple co-morbidities is described along with the proposed analysis of 
results. In particular, we provide details regarding the creation of a treatment 
that is manualized yet flexible enough to address a wide variety of problems and 
symptoms within a standard framework. The methods involved in enrolling and 
retaining an often hard-to-study population are also highlighted.

BACKGROUND: Nonpharmacological management plays a key role in enhancing the 
quality of life for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), asthma, or both. However, disparities in their physical, mental, and 
health empowerment outcomes have not been fully explored, particularly in 
relation to the moderating effect of eHealth literacy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess these disparities and examine how eHealth 
literacy moderates them to guide the development of tailored nonpharmacological 
strategies.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 2 waves of the nationally representative 
"Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents" surveys to identify 
participants who self-reported asthma, COPD, or both. We assessed 5 physical 
outcomes (quality of life, physical activity, sleep quality, appetite, nicotine 
dependence), 4 mental outcomes (anxiety, depression, perceived stress, 
resilience), and 3 health empowerment measures (social support, self-efficacy, 
eHealth literacy). Multiple regression with Holm-Bonferroni corrections revealed 
health disparities and the moderation effect of eHealth literacy.
RESULTS: This unfunded study enrolled 1044 participants between June 2022 and 
August 2023, with data analysis completed within 7 months following data 
collection. The sample included 254 (24.3%) participants with asthma, 696 
(66.7%) participants with COPD, and 95 (9.1%) participants with both conditions. 
The mean age of the participants was 48.61 (SD 19.70) years, and 536 (51.3%) 
participants were male. Linear regression showed that individuals with both COPD 
and asthma had lower health-related quality of life and higher anxiety and 
depression compared with those with either condition alone (b ranges from -0.15 
to 3.35). This group also showed higher nicotine dependence than asthma-only 
(b=0.88) and lower resilience than COPD-only groups (b=-0.76) (all adjusted 
P<.05). eHealth literacy significantly moderated the effect of the disease group 
on all outcomes except physical activity (all adjusted P for interaction <.05). 
Nine disease pairs showed disparities in both eHealth literacy groups, 4 only in 
high literacy, and 8 only in low literacy (all P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with both COPD and asthma had poorer quality of life, 
greater anxiety and depression, higher nicotine dependence, and lower 
resilience, underscoring the need for integrated psychosocial and behavioral 
interventions. Although higher eHealth literacy was associated with improved 
quality of life, sleep quality, and resilience, it also widened disparities in 
anxiety and depression. Therefore, while enhancing eHealth literacy may help 
reduce overall health inequities among patients with chronic respiratory 
diseases, its potential adverse effects on mental well-being warrant careful 
attention. Moreover, lower eHealth literacy was linked to more pronounced 
disparities, indicating that outreach efforts and digital resources should be 
specifically designed to reach and empower vulnerable populations. Overall, our 
findings advocate for condition-specific, eHealth-enhanced care pathways that 
not only foster digital literacy but also integrate comprehensive mental health 
services, thereby mitigating health disparities among individuals with chronic 
respiratory diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can improve symptoms of anxiety 
and depression, but also reduces the risk of future relapse after therapy 
completion. However, current CBT relapse prevention methods are 
resource-intensive and can be limited in clinical practice. This paper 
investigates a personalized means of reducing relapse using smart-messaging in 
two settings: research and routine care.
DESIGN: Study 1 presents a cohort study comparing a cohort of smart-messaging 
users versus non-users. Study 2 presents time series follow-up data from a case 
series of smart-messaging users from clinical practice.
METHODS: Fifteen of 56 CBT completers who participated in a trial for the 
treatment of health anxiety wrote advice they would want if in future they were 
doing well, experiencing early warning signs of relapse, or experiencing full 
relapse. Following CBT, participants received weekly text-message requests to 
rate their well-being. Dependent upon their response, participants received 
tailored advice they had written, appropriate to the well-being level reported 
after recovery from health anxiety. Smart-messaging was also trialled in a 
routine practice sample of 14 CBT completers with anxiety and depression.
RESULTS: Across a 12-month follow-up, participants receiving smart-messaging 
showed greater health improvements than those who did not. Well-being scores 
showed stability between CBT completion and 6-month follow-up among routine care 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a low-intensity, personalized relapse 
prevention method can have a clinical benefit following CBT for common mental 
health problems.
PRACTITIONER POINTS: Post-treatment outcomes may be improved using personalized 
smart-messaging to prevent relapse following cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) 
for health anxiety. In clinical practice, post-treatment smart-messaging can be 
well-used by patients and may help maintain stable well-being in the 6 months 
after CBT ends. This evidence supports the clinical utility of a brief tailored 
digital intervention, which can be integrated within routine clinical practice 
with minimal therapist input. Overall, longer-term post-CBT outcomes may be 
improved by integrating a smart-messaging intervention at the end of therapy.

IMPORTANCE: Despite the prevalence and adverse consequences of prenatal 
insomnia, a paucity of research is available regarding interventions to improve 
insomnia symptoms during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for 
insomnia (CBT-I) compared with standard treatment among pregnant women with 
insomnia symptoms.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial enrolled 
pregnant women from November 23, 2016, to May 22, 2018. Of the 2258 women 
assessed for eligibility using an online self-report questionnaire, 208 were 
randomized to receive digital CBT-I (n = 105) or standard treatment (n = 103) 
for insomnia. Participants were pregnant up to 28 weeks' gestation, and they 
either had elevated insomnia symptom severity or met the criteria for insomnia 
caseness as determined by self-report questionnaires. Participants completed 
outcome measures at 10 weeks (postintervention) and 18 weeks (follow-up) after 
randomization. All study visits were completed remotely, and the intervention 
was delivered digitally. Data were analyzed between December 12, 2018, and July 
2, 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Digital CBT-I consisted of 6 weekly sessions of approximately 20 
minutes each. Standard treatment reflected standard care. Women receiving 
standard treatment had no limits placed on the receipt of nonstudy treatments, 
including medication and psychotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcomes were assessed remotely using 
self-report questionnaires administered via online survey. The primary outcome 
was the change in insomnia symptom severity (measured by the Insomnia Severity 
Index) from baseline to postintervention. Secondary outcomes were sleep 
efficiency and nightly sleep duration (defined by sleep diary), global sleep 
quality (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), depressive symptom 
severity (measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and anxiety 
symptom severity (measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7). For 
each outcome, we also examined the change from baseline to follow-up.
RESULTS: The 208 participants had a mean (SD) age of 33.6 (3.7) years and a mean 
(SD) gestational age of 17.6 (6.3) weeks at baseline. Most of the participants 
were white (138 [66.3%]), married or cohabiting (196 [94.2%]), had a college 
degree (180 [86.5%]), and earned $100 000 or more per year (141 [67.8%]). Women 
randomized to receive digital CBT-I experienced statistically significantly 
greater improvements in insomnia symptom severity from baseline to 
postintervention compared with women randomized to receive standard treatment 
(time-by-group interaction, difference = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.23; 
χ2 = 29.8; P < .001; d = -1.03). Improvements from baseline to postintervention 
for all secondary outcomes, with the exception of sleep duration, were 
statistically significant. A similar pattern of results was evident for the 
change from baseline to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this trial, digital CBT was an effective, 
scalable, safe, and acceptable intervention for improving insomnia symptoms 
during pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Sleep problems occur in many university students which affects their 
mental health and daily functioning. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) has been proven effective in adults but research in university students, 
who struggle to maintain a 24-hour rhythm, is still limited. We hypothesize that 
a guided digital CBT-I intervention, enriched with components on the biological 
clock ('i-Sleep & BioClock') will be effective in reducing insomnia severity and 
improving mental health outcomes for students with sleep problems.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a guided online sleep and 
biological clock self-help intervention in improving sleep, depression symptoms, 
anxiety symptoms, functioning, academic performance, and quality of life in 
university students at 6 weeks and 18 weeks.
METHODS: This is a two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled 
trial, comparing a 5-week guided online 'i-Sleep & BioClock' intervention to 
online psychoeducation (PE). We aim to include 192 university students 
(Bachelor, Master, and PhD) with at least subthreshold insomnia (Insomnia 
Severity Index ≥10), aged ≥16, who can speak Dutch or English. We are excluding 
students with current risk for suicide or night shifts. The primary outcome is 
insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes include sleep estimates (sleep and light 
exposure diary), depression, anxiety, functioning, quality of life, and academic 
performance. The effectiveness of the intervention compared to online PE will be 
evaluated using linear mixed models.
DISCUSSION: The current study tests the effectiveness of an online self-help 
intervention for university students who suffer from sleep problems. This trial 
builds upon an open feasibility study and will provide evidence of an online 
guided self-help program for students. The findings of this study will determine 
the potential wider dissemination of the intervention to address the high need 
for available and accessible help for students experiencing insomnia.

BACKGROUND: University students are at high risk of various mental health 
problems due to high levels of psychological distress. However, university 
counseling services are often inadequate to meet their mental health needs due 
to shortage of mental health professionals, especially in Hong Kong. 
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has shown similar effects as 
those of face-to-face CBT in addressing these mental health concerns, but few 
iCBT programs have been developed for Hong Kong university students.
OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to develop and evaluate a culturally and 
linguistically appropriate iCBT program called "REST Online" to reduce the 
psychological distress and improve the mental health of Chinese university 
students in Hong Kong in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHOD: The contents and functionality of the "REST Online" program which 
includes both web- and app-based versions, are described. A blended mode of 
service delivery is adopted, with 8 online modules and 2 counseling sessions. 
Therapist support will be provided by a CBT therapist. A total of 338 Chinese 
university students with mild to moderate levels of psychological distress will 
be openly recruited and randomized to three groups: the (1) web-based and (2) 
app-based "REST Online" groups, and (3) waitlist control group. The program 
effectiveness is evaluated in psychological distress, depression and anxiety 
symptoms, and positive and negative emotions and positive and negative thoughts 
at pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up tests. Linear mixed effect models will be 
conducted for data analysis.
DISCUSSION: The "REST Online" program is among the first of its kind to address 
the mental health needs of Hong Kong university students by an internet 
intervention. Theoretically, this study will provide some empirical evidence for 
the effectiveness of this iCBT program in the Hong Kong context for Chinese 
clients. Practically, if proven effective, this program can be provided to local 
university counselors as an option for service delivery. Strengths and 
limitations are also discussed.

Factors affecting suicidal ideation among premenopausal and postmenopausal 
women.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Pre- and postmenopausal women (PPW) experience 
changes in physical, psychological and social health. South-East Asia's female 
suicide rate is the highest compared with other countries, and the suicide rate 
of PPW in these countries continues to increase. The most influential factor in 
Asian women's suicidal ideation is family conflict; specifically, if PPW in 
South Korea cannot express their anger, it results in a culture-bound syndrome 
called "Hwa-Byung." However, there is a lack of research on Asian PPW. WHAT THE 
PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This study found differences in individual- 
and community-level factors affecting suicidal ideation between pre- and 
postmenopausal women. Individual factors that commonly affected suicidal 
ideation were experiencing violence, stress and depression. Individual factors 
that affected the suicidal ideation of premenopausal women more than 
postmenopausal women were religious beliefs, alcohol use and chronic disease. 
Community level factors affecting suicidal ideation were locational depression 
and locational counselling for stress in premenopausal women and locational 
counselling for depression in postmenopausal women. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS 
FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health nurses could help prevent suicide by developing and 
applying community-based programmes for PPW, considering the specific 
socio-economic and cultural context and characteristics of Asian women. Mental 
health nurses could help PPW participate in programmes by preparing various 
interventions such as case management, personal counselling, physical activity, 
home-based mental health services, cognitive behavioural therapy and digital 
interventions for self-management. Mental health nurses need to prepare various 
methods such as online, offline, individual and group methods to work 
effectively in any social situation. ABSTRACT: Introduction Pre- and 
postmenopausal women (PPW) experience physical and psychological changes with 
hormonal changes. Among Asian middle-aged women, family and culture affect 
suicidal ideation, and the suicide rate among this population is increasing. 
There are few existing research on suicidal ideation among Asian PPW. Aim We 
examined individual- and community-level factors that predict suicidal ideation 
among PPW. Method Large-scale panel data from 5,154 South Korean PPW aged 
35-64 years were used in a series of multilevel logistic regression analyses to 
examine factors associated with suicidal ideation at individual and community 
levels. Results Among premenopausal women, religious beliefs, alcohol use, 
chronic disease, experience of violence, stress and depression were 
individual-level factors. Locational depression and locational counselling for 
stress were community-level factors. Among postmenopausal women, experience of 
violence, stress, depression and perceived health status were individual level 
factors, and locational counselling for depression was a community level factor. 
Discussion Suicidal ideation among PPW is affected by both individual and 
community level factors. Nurses must comprehensively determine what risk factors 
affect suicidal ideation through various intervention methods-including online, 
offline, individual and group methods-while considering socio-economic 
situations. Implications for Practice Mental health nurses should provide 
targeted biopsychosocial interventions targeting psychosocial and physical 
problems and promoting the use of community resources to reduce PPW's suicidal 
ideation.

BACKGROUND: Online health interventions increase access to care, are acceptable 
to end users and effective for treating mental and physical health disorders. 
However, less is known about interventions to prevent and treat perinatal mood 
and anxiety disorders (PMADs). This review synthesizes existing research on PMAD 
prevention and treatment by exploring the treatment modalities and efficacy of 
online interventions and examining the inclusion of underserved populations in 
PMAD research.
METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, authors conducted a systematic review of 
peer-reviewed literature published between 2008 and 2018 on online interventions 
aimed to prevent or treat PMADs. The authors also assessed quality. Eligible 
articles included perinatal women participating in preventive studies or those 
aimed to reduce symptoms of PMADs and utilized a Web-based, Internet, or 
smartphone technology requiring an online component. This study excluded 
telephone-based interventions that required one-on-one conversations or 
individualized, text-based responses without a Web-based aspect.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 511 articles, and the final analysis 
included 23 articles reporting on 22 interventions. Most studies used an 
experimental design. However, no study achieved an excellent or good quality 
rating. Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) were most 
common. Several interventions using CBT strategies significantly decreased 
depression or anxiety. Four studies recruited and enrolled mainly people 
identifying as low-income or of a racial or ethnic minority group. Attrition was 
generally high across studies.
DISCUSSION: More research using rigorous study designs to test PMAD 
interventions across all perinatal times is needed. Future research needs to 
engage diverse populations purposefully.

BACKGROUND: Although exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety 
disorders has frequently been proven effective, only few studies examined 
whether it improves everyday behavioral outcomes such as social and physical 
activity.
METHODS: 126 participants (85 patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, social 
anxiety disorder, or specific phobias, and 41 controls without mental disorders) 
completed smartphone-based ambulatory ratings (activities, social interactions, 
mood, physical symptoms) and motion sensor-based indices of physical activity 
(steps, time spent moving, metabolic activity) at baseline, during, and after 
exposure-based treatment.
RESULTS: Prior to treatment, patients showed reduced mood and physical activity 
relative to healthy controls. Over the course of therapy, mood ratings, 
interactions with strangers and indices of physical activity improved, while 
reported physical symptoms decreased. Overall results did not differ between 
patients with primary panic disorder/agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder. 
Higher depression scores at baseline were associated with larger changes in 
reported symptoms and mood ratings, but smaller changes in physical activity 
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based treatment initiates increased physical activity, 
more frequent interaction with strangers, and improvements in everyday mood. The 
current approach provides objective and fine-graded process and outcome measures 
that may help to further improve treatments and possibly reduce relapse.

The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic placed a dramatic burden on managed healthcare and 
perhaps nowhere as evident as in neurological and psychiatric disease care. This 
said, the duration of the pandemic mandated adaptability of the entire care 
system and the oft-vaunted benefits of telehealth and telemedicine were 
subjected to deep scrutiny at scale. Positive experiences were reported by both 
patients and providers from routine check-ups, to use of cognitive behavioral 
therapy associated with mental disorders, and management of complex diseases 
such as multiple sclerosis and other neurological and psychiatric conditions. 
Integration into standard care looks likely in the post pandemic era with many 
healthcare systems moving to expand reimbursement categories and develop 
equitable incentive models for developers and providers. In this commentary we 
share perspective on how the future of care may evolve through hybrid delivery 
models, and the advent of new therapeutic approaches which can address pain 
points identified during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) is an 
efficacious, scalable intervention that could help meet the significant demand 
for psychological treatment. Yet, there is limited real-world evidence for its 
effectiveness. This study investigated the use and effectiveness of a free iCBT 
programme ('Just a Thought') in New Zealand.
METHODS: We analysed 18 months of user data from the Just a Thought website to 
understand the characteristics of those who used the Depression and Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder courses, how many lessons they completed, how mental distress 
changed across each course and the factors associated with adherence and 
improvement in mental health.
RESULTS: The results for both courses followed very similar patterns. Course 
adherence was low overall. There were small differences in adherence by age, 
gender and ethnicity, and larger differences for those who were 'prescribed' 
Just a Thought by a healthcare worker. Mixed models showed significant 
reductions in mental distress, with some tapering of improvement across latter 
lessons. Those most likely to show clinically meaningful reductions in mental 
distress had completed more lessons, were older and had a higher baseline level 
of distress.
CONCLUSION: Alongside previous efficacy research, this real-world data indicate 
that iCBT is most likely to be effective at the population level and across 
different subgroups if users complete as much of the course as possible. 
Strategies to increase course adherence and maximise the public health benefits 
of iCBT include healthcare workers 'prescribing' iCBT and tailored solutions to 
meet the needs of young people, Māori and Pasifika.

PURPOSE: This study reports the short- and mid-term benefits of an eight-session 
emotion and self-regulation group intervention ecologically boosted through 
daily app-based prompts. The intervention was designed for breast cancer 
patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels 
of psychological symptoms.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to the immediate intervention arm 
(n = 61; intervention received immediately) or to the delayed intervention arm 
(n = 59; intervention received 5 months later). Psychological symptoms, 
including anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, fear of cancer 
recurrence (FCR), worry, and intrusive thoughts were assessed through 
questionnaires. Emotion regulation was assessed in a dynamic emotion regulation 
task and in everyday life. Assessments were completed at baseline (T1), 5 months 
(T2) and 10 months (T3) later.
RESULTS: Treated patients reported lower levels of worry and intrusive thoughts. 
They improved their ability to down-regulate the intensity of their negative 
emotions when exposed to cancer-related triggers in the dynamic emotion 
regulation task. They reported fewer and less intense negative emotions and more 
positive emotions in their everyday life. Benefits were maintained 5 months 
later, except for positive emotions in everyday life.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that focusing on emotion regulation is a 
relevant approach in the treatment of psychological symptoms for breast cancer 
patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels 
of psychological symptoms. The intervention led to changes in patients' dynamic 
and everyday life emotion regulation. Consolidation sessions may be needed to 
sustain benefits in positive emotions and to increase the effect sizes.

Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly recommended for 
children and young people (CYP) as a promising way to prevent and treat mental 
health problems. Here, we summarised and consolidated findings from existing 
systematic reviews to provide an overview of what is known, and which areas need 
further investigation. Systematic searches were conducted until January 2024 
using PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar. Records were 
screened against predefined criteria and quality assessed using A MeaSurement 
Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) 
Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews. A study protocol was 
co-developed with key stakeholders and registered on the Open Science Framework. 
From 941 records, 51 systematic reviews published between 2000 and 2023 of 
generally moderate quality, targeting CYP 0 to 25 years, were included in our 
narrative summary. DMHIs were delivered in a variety of ways, including online 
video calls, apps and various combinations, underpinned mostly by cognitive 
behaviour therapy. DMHIs supported different mental health problems, but mostly 
symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Although generally effective, some 
studies reported mixed results with limited evidence when focusing on 
longer-term outcomes. Other benefits of DMHIs included reduced costs and time 
investments for families, and increased accessibility and acceptability of 
support. Practitioner preparedness and unclear ethics/safety measures were 
identified as factors impacting engagement and potential effectiveness. The 
findings suggest that DMHIs can be a valuable tool for supporting CYP. However, 
realising the full potential of DMHIs for all CYP may require more high-quality 
research utilising DMHIs that are diverse in theoretical underpinnings and 
target audiences.

Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Provided Through a Web Application 
for Subthreshold Depression, Subthreshold Insomnia, and Subthreshold Panic: 
Open-Labeled 6-Arm Randomized Clinical Trial Pilot Study.

BACKGROUND: A common definition of "subthreshold" is that the diagnostic 
threshold is not met but the individuals are not asymptomatic. Some symptoms are 
present, causing significant difficulty in functioning and negatively impacting 
quality of life. Despite the attention given to subthreshold symptoms and the 
interventions for subthreshold symptoms being efficient in preventing the 
transition to psychiatric disease in primary care, reports on specific 
interventions are insufficient.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of internet-delivered 
cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for subthreshold depression (SD), 
subthreshold insomnia (SI), and subthreshold panic (SP). Additionally, this 
study aimed to explore the minimally important change (MIC) of each subthreshold 
group's effectiveness outcome.
METHODS: Participants aged 18-70 years from internet research monitors were 
categorized into SD, SI, and SP groups based on screening assessment. They were 
randomly assigned to intervention or control groups within each subthreshold 
symptom. The intervention groups worked on 4 weeks of nonguided ICBT ("Mentre"), 
while the control groups worked on a sham app. The primary outcome was the score 
change from screening (T1) to 4-week follow-up (T4) using the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) in the SD group, the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in the SI group, and the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale 
(PAS) in the SP group. Secondary outcomes were score changes in the Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), 
the CESD, the PSQI, and the PAS, except the primary outcome in each group. 
Secondary outcomes were analyzed using complete-case analysis and 
repeated-measures ANOVA. Additionally, the MIC in the primary endpoint for each 
group was also calculated as an exploratory outcome.
RESULTS: The SD, SP, and SI groups contained 846, 597, and 1106 participants, 
respectively. In the SD group, the difference in the CESD score change from 
baseline to follow-up between the intervention and control groups was 
significant (difference=0.52, 95% CI 1.29-4.66, P<.001). In the SI group, the 
difference in the PSQI score change was also significant (difference=0.53, 95% 
CI 0.11-0.94, P=.01). However, in the SP group, the difference in the PAS score 
change was not significant (difference=0.07, 95% CI -2.00 to 2.15, P=.94).
CONCLUSIONS: Our ICBT program Mentre contributes to the improvement of SI and 
SD. This suggests that nonguided ICBT may be effective in preventing SI and SD 
from progressing to the full threshold. However, appropriate definitions of 
subthreshold symptoms are necessary. In particular, it is difficult to define 
SP, and further research that considers the specific factors of each 
subthreshold symptom is necessary to accumulate evidence.

Computer-delivered and web-based interventions to improve depression, anxiety, 
and psychological well-being of university students: a systematic review and 
meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common mental health difficulties 
experienced by university students and can impair academic and social 
functioning. Students are limited in seeking help from professionals. As 
university students are highly connected to digital technologies, Web-based and 
computer-delivered interventions could be used to improve students' mental 
health. The effectiveness of these intervention types requires investigation to 
identify whether these are viable prevention strategies for university students.
OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to systematically review and analyze 
trials of Web-based and computer-delivered interventions to improve depression, 
anxiety, psychological distress, and stress in university students.
METHODS: Several databases were searched using keywords relating to higher 
education students, mental health, and eHealth interventions. The eligibility 
criteria for studies included in the review were: (1) the study aimed to improve 
symptoms relating to depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress, 
(2) the study involved computer-delivered or Web-based interventions accessed 
via computer, laptop, or tablet, (3) the study was a randomized controlled 
trial, and (4) the study was trialed on higher education students. Trials were 
reviewed and outcome data analyzed through random effects meta-analyses for each 
outcome and each type of trial arm comparison. Cochrane Collaboration risk of 
bias tool was used to assess study quality.
RESULTS: A total of 17 trials were identified, in which seven were the same 
three interventions on separate samples; 14 reported sufficient information for 
meta-analysis. The majority (n=13) were website-delivered and nine interventions 
were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A total of 1795 participants 
were randomized and 1480 analyzed. Risk of bias was considered moderate, as many 
publications did not sufficiently report their methods and seven explicitly 
conducted completers' analyses. In comparison to the inactive control, 
sensitivity meta-analyses supported intervention in improving anxiety (pooled 
standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.56; 95% CI -0.77 to -0.35, P<.001), 
depression (pooled SMD -0.43; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.22, P<.001), and stress (pooled 
SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.19, P=.008). In comparison to active controls, 
sensitivity analyses did not support either condition for anxiety (pooled SMD 
-0.18; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.62, P=.66) or depression (pooled SMD -0.28; 95% CI 
-0.75 to -0.20, P=.25). In contrast to a comparison intervention, neither 
condition was supported in sensitivity analyses for anxiety (pooled SMD -0.10; 
95% CI -0.39 to 0.18, P=.48) or depression (pooled SMD -0.33; 95% CI -0.43 to 
1.09, P=.40).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest Web-based and computer-delivered interventions 
can be effective in improving students' depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes 
when compared to inactive controls, but some caution is needed when compared to 
other trial arms and methodological issues were noticeable. Interventions need 
to be trialed on more heterogeneous student samples and would benefit from user 
evaluation. Future trials should address methodological considerations to 
improve reporting of trial quality and address post-intervention skewed data.

BACKGROUND: The impacts of COVID-19 for people with obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) may be considerable. Online cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) 
programmes provide scalable access to psychological interventions, although the 
effectiveness of iCBT for OCD during COVID-19 has not been evaluated.
AIM: This study investigated the uptake and effectiveness of iCBT for OCD (both 
self- and clinician-guided courses) during the first 8 months of the pandemic in 
Australia (March to October 2020) and compared outcomes with the previous year.
METHOD: 1,343 adults (824/1343 (61.4%) female, mean age 33.54 years, SD = 12.00) 
commenced iCBT for OCD (1061 during the pandemic and 282 in the year before) and 
completed measures of OCD (Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and 
depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9) symptom severity, psychological 
distress (Kessler-10), and disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule) pre- 
and post-treatment.
RESULTS: During COVID-19, there was a 522% increase in monthly course 
registrations compared with the previous year, with peak uptake observed between 
April and June 2020 (a 1191% increase compared with April to June 2019). OCD and 
depression symptom severity were similar for the COVID and pre-COVID groups, 
although COVID-19 participants were more likely to enrol in self-guided courses 
(versus clinician-guided). In both pre- and during-COVID groups, the OCD iCBT 
course was associated with medium effect size reductions in OCD (g = 0.65-0.68) 
and depression symptom severity (g = 0.56-0.65), medium to large reductions in 
psychological distress (g = 0.77-0.83) and small reductions in disability (g = 
0.35-.50).
CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate the considerable uptake of online psychological 
services for those experiencing symptoms of OCD during COVID-19 and highlight 
the scalability of effective digital mental health services.

BACKGROUND: Mental health and functional difficulties are highly comorbid across 
neurological disorders, but supportive care options are limited. This randomised 
controlled trial assessed the efficacy of a novel transdiagnostic 
internet-delivered psychological intervention for adults with neurological 
disorders.
METHODS: 221 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple 
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or an acquired brain injury were allocated to 
either an immediate treatment group (n = 115) or treatment-as-usual waitlist 
control (n = 106). The intervention, the Wellbeing Neuro Course, was delivered 
online via the eCentreClinic website. The Course includes six lessons, based on 
cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered over 10 weeks with support from a 
psychologist via email and telephone. Primary outcomes were symptoms of 
depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and disability (WHODAS 2.0).
RESULTS: 215 participants commenced the trial (treatment n = 111; control n = 
104) and were included in intention-to-treat analysis. At post-treatment, we 
observed significant between-group differences in depression (PHQ-9; difference 
= 3.07 [95% CI 2.04-4.11], g = 0.62), anxiety (GAD-7; difference = 1.87 
[0.92-2.81], g = 0.41) and disability (WHODAS 2.0 difference = 3.08 [1.09-5.06], 
g = 0.31), that favoured treatment (all ps < 0.001). Treatment-related effects 
were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Findings were achieved with minimal 
clinician time (average of 95.7 min [s.d. = 59.3] per participant), highlighting 
the public health potential of this approach to care. No adverse treatment 
events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet-delivered psychological interventions could be a suitable 
model of accessible supportive care for patients with neurological disorders.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is increasing evidence that adjunctive, 
non-pharmacologic treatment programs are beneficial in the management of 
arthritis when added to traditional disease-modifying medications. This review 
focuses on non-pharmacologic management strategies that impact pain and affect, 
with a focus on self-efficacy, for those with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA).
RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed both office-based and internet-based 
self-management strategies, mindfulness based interventions (MBIs), and 
cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) for patients with arthritis. These 
behavioral strategies have shown to improve pain, mood disturbance, and physical 
function in those with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Improvements in self-efficacy and coping capacity are associated with 
improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) related to pain and 
functioning.
SUMMARY: Self-management programs, MBIs, and CBTs are more effective at 
improving pain and mood disturbance compared to usual care for patients with 
arthritis although high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking. 
Non-pharmacologic management programs are increasingly available via the 
internet and mobile applications.

A cognitive model of bipolar disorder suggests that mental imagery acts as an 
emotional amplifier of mood and may be heightened in bipolar disorder. First, we 
tested whether patients with bipolar disorder would score higher on mental 
imagery measures than a matched healthy control group. Second, we examined 
differences in imagery between patients divided into groups according to their 
level of mood stability. Mood ratings over approximately 6-months, made using a 
mobile phone messaging system, were used to divide patients into stable or 
unstable groups. Clinician decisions of mood stability were corroborated with 
statistical analysis. Results showed (I) compared to healthy controls, patients 
with bipolar disorder had significantly higher scores for general mental imagery 
use, more vivid imagery of future events, higher levels of intrusive prospective 
imagery, and more extreme imagery-based interpretation bias; (II) compared to 
patients with stable mood, patients with unstable mood had higher levels of 
intrusive prospective imagery, and this correlated highly with their current 
levels of anxiety and depression. The findings were consistent with predictions. 
Further investigation of imagery in bipolar disorder appears warranted as it may 
highlight processes that contribute to mood instability with relevance for 
cognitive behaviour therapy.

Severe acute and chronic pain are the most common complications of sickle cell 
disease (SCD). Pain results in disability, psychosocial distress, repeated 
clinic visits/hospitalizations, and significant healthcare costs. Psychosocial 
pain interventions that teach cognitive and behavioral strategies for managing 
pain have been effective in other adolescent populations when delivered in 
person or through digital technologies. Our aim was to conduct a multisite, 
randomized, controlled trial to improve pain and coping in youth aged 12 to 18 
years with SCD using a digital cognitive-behavioral therapy program (iCanCope 
with Sickle Cell Disease; iCC-SCD) vs Education control. We enrolled 137 
participants (ages 12-18 years, 59% female) and analyzed 111 adolescents (107 
caregivers), 54 randomized to Education control and 57 randomized to iCC-SCD. 
Ninety-two percent of youth completed posttreatment assessments and 88% 
completed 6-month follow-up. There was a significant effect of treatment group 
(iCC-SCD vs Education) on reduction in average pain intensity from baseline to 
6-month follow-up (b = -1.32, P = 0.009, 95% CI [-2.29, -0.34], d = 0.50), and 
for the number of days with pain, adolescents in the iCC-SCD group demonstrated 
fewer pain days compared with the Education group at 6-month follow-up (incident 
rate ratio = 0.63, P = 0.006, 95% CI [0.30, 0.95], d = 0.53). Treatment effects 
were also found for coping attempts, momentary mood, and fatigue. Several 
secondary outcomes did not change with intervention, including anxiety, 
depression, pain interference, and global impression of change. Future studies 
are needed to identify effective implementation strategies to bring 
evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for sickle cell pain to SCD clinics 
and communities.

BACKGROUND: Globally, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a 
significant impact on mental health. Sudden lifestyle changes, threatening 
information received through various sources, fear of infection and other 
stressors led to sleep disturbances such as insomnia. The current study aimed to 
assess the prevalence of insomnia and its associated risk factors during the 
first wave of COVID-19 pandemic among Singapore residents.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted online and in person, from May 2020 
to June 2021, recruited Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 21 
years and above, fluent in English, Chinese or Malay language. Respondents 
answered an interviewer-administered questionnaire, including Insomnia Severity 
Index (ISI), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Physical Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), stress scale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales 
(DASS), chronic conditions checklist and COVID-19 related stressors (exposure to 
COVID-19, current and future perceived risk of infection). Chi-squared test 
followed by stepwise logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine 
factors associated with insomnia.
RESULTS: The study recruited 1129 respondents. Prevalence of insomnia was noted 
to be 7.4% in the sample. Insomnia was significantly associated with 
psychological distress- depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001), 
financial loss as a source of stress (p < 0.012), ever been diagnosed with 
asthma (p < 0.001) and backache (p < 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Insomnia was prevalent and associated with higher level of 
psychological distress among Singapore residents. These findings can be utilised 
to design effective targeted interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy, 
therapist assisted relaxation and meditation programs to improve sleep and 
reduce psychological distress. Interventions like these can be delivered via 
smartphone applications enabling easy access, delivery, and utilization by the 
vulnerable groups. Overall, these strategies would not only help people maintain 
better mental health and sleep quality during a pandemic but also build 
resilience, enhancing society's ability to cope with future crises.

Improving Employee Well-Being and Effectiveness: Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis of Web-Based Psychological Interventions Delivered in the 
Workplace.

BACKGROUND: Stress, depression, and anxiety among working populations can result 
in reduced work performance and increased absenteeism. Although there is 
evidence that these common mental health problems are preventable and treatable 
in the workplace, uptake of psychological treatments among the working 
population is low. One way to address this may be the delivery of occupational 
digital mental health interventions. While there is convincing evidence for 
delivering digital psychological interventions within a health and community 
context, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis of these interventions 
in an occupational setting.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of 
occupational digital mental health interventions in enhancing employee 
psychological well-being and increasing work effectiveness and to identify 
intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and 
adherence.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Cochrane 
guidelines. Papers published from January 2000 to May 2016 were searched in the 
PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases, as well 
as the databases of the researchers and relevant websites. Unpublished data was 
sought using the Conference Proceedings Citation Index and the Clinical Trials 
and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) research 
registers. A meta-analysis was conducted by applying a random-effects model to 
assess the pooled effect size for psychological well-being and the work 
effectiveness outcomes. A positive deviance approach was used to identify those 
intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and 
adherence.
RESULTS: In total, 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the search 
criteria. Occupational digital mental health interventions had a statistically 
significant effect post intervention on both psychological well-being (g=0.37, 
95% CI 0.23-0.50) and work effectiveness (g=0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41) compared 
with the control condition. No statistically significant differences were found 
on either outcome between studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
approaches (as defined by the authors) compared with other psychological 
approaches, offering guidance compared with self-guidance, or recruiting from a 
targeted workplace population compared with a universal workplace population. 
In-depth analysis of the interventions identified by the positive deviance 
approach suggests that interventions that offer guidance are delivered over a 
shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering 
the interventions and engaging users (ie, emails and text messages [short 
message service, SMS]), and use elements of persuasive technology (ie, 
self-monitoring and tailoring), which may achieve greater engagement and 
adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that occupational digital mental 
health interventions can improve workers' psychological well-being and increase 
work effectiveness. It identifies intervention characteristics that may increase 
engagement. Recommendations are made for future research, practice, and 
intervention development.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a proven treatment for many 
psychological disorders. It has been extensively studied and is effective for 
anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, a bibliometric analysis of the 
CBT literature for these disorders is needed. This study reviewed this field's 
research and identifies key trends, influential studies, and gaps.
METHODS: Using MeSH-generated keywords and PRISMA guidelines, the Scopus 
database retrieved bibliographic data without temporal or geographical 
constraints. Data-driven studies were analyzed for performance, collaborative 
pattern, impact, co-word frequency, knowledge structure, and trending topics 
using R-package-based Bibliometrix and VOSviewer applications. The current study 
applied bibliometric and statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Scopus yielded 2757 studies since inception in 1979. The polynomial 
regression coefficient of 0.945 (R2) indicates a strong positive trend, and the 
research has increased at an annual rate of 12.67 %. Scholars from five 
countries had a noteworthy production of CBT research in treating PsD, namely 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands. 
Depression, oppositional defiant disorder, schizophrenia, and implementation are 
the clusters in the CBT research map. The thematic map needed to meet the 
desired criteria for representing all anticipated themes. Thematic evolution is 
evidence of noticeable changes that contributed to the creation of new research 
clusters and the disappearance of some of them. COVID-19 has significantly 
impacted the adoption and efficacy of internet-based interventions for mental 
health. The cross-sectional study provides valuable insights into the 
development and dissemination of CBT in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance 
of training, awareness, and research.
CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes that further investigation be conducted in 
contemporary literature to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing policy 
decisions regarding CBT.

BACKGROUND: eHealth technologies offer an efficient method to integrate park 
prescriptions into clinical practice by primary health care (PHC) providers to 
help patients improve their health via tailored, nature-based health behavior 
interventions. This paper describes the protocol of the GoalRx Prescription 
Intervention (GPI) which was designed to leverage community resources to provide 
tailored park prescriptions for PHC patients.
METHODS: The GPI study was designed as a 3-arm, multi-site observational study. 
We enrolled low-income, rural adults either at-risk of or living with 
hypertension or diabetes (n = 75) from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) 
in two counties in North Carolina, USA into the 3-month intervention. Eligible 
participants self-selected to receive (1) a tailored park prescription 
intervention; (2) a tailored home/indoor PA prescription intervention; or (3) a 
healthy eating prescription (with no PA prescription beyond standard PA 
counseling advice that is already routinely provided in PHC) as the comparison 
group. The GPI app paired patient health data from the electronic health record 
with stated patient preferences and triggered app-integrated SMS motivation and 
compliance messaging directly to the patient. Patients were assessed at baseline 
and at a 3-month follow-up upon the completion of the intervention. The primary 
outcome (mean difference in weekly physical activity from baseline (T0) to 
post-intervention (T1) as measured by the Fitbit Flex 2) was assessed at 3 
months. Secondary outcomes included assessment of the relationship between the 
intervention and biological markers of health, including body mass index (BMI), 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c or available glucose test (if 
applicable), and a depression screen score using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire 9. Secondary outcomes also included the total number of SMS 
messages sent, number of SMS messages responded to, number of SMS messages 
ignored, and opt-out rate.
DISCUSSION: The goal was to create a protocol utilizing eHealth technologies 
that addressed the specific needs of rural low-income communities and fit into 
the natural rhythms and processes of the selected FQHC clinics in North 
Carolina. This protocol offered a higher standard of health care by connecting 
patients to their PHC teams and increasing patient motivation to make 
longer-lasting health behavior changes.

BACKGROUND: Internet cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for health anxiety has 
demonstrated efficacy but has not been evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This study presents the first evaluation of the uptake and outcomes of iCBT for 
health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: THIS WAY UP is an Australian digital mental health service which 
delivers iCBT interventions to community members. We compared the uptake of THIS 
WAY UP's iCBT course for health anxiety in an Australian adult sample who 
started the course before the pandemic (12th September 2019-11 th March 2020) to 
during the pandemic (12th March to 11th June 2020). The course was accessible to 
Australian adults over 18 years old, with no inclusion criteria. Outcomes 
included course registrations and commencements, lesson and course completion, 
and self-reported health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory), depression 
(Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item) and distress (Kessler-10).
RESULTS: From March to June 2020, we observed significant increases in course 
registrations (N = 238 vs N = 1057); and course commencements (N = 126 vs. 
N = 778). Large, significant improvements in health anxiety (g = 0.89), and 
distress (K10: g = 0.91), and medium improvements in depression (g = 0.55) were 
found. Course completion during COVID was 30.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: iCBT improved health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
provides scalable intervention that can address increased demands for mental 
health services in the community.

OBJECTIVE: Medical students experience high rates of depression, and often face 
barriers to receiving traditional mental health services. Internet-based 
cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs offer a more accessible method of 
receiving care. Here, we conducted an open trial of an iCBT program for medical 
students and characterize program usage, program users, and self-reported 
psychosocial symptoms and coping skills.
METHODS: All incoming first year medical students at a large state-run 
university were invited to use an iCBT program which focused on mood management 
and mood symptom prevention. Participants received access to the 16-week program 
and completed measures of perceived stress, quality of life, and the development 
of cognitive and behavioral coping skills at baseline and end of program.
RESULTS: Of the 194 students in the class, 53 (27.32%) signed up to use the 
program. While the program attracted a representative portion of 
underrepresented minority students, program engagement among males was 
particularly low. Repeated use of the program was low. Self-reported symptoms of 
depression and anxiety were low at baseline, and continued to be low at end of 
program. Slight increases were observed from baseline to end of program in the 
self-reported use of cognitive coping skills.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital mental health tools appear to be of interest to first year 
medical students, but need to be better designed to support continued program 
use and to attract specific subgroups of students who may face additional 
barriers to seeking mental health services.

PURPOSE: Driving phobia is prevalent in injured individuals following motor 
vehicle crashes (MVCs). The evidence for virtual reality (VR) based 
psychological treatments for driving phobia is unknown. This systematic review 
synthesized the available evidence on the effectiveness, feasibility, and user 
experience of psychological treatments for driving phobia using VR.
METHODS: Three databases (PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and PubMed) were searched. 
Eligibility criteria included adults with clinical or sub-clinical levels of 
driving phobia manifesting as part of an anxiety disorder or post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD). Primary outcomes were driving-related anxiety/fear or 
avoidance, PTSD symptoms and driving frequency/intensity, as well as treatment 
feasibility including recruitment, treatment completion and retention rates, 
user experience and immersion/presence in the VR program. Secondary outcomes 
were other health outcomes (e.g., depression) and VR technological features.
RESULTS: The 14 included studies were of low methodological quality. Clinical 
and methodological heterogeneity prevented quantitative pooling of data. The 
evidence provided in this review is limited by trials with small sample sizes, 
and lack of diagnostic clarity, controlled designs, and long-term assessment. 
The evidence did suggest that VR-based psychological interventions could be 
feasible and acceptable in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: For VR-based psychological interventions to be recommended for 
driving phobia, more high-quality trials are needed. Implications for 
rehabilitationVirtual reality (VR) based psychological treatments may be 
feasible and acceptable to patients with driving phobia.There is potential to 
increase accessibility to psychological therapies in patients with driving 
phobia following motor vehicle crashes through the use of digital psychiatry 
such as VR.

Background/Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disease that 
impacts both physical and psychological health, increasing vulnerability to 
anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life (QoL). Psychological 
interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), have 
demonstrated promising results in enhancing emotional resilience, treatment 
adherence, and QoL. This systematic review aims to evaluate the role and 
effectiveness of psychological interventions in improving the QoL among 
individuals with CF. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted 
across the PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases for studies published between 
2014 and 2024, in line with PRISMA guidelines and a registered PROSPERO 
protocol. Out of 162 initially identified articles, six clinical studies met the 
inclusion criteria. Intervention included cognitive behavioral therapy-based 
interventions, employing several digital or telehealth formats such as 
fibrosis-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CF-CBT) and the coping and 
learning to manage stress (CALM) program, often delivered via telehealth. 
Results: Most interventions demonstrated significant reductions in depression, 
anxiety, and perceived stress, alongside improvements in coping self-efficacy 
and vitality. Cohen's d-effect sizes ranged from moderate to large for core 
psychological outcomes. QoL measures, particularly vitality and emotional 
functioning, were significantly enhanced in most studies. Conclusions: 
Psychological interventions, particularly CBT and ACT, significantly improve 
mental health and QoL in individuals with CF, supporting their integration into 
routine care.

BACKGROUND: Despite the success of gold standard cognitive-behavioral therapy 
for problem and disordered gambling, the majority of individuals with gambling 
problems do not seek or receive professional treatment. Thus, the development of 
less intrusive self-directed interventions has been encouraged. Bibliotherapy 
for problem gambling has shown promise, both alone and in combination with 
motivational interviews, but there is still a lack of online self-directed 
intervention research. The current randomized controlled trial proposes to 
assess the additive benefit of a single digital motivational interview delivered 
in conjunction with an online self-directed treatment program for problem 
gambling and gambling disorder.
METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted, wherein 
eligible participants (N=270) will be recruited across Canada via internet 
advertisements posted to several platforms. All participants will receive access 
to an online self-directed gambling intervention program. Participants will be 
randomly assigned to either complete the online program alone or receive a 
digital motivational interview, conducted through an online audioconferencing 
platform (i.e., Microsoft Teams) to supplement the online program. The primary 
outcomes of gambling severity, frequency, and expenditures will be tracked along 
with secondary outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, general distress, alcohol 
use, and online program user data) over a 24-month period. It is expected that 
participants in both groups will experience a reduction in symptoms across the 
board, but more substantial improvements will be observed in the group that 
receives a supplemental motivational interview.
DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will expand upon prior gambling 
intervention research by informing best practices for the provision of online 
self-help for problem gambling.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol misuse and emotional problems (ie, depression and anxiety) 
are highly comorbid among Canadian young adults. However, there is a lack of 
integrated, accessible, and evidence-based treatment options for these young 
adults.
OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of an 
integrated, online self-help program designed to target both alcohol misuse and 
emotional problems.
METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial design will be used to compare 
the efficacy of the online integrated treatment to a psychoeducational control 
group. A target sample of 214 participants will be recruited and randomly 
assigned to either condition. The integrated treatment will last 8 weeks, and 
participants will work through 12 modules. Modules will incorporate content 
based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational 
interviewing. Participants in the control group will receive links to 
psychoeducational resources and will have access to the full treatment after 
follow-up. The primary outcome will be the number of Canadian standard drinks 
consumed in the week leading up the assessment. Secondary outcomes of interest 
include symptoms of depression, anxiety, alcohol-related problems, quality of 
life, and use of other drugs. Assessments will be completed at 3 time-points: at 
baseline, at the end of treatment (ie, 8 weeks), and at follow-up (ie, 24 
weeks). Upon completion, data will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed 
models.
RESULTS: Data collection began in June 2018 and will continue until January 
2020. Final study results will be submitted for publication by July 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there are no integrated treatments designed to target 
alcohol misuse and the range of emotional problems experienced by young adults. 
This research stands to provide an effective, accessible (ie, Web-based), and 
feasible option to treat the many struggling young adults in this country.

BACKGROUND: Perfectionism is elevated across, and increases risk for, a range of 
psychological disorders as well as having a direct negative effect on day-to-day 
function. A growing body of evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) reduces perfectionism and psychological disorders, with medium to large 
effect sizes. Given the increased desire for Web-based interventions to 
facilitate access to evidence-based therapy, Internet-based CBT self-help 
interventions for perfectionism have been designed. Existing Web-based 
interventions have not included personalized guidance which has been shown to 
improve outcome rates.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an Internet-based guided self-help CBT 
intervention for perfectionism at reducing symptoms of perfectionism and 
psychological disorders posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial method is employed, comparing the 
treatment arm (Internet-based guided self-help CBT) with a waiting list control 
group. Outcomes are examined at 3 time points, T1 (baseline), T2 
(postintervention at 12 weeks), T3 (follow-up at 24 weeks). Participants will be 
recruited through universities, online platforms, and social media and if 
eligible will be randomized using an automatic randomizer.
RESULTS: Data will be analyzed to estimate the between group (intervention, 
control) effect on perfectionism, depression, and anxiety. Completer and 
intent-to-treat analyses will be conducted. Additional analysis will be 
conducted to investigate whether the number of modules completed is associated 
with change. Data collection should be finalized by December 2016, with 
submission of results for publication expected in mid-year 2017. Results will be 
reported in line with recommendations in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials Statement for Randomized Controlled Trials of Electronic and Mobile 
Health Applications and Online TeleHealth (CONSORT-EHEALTH).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings will contribute to the literature on treatment of 
perfectionism, the effect of treating perfectionism on depression and anxiety, 
and the efficacy of Internet-based guided self-help interventions.

BACKGROUND: It is challenging to engage repeat users of unscheduled healthcare 
with severe health anxiety in psychological help and high service costs are 
incurred. We investigated whether clinical and economic outcomes were improved 
by offering remote cognitive behaviour therapy (RCBT) using videoconferencing or 
telephone compared to treatment as usual (TAU).
METHODS: A single-blind, parallel group, multicentre randomised controlled trial 
was undertaken in primary and general hospital care. Participants were aged ≥18 
years with ≥2 unscheduled healthcare contacts within 12 months and scored >18 on 
the Health Anxiety Inventory. Randomisation to RCBT or TAU was stratified by 
site, with allocation conveyed to a trial administrator, research assessors 
masked to outcome. Data were collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The 
primary outcome was change in HAI score from baseline to six months on an 
intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes were generalised anxiety, 
depression, physical symptoms, function and overall health. Health economics 
analysis was conducted from a health service and societal perspective.
RESULTS: Of the 524 patients who were referred and assessed for trial 
eligibility, 470 were eligible and 156 (33%) were recruited; 78 were randomised 
to TAU and 78 to RCBT. Compared to TAU, RCBT significantly reduced health 
anxiety at six months, maintained to 9 and 12 months (mean change difference HAI 
-2.81; 95% CI -5.11 to -0.50; P = 0.017). Generalised anxiety, depression and 
overall health was significantly improved at 12 months, but there was no 
significant change in physical symptoms or function. RCBT was strictly dominant 
with a net monetary benefit of £3,164 per participant at a willingness to pay 
threshold of £30,000. No treatment-related adverse events were reported in 
either group.
CONCLUSIONS: RCBT may reduce health anxiety, general anxiety and depression and 
improve overall health, with considerable reductions in health and informal care 
costs in repeat users of unscheduled care with severe health anxiety who have 
previously been difficult to engage in psychological treatment. RCBT may be an 
easy-to-implement intervention to improve clinical outcome and save costs in one 
group of repeat users of unscheduled care.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 Nov 
2014 with reference number NCT02298036.

Migraine, a severe headache accompanied by nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, 
can be controlled with pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological therapies. 
In biofeedback, patients learn to voluntarily modify their bodily reactions 
through feedback mediated awareness of physiological parameters, thus promoting 
relaxation, reducing stress and preventing migraine attacks. We aim to assess 
the efficacy of biofeedback on adult patients with migraine. Study protocol was 
registered on PROSPERO with reference number CRD42024606671. PubMed, Embase and 
Google Scholar were searched for randomized controlled trials from 2000 to 2024 
in English that have evaluated the administration of biofeedback to the adult 
patients with migraine. High quality studies were included after RoB 2.0 Risk of 
Bias assessment. ANOVA with inverse variance weighting was used to compare mean 
differences across groups with 95 % confidence interval. Nine studies (558 
participants) and three studies (278 participants) respectively qualified for 
comparison of biofeedback with waiting list control and active treatment. 
Biofeedback significantly reduced headache frequency and severity compared to 
waiting-list control. However, it showed no significant difference in headache 
frequency when compared to active treatments such as pharmacotherapy or 
cognitive behavioral therapy. Additionally, improvements in migraine-related 
disability, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were reviewed. This 
meta-analysis confirms that biofeedback is an effective non-pharmacological 
intervention for reducing headache frequency and severity in migraines. 
Additionally, it appears to provide synergistic benefits when combined with 
pharmacotherapy. However, future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness 
and accessibility of home-based and app-based biofeedback to determine its 
broader clinical applicability.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores psychosocial interventions aimed at 
improving the well-being of teenage and young adult (TYA) survivors of childhood 
cancer. It focuses on post-treatment survivors aged 13-39 years, examining the 
types of interventions trialled, their efficacy in enhancing different facets of 
mental well-being, and any potential negative impacts. The review was 
prospectively registered on PROSPERO and utilised randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) to assess psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioural 
therapy, psychoeducation, peer support, and physical activity programmes.
METHODS: Fifteen studies involving 1109 participants were included, covering 
interventions across multiple modes of delivery; online, in-person, and 
app-based.
RESULTS: Interventions demonstrated varied effects on outcomes like quality of 
life, depression, anxiety, stress, mood, behaviour, coping skills, and social 
support. While some interventions, such as psychoeducation and physical activity 
programs, showed promising improvements in well-being, others demonstrated 
limited or mixed results. No significant adverse effects were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures pose 
challenges for definitive conclusions, emphasising the need for future research 
with standardised measures, consistent sample sizes, and long-term follow-up to 
better assess the sustainability of intervention effects. Overall, the findings 
highlight the importance of tailored psychosocial support to address the unique 
needs of TYA cancer survivors during their survivorship journey.

BACKGROUND: Shift work is associated with many adverse effects on health and, in 
particular, affects sleep. In nurses, one of the most common forms of insomnia 
is shift work sleep disorder. Traditional face-to-face cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia is often impractical for shift-working nurses due to 
irregular work schedules. Digital therapy presents a promising alternative to 
provide nurses with access to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of the digital SleepCare 
intervention for reducing insomnia in nurses being affected by shift work sleep 
disorder.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: 74 nurses affected by shift work sleep disorder.
METHODS: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial, SleepCare was compared to 
shift work-specific psychoeducation published digitally by the German Sleep 
Society. The diagnosis of shift work sleep disorder was established through a 
clinical interview. The primary outcome was insomnia severity as measured by the 
Insomnia Severity Index at baseline before randomization, at 8 weeks, and 
3 months after randomization. Further indicators of mental health and long-term 
hair cortisol concentration were evaluated as secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis of covariance showed a greater reduction in 
insomnia severity in the intervention group versus psychoeducation, at both 
post-intervention (d = 1.11[0.7-1.6]) and follow-up (d = 0.97 [0.5-1.4]), 
corresponding to between-group differences of 5.0 and 5.3 points on the Insomnia 
Severity Index, respectively. 56 % completed at least five of the six sessions 
and results indicated larger effects for these intervention completers with 
d = 1.49 and d = 1.28, respectively. Statistically significant effects were 
observed for sleep-related, but not other mental health indicators, for example, 
stress and depression. Reduced hair cortisol levels were observed 
post-intervention in the SleepCare group (V = 82, p = .008; Δ = -1.8 pg/mg, 44 % 
reduction from baseline).
CONCLUSIONS: SleepCare was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms to a 
clinically meaningful extent and is one of the first digitally delivered 
programs to adapt cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia with specific 
exercises to address nurses' needs for shift work. The development of effective 
strategies to promote treatment adherence seems necessary, as substantially 
larger effects were observed for intervention completers.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) 
provides flexibility but requires significant time and includes potentially 
challenging components such as sleep restriction therapy. This raises questions 
about its incremental effectiveness compared to less demanding minimal 
interventions such as sleep hygiene psychoeducation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the incremental efficacy of self-guided 
iCBT-I with optional on-demand feedback for university students with insomnia 
compared to a single session of digital psychoeducation on sleep hygiene.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 90 students with insomnia (Insomnia 
Severity Index ≥10) were randomly allocated to self-help-based iCBT-I (45/90, 
50%) or one session of digital sleep hygiene psychoeducation with stimulus 
control instructions (active control group [aCG]: 45/90, 50%). The 
self-help-based iCBT-I consisted of 6 sessions on psychoeducation, sleep 
restriction, and stimulus control, including written feedback on demand from an 
eCoach. Assessments occurred at baseline (T1), 8 weeks after treatment (T2), and 
at a 6-month follow-up (T3) via web-based self-assessment and diagnostic 
telephone interviews. The primary outcome was insomnia severity at T2. Analyses 
of covariance were conducted in an intention-to-treat sample. Secondary outcomes 
included diagnoses of insomnia and major depression, sleep quality, sleep 
efficiency, worrying, recovery experiences, recovery activities, presenteeism, 
procrastination, cognitive irritation, and recuperation in sleep.
RESULTS: There was no difference in insomnia severity at T2 between the iCBT-I 
group (mean 11.27, SD 5.21) and aCG group (mean 12.36, SD 4.16; F1,989.03=1.12; 
P=.29; d=-0.26; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.17). A significant difference emerged at T3 
(iCBT-I: mean 9.43, SD 5.36; aCG: mean 12.44, SD 5.39; F1,426.15=4.72; P=.03), 
favoring iCBT-I with a medium effect (d=-0.57; 95% CI 1.07 to -0.06). Most 
secondary outcomes revealed no significant differences between the groups. In 
total, 51% (23/45) of participants in the iCBT-I group completed all 6 sessions, 
and 69% (31/45) completed the 4 core sessions.
CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, students might benefit from low-intensity, 
easily accessible digital sleep hygiene psychoeducation or iCBT-I. However, it 
appears that iCBT-I offers superiority over sleep hygiene psychoeducation in the 
long term.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 60%-80% of the primary care visits have a 
psychological stress component, but only 3% of patients receive stress 
management advice during these visits. Given recent advances in natural language 
processing, there is renewed interest in mental health chatbots. Conversational 
agents that can understand a user's problems and deliver advice that mitigates 
the effects of daily stress could be an effective public health tool. However, 
such systems are complex to build and costly to develop.
OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, our aim is to develop and evaluate a 
fully automated mobile suite of shallow chatbots-we call them Popbots-that may 
serve as a new species of chatbots and further complement human assistance in an 
ecosystem of stress management support.
METHODS: After conducting an exploratory Wizard of Oz study (N=14) to evaluate 
the feasibility of a suite of multiple chatbots, we conducted a web-based study 
(N=47) to evaluate the implementation of our prototype. Each participant was 
randomly assigned to a different chatbot designed on the basis of a proven 
cognitive or behavioral intervention method. To measure the effectiveness of the 
chatbots, the participants' stress levels were determined using self-reported 
psychometric evaluations (eg, web-based daily surveys and Patient Health 
Questionnaire-4). The participants in these studies were recruited through email 
and enrolled on the web, and some of them participated in follow-up interviews 
that were conducted in person or on the web (as necessary).
RESULTS: Of the 47 participants, 31 (66%) completed the main study. The findings 
suggest that the users viewed the conversations with our chatbots as helpful or 
at least neutral and came away with increasingly positive sentiment toward the 
use of chatbots for proactive stress management. Moreover, those users who used 
the system more often (ie, they had more than or equal to the median number of 
conversations) noted a decrease in depression symptoms compared with those who 
used the system less often based on a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (W=91.50; 
Z=-2.54; P=.01; r=0.47). The follow-up interviews with a subset of the 
participants indicated that half of the common daily stressors could be 
discussed with chatbots, potentially reducing the burden on human coping 
resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that suites of shallow chatbots may offer 
benefits for both users and designers. As a result, this study's contributions 
include the design and evaluation of a novel suite of shallow chatbots for daily 
stress management, a summary of benefits and challenges associated with random 
delivery of multiple conversational interventions, and design guidelines and 
directions for future research into similar systems, including authoring chatbot 
systems and artificial intelligence-enabled recommendation algorithms.

The COVID pandemic is now leading to the emergence of a secondary mental health 
pandemic. Clients with psychosis are at increased risk of poorer medium- and 
long-term psychosocial and clinical outcomes. In response to the pressing need 
to flexibly deliver high-quality care to individuals with psychosis, this brief 
report proposes high yield cognitive behavioral techniques for psychosis 
(HY-CBt-p) facilitated by task sharing and digital enhancements. HY-CBt-p is 
delivered over fewer sessions than formulation-based Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy for psychosis (CBTp), can be learned by a range of providers, and 
includes techniques such as developing a normalizing explanation; techniques to 
reduce anxiety, depression, and insomnia, which perpetuate psychotic symptoms; 
self-monitoring; reality testing; and wellness planning. Previous research 
suggests that effect sizes will be lower than that of 16-session 
formulation-driven CBTp, but additional research is needed to test the 
feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and comparative effectiveness of different 
forms of remote-delivered CBTp.

Brief, transdiagnostic interventions are an efficient form of mental health care 
for resource-limited settings like universities. Little research, however, has 
examined for whom these treatments are most effective. One important factor may 
be psychotherapy treatment history. Here, we evaluate if treatment history 
influences the effects of a single-session cognitive behavioral group 
intervention with optional digital follow-up support across two independent, 
university-based studies. Undergraduate (N = 143) and graduate (N = 51) students 
reported their psychotherapy treatment history and completed self-report 
measures of emotional health before and approximately 1-month following the 
intervention. Across both samples, psychotherapy treatment history did not 
moderate changes in depression, anxiety, or emotional avoidance following the 
intervention. However, participants who were currently receiving psychotherapy 
began the workshop with lower coping self-efficacy than peers with no prior 
psychotherapy and saw larger gains in coping self-efficacy at follow-up. Results 
suggest that regardless of whether a student has previously received 
psychotherapy, they may benefit from brief, group transdiagnostic interventions.

Supported Web-Based Guided Self-Help for Insomnia for Young People Attending 
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services: Protocol for a Feasibility 
Assessment.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance in adolescents is common, with up to one-third 
reporting significant symptoms of insomnia. Research with adults has 
demonstrated that Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) can 
improve both sleep and mental health. However, research with adolescents is 
lacking, and we know little about whether CBTi would have similar effects on 
this younger population.
OBJECTIVE: This paper summarizes the protocol of a study to assess the 
feasibility of adding supported Web-based CBTi to the usual care of young people 
aged 14-17 years attending specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health 
Services (CAMHS).
METHODS: This is an open trial where we will recruit young people (N=50) aged 
14-17 years attending specialist CAMHS with primary or comorbid symptoms of 
insomnia. In addition to their usual care, young people will be provided with 
Sleepio, a 6-session, Web-based CBTi self-help program for insomnia. Sleepio 
teaches a range of techniques including sleep hygiene, relaxation training, 
stimulus control, sleep restriction, and cognitive techniques that participants 
will be helped to apply through brief, weekly telephone support calls. 
Questionnaires and interviews will be completed at baseline and postintervention 
(8-10 weeks) and will assess sleep, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and 
acceptability of Sleepio and telephone support.
RESULTS: Recruitment started in May 2018 and continued until the end of October 
2018.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide preliminary evidence about whether 
supported Web-based CBTi is acceptable to young people with mental health 
problems and about the postintervention effects on sleep and symptoms of anxiety 
and depression. This information will determine whether a randomized trial to 
determine the effectiveness of Sleepio should be undertaken.

BACKGROUND: Research suggests there is heterogeneity in treatment response for 
internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) users, but few studies 
have investigated the trajectory of individual symptom change across iCBT 
treatment. Large patient data sets using routine outcome measures allows the 
investigation of treatment effects over time as well as the relationship between 
outcomes and platform use. Understanding trajectories of symptom change, as well 
as associated characteristics, may prove important for tailoring interventions 
or identifying patients who may not benefit from the intervention.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify latent trajectories of symptom change during the 
iCBT treatment course for depression and anxiety and to investigate the 
patients' characteristics and platform use for each of these classes.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial 
designed to examine the effectiveness of guided iCBT for anxiety and depression 
in the UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program. This study 
included patients from the intervention group (N=256) and followed a 
longitudinal retrospective design. As part of the IAPT's routine outcome 
monitoring system, patients were prompted to complete the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) after each 
supporter review during the treatment period. Latent class growth analysis was 
used to identify the underlying trajectories of symptom change across the 
treatment period for both depression and anxiety. Differences in patient 
characteristics were then evaluated between these trajectory classes, and the 
presence of a time-varying relationship between platform use and trajectory 
classes was investigated.
RESULTS: Five-class models were identified as optimal for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7. 
Around two-thirds (PHQ-9: 155/221, 70.1%; GAD-7: 156/221, 70.6%) of the sample 
formed various trajectories of improvement classes that differed in baseline 
score, the pace of symptom change, and final clinical outcome score. The 
remaining patients were in 2 smaller groups: one that saw minimal to no gains 
and another with consistently high scores across the treatment journey. Baseline 
severity, medication status, and program assigned were significantly associated 
(P<.001) with different trajectories. Although we did not find a time-varying 
relationship between use and trajectory classes, we found an overall effect of 
time on platform use, suggesting that all participants used the intervention 
significantly more in the first 4 weeks (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients benefit from treatment, and the various patterns of 
improvement have implications for how the iCBT intervention is delivered. 
Identifying predictors of nonresponse or early response might inform the level 
of support and monitoring required for different types of patients. Further work 
is necessary to explore the differences between these trajectories to understand 
what works best for whom and to identify early on those patients who are less 
likely to benefit from treatment.

BACKGROUND: Suicide-related behaviour among young people is of significant 
concern, yet little is known regarding the effectiveness of interventions 
designed to reduce risk among this population. Of those interventions that have 
been tested, cognitive-behavioural therapy appears to show some promise among 
young people with suicidal ideation. Internet-based interventions are becoming 
increasingly popular and have shown some effect in preventing and treating 
depression and anxiety in young people. However, to date there are no randomised 
controlled trials examining the impact of Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural 
Therapy among suicidal youth.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised controlled trial testing the effects of 
Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy among suicidal high school students 
who have sought help from the school wellbeing team. The intervention comprises 
8 modules of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy delivered online. The study has a 
staggered, two-year recruitment phase and participants are assessed at baseline, 
post intervention and 12 weeks later.
DISCUSSION: If effective the program has the ability to be readily adapted and 
delivered to a range of populations in a range of settings, at relatively little 
cost. It can also be adapted for mobile applications.

Background: Substance use disorders (SUD) are debilitating conditions that 
frequently co-occur with other mental disorders. Internet-delivered dialectical 
behavior therapy (iDBT) skills training may be promising for SUD; however, 
little research has examined predictors of engagement and treatment outcome. 
Methods: This is a secondary, exploratory analysis of a randomized, 
waitlist-controlled trial of self-guided iDBT for SUD. Participants (N = 72) 
were allocated to an immediate or delayed arm, with the latter receiving access 
after 4 weeks. All participants were followed for 12 weeks total. The primary 
treatment outcome was SUD severity, and secondary outcomes included SUD 
diagnosis and functional disability. Engagement was assessed as the number of 
hours and unique days spent on iDBT, as well as inactivity after 4 weeks. 
Multilevel modeling and standard regression approaches were used to explore 
associations between predictors and treatment outcome or engagement. Results: 
Immediate arm membership, greater pretreatment SUD severity, and fewer SUD 
diagnoses were associated with greater reductions SUD severity. Greater 
expectancy of change and greater pretreatment disability were associated with 
greater reductions in functional disability. Spending at least 1 hour on iDBT 
was associated with being older, while greater days of use was related to 
immediate arm membership, identifying as non-Hispanic White or a sexual 
minority, and having fewer pretreatment depression/anxiety symptoms. Finally, 
inactivity at 4 weeks was predicted by pretreatment depression/anxiety symptoms. 
Conclusions: These exploratory analyses highlight several demographic and 
clinical variables of individuals who may require more support to achieve 
greater therapeutic benefits in self-guided iDBT interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, characterized by distressing and 
repetitive thoughts and behaviors, frequently onset during adolescence for 
individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety disorders. Digital 
mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer a promising platform to deliver mental 
health treatment, which may address OC symptoms. The purpose of this 
retrospective study was to determine the effects of a DMHI, Bend Health, on 
various domains of OC symptoms, including contamination, responsibility (for 
harm), unwanted thoughts, and symmetry, in adolescents.
METHODS: OC symptoms were assessed at baseline (before beginning care) and 
monthly in adolescents engaged in different care programs involving coaching 
and/or therapy with the DMHI. Retrospective analyses were used to identify 
characteristics associated with OC symptoms (N = 2151) and to characterize 
treatment responsiveness of adolescents with elevated OC symptoms (n = 553).
RESULTS: Adolescents with elevated OC symptoms (32.2%; n = 693 of 2151) were 
more likely than those with non-elevated OC symptoms to be female (p < .001), to 
have comorbid symptoms (e.g. anxiety and depression; p < .001), and participate 
in therapy (p < .001). Further, their caregivers had higher rates of sleep 
problems and burnout (p < .05). OC symptoms improved for 87.7% (n = 485 of 532) 
of adolescents during care with the DMHI, and 46.6% (n = 249 of 534) reported 
clinically substantive improvement. Scores decreased significantly over months 
in care (t1187 = -8.06, p < .001). Improvements were also identified for OC 
symptom dimensions (contamination, responsibility (for harm), unwanted thoughts, 
and symmetry).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results deliver compelling preliminary evidence that 
participation in coaching and therapy with a DMHI may mitigate a variety of OC 
symptoms for adolescents. Improvements were observed across different OC symptom 
types, demonstrating the broad applicability of the DMHI to address various 
presentations and complexities of OC symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: This trial tests the efficacy of implementing a hybrid digital 
cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) and emotion regulation (ER) 
in the workplace. The study protocol follows the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol 
Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials) 2013 recommendations.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed methods evaluation with a two-arm 
randomised waitlist control design of a 6-week dCBT-I+ER intervention through 
self-guided online platform and four videoconferencing therapy sessions. A 
process evaluation will examine the fidelity of delivery and experiences of the 
intervention. The primary outcomes are the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient 
Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7. The secondary 
outcomes are job productivity, job satisfaction, well-being, quality of life, 
self-reported (sleep diary data) and objective (actigraphy) sleep parameters, 
and usage of online intervention platform. Assessments take place at baseline 
(T0), week 8 post-treatment (T1) and week 12 postrandomisation (T2). We will 
recruit 156 workers with sleep and ER problems ranging from subclinical to 
clinical levels not engaged in treatment at the time of the trial.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full approval was given by the University of Warwick 
Biomedical and Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 45/20-21). The current protocol 
version is 2.9_Dec21. Publication of results will inform the scientific, 
clinical and business communities through peer-reviewed articles, webinars, 
conferences and newsletters.

INTRODUCTION: Consolidation of motor skill learning, a key component of 
rehabilitation post-stroke, is known to be sleep dependent. However, disrupted 
sleep is highly prevalent after stroke and is often associated with poor motor 
recovery and quality of life. Previous research has shown that digital cognitive 
behavioural therapy (dCBT) for insomnia can be effective at improving sleep 
quality after stroke. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the 
potential for sleep improvement using a dCBT programme, to improve 
rehabilitation outcomes after stroke.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a parallel-arm randomised controlled trial 
of dCBT (Sleepio) versus treatment as usual among individuals following stroke 
affecting the upper limb. Up to 100 participants will be randomly allocated 
(2:1) into either the intervention (6-8 week dCBT) or control (continued 
treatment as usual) group. The primary outcome of the study will be change in 
insomnia symptoms pre to post intervention compared with treatment as usual. 
Secondary outcomes include improvement in overnight motor memory consolidation 
and sleep measures between intervention groups, correlations between changes in 
sleep behaviour and overnight motor memory consolidation in the dCBT group and 
changes in symptoms of depression and fatigue between the dCBT and control 
groups. Analysis of covariance models and correlations will be used to analyse 
data from the primary and secondary outcomes.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approval from the National 
Research Ethics Service (22/EM/0080), Health Research Authority (HRA) and Health 
and Care Research Wales (HCRW), IRAS ID: 306 291. The results of this trial will 
be disseminated via presentations at scientific conferences, peer-reviewed 
publication, public engagement events, stakeholder organisations and other forms 
of media where appropriate.

This study assessed the initial feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an 
intervention aimed at reducing dating violence and sexual risk behavior in a 
sample of adolescent girls (ages 14-17) with prior exposure to physical dating 
violence (DV). One hundred and nine girls were randomly assigned to Date SMART 
(Skills to Manage Aggression in Relationships for Teens) or a Knowledge-only 
(KO) comparison group. Both intervention arms consisted of six, weekly 2-h 
sessions and one "booster" session 6 weeks later. Based on principles of 
cognitive behavioral therapy, the Date SMART intervention was designed to target 
common underlying skills deficits linked to both DV and sexual risk behavior in 
adolescent females: depression, self-regulation deficits, and interpersonal 
skills deficits. Assessments were administered at four time points (baseline, 3, 
6, and 9 months). The Date SMART group was effective as reducing sexual DV 
involvement across the 9-month follow-up period. Both groups evidenced 
clinically meaningful reductions in physical, emotional, and digital DV 
involvement, total time in dating relationships, as well as reductions in 
depression. Findings indicate that delivering a DV and sexual risk prevention 
intervention to DV-affected adolescent girls is feasible and well-received. 
Furthermore, a skills-based approach that addresses the co-occurrence of DV and 
sexual risk behavior may be particularly useful for promoting reductions of 
sexual DV among high-risk adolescent girls. A future, large-scale trial with an 
inactive comparison condition is needed to evaluate the efficacy of Date SMART 
further.

Objective: e-Health or web-based systems in the field of tinnitus have gained 
increasing interest. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via the 
internet is currently witnessing a surge in both attention and offerings. This 
systematic review analyzed the efficacy and sustainability of internet-based 
therapies aimed at reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities such as anxiety, 
depression, and sleep disorders. The review exclusively considered randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) in which trained personnel were actively involved 
during intervention. Methods: Utilizing search terms such as tinnitus, 
internet-based therapy, and e-Health therapy, we identified 155 studies, from 
which 37 RCTs were carefully examined for data availability. Primary outcome 
measures included treatment effects for tinnitus distress (Tinnitus 
Questionnaire and other questionnaires) and handicap (Tinnitus Handicap 
Inventory), while secondary outcomes encompassed depression, anxiety, and sleep 
problems. Meta-analyses were conducted employing random-effect models. A study 
effect model was applied, yielding a singular effect size for each sample. The 
effect sizes were examined for influences of various moderators. Results: We 
found a statistically significant large effect size for improvement in tinnitus 
distress (d = 0.83; [confidence interval 0.61-1.06] with total n = 450 for the 
experimental group and total n = 504 or the controls), while the reduction of 
tinnitus handicap was smaller (moderate effect size d = 0.59; [0.44-0.73]). Less 
strong but still significant effects resulted for depression, anxiety, and 
insomnia. Most of the long-term outcomes remained stable. As moderators, the 
risk of bias (RoB) and the severity of tinnitus manifestations were identified. 
Conclusions: Internet-based therapy provides a valuable avenue for initial 
therapeutic contact, as supporting component in tinnitus treatment if 
accompanied by therapists. The heterogeneous quality with high drop-out rates or 
partly high RoB and the wide range of interventions (counseling, eCBT, 
mindfulness) might be considered as a limiting factor for a first-line 
management in tinnitus. So far, the use of e-Health is dependent on availability 
or user preferences.

BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a debilitating mental health 
disorder with first-line treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
and pharmacotherapy. CBT is costly, time-consuming, and inaccessible. Electronic 
delivery (e-CBT) is a promising solution to address these barriers. However, due 
to the novelty of this intervention, more research testing the e-CBT efficacy 
independently and in conjunction with other treatments is needed.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of e-CBT compared to and in 
conjunction with pharmacotherapy for GAD.
METHODS: This study employed a quasi-experimental design where patients selected 
their preferred treatment modality. Patients with GAD were enrolled in either 
e-CBT, medication, or combination arms. The 12-week e-CBT program was delivered 
through a digital platform. The medications followed clinical guidelines. The 
efficacy of each arm was evaluated using questionnaires measuring depression, 
anxiety, and stress severity, as well as quality of life.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between arms (N e-CBT = 41; N 
Medication = 41; N Combination = 33) in the number of weeks completed or 
baseline scores. All arms showed improvements in anxiety scores after treatment. 
The medication and combination arms improved depression scores. The e-CBT and 
Combination arms improved quality of life, and the combination arm improved 
stress scores. There were no differences between the groups in depression, 
anxiety, or stress scores post-treatment. However, the combination arm had a 
significantly larger improvement in quality of life. Gender and treatment arm 
were not predictors of dropout, whereas younger age was.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating e-CBT on its own or in combination with pharmaceutical 
interventions is a viable option for treating GAD. Treating GAD with e-CBT or 
medication appears to offer significant improvements in symptoms, with no 
meaningful difference between the two. Combining the treatments also offer 
significant improvements, while not necessarily superior to either 
independently. The findings suggest that all options are viable. Taking the 
patient's preferred treatment route based on their lifestyle, personality, and 
beliefs into account when deciding on treatment should be a priority for care 
providers.

BACKGROUND: The effect of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) 
on anxiety in adults is well-known. However, patient dropouts and poor adherence 
to treatment are common. Feelings of belonging and empowerment from the 
treatment might be key to the completion of iCBT. Peer support workers are 
people with a personal experience of mental health problems, trained to provide 
professional support to people who require mental health care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess patient experiences; the feasibility, 
safety, and acceptability; and preliminary effectiveness on anxiety and 
depression, empowerment, and adherence to treatment in an 8-week peer-supported 
iCBT program for patients with anxiety disorders treated in primary care.
METHODS: This was a single-arm mixed methods feasibility study. Participants 
were patients referred to a central unit for iCBT in primary care. Quantitative 
data were collected pre-, post-, and 3 months postintervention. Qualitative data 
were collected through semistructured interviews.
RESULTS: A total of 9 participants completed the quantitative outcome 
assessment. Statistically significant improvements were observed in perceived 
empowerment at a 3-month follow-up, and significant decreases in anxiety, 
depression, and psychological distress at the end of the treatment were 
maintained at a 3-month follow-up. In total, 8 of the 9 patients showed 
improvement in the severity of their symptoms of anxiety. Adherence to treatment 
was good among the participants. No serious adverse events were reported. Eight 
participants were enrolled in the qualitative analysis. The qualitative results 
showed 3 main themes: (1) real contact in an online world, (2) empowering 
experiences, and (3) being behind the wheel. Qualitative results largely 
emphasized the personal relationship and supported the acceptability of adding 
peer support to iCBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Peer support in digital treatment seems to be a safe and acceptable 
intervention. The preliminary results suggest the effectiveness of peer support 
on patient empowerment, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and 
adherence to treatment. The results indicate the need for future studies to 
evaluate the effect of adding peer support to iCBT in larger randomized 
controlled trials.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health and 
well-being of children and adolescents globally. This comprehensive narrative 
review synthesizes current research on the pandemic's psychological effects on 
young people, examining emotional distress, behavioral changes, sleep 
disturbances, educational disruptions, and the exacerbation of pre-existing 
mental health conditions. A systematic literature search was conducted using 
PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science, covering articles 
published from January 2020 to December 2024. Studies focusing on children and 
adolescents (aged 0-18 years) that examined mental health outcomes related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Data extraction was performed using a 
standardized form, and a narrative synthesis approach was employed to analyze 
and integrate the findings. Key findings reveal a substantial increase in 
anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among children and 
adolescents during the pandemic. School closures, social isolation, and 
disrupted routines have contributed to these mental health challenges. Sleep 
patterns have been notably affected, with delayed bedtimes, increased sleep 
disturbances, and a higher prevalence of insomnia and nightmares. The pandemic 
has widened educational disparities, particularly affecting children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds. Individuals with pre-existing mental health 
conditions have experienced exacerbated symptoms and faced challenges in 
accessing care. Various interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, 
social-emotional learning programs, and digital mental health support, have 
shown promise in mitigating the pandemic's psychological impact on young people. 
Children were more affected, as they faced a global crisis for the first time 
with limited coping skills. Disruptions in routine, social isolation, and family 
stressors heightened anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues, making them 
more affected. This review emphasizes the need for continued research, targeted 
interventions, and policy development to address the long-term mental health 
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety is a mental disorder characterized by apprehension, tension, 
uneasiness, and other related behavioral disturbances. One of the 
nonpharmacological treatments used for reducing anxiety is serious games, which 
are games that have a purpose other than entertainment. The effectiveness of 
serious games in alleviating anxiety has been investigated by several systematic 
reviews; however, they were limited by design and methodological weaknesses.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of serious games in 
alleviating anxiety by summarizing the results of previous studies and providing 
an up-to-date review.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs). The following seven databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We also conducted 
backward and forward reference list checking for the included studies and 
relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently carried out the study selection, 
data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and quality of evidence appraisal. We 
used a narrative and statistical approach, as appropriate, to synthesize the 
results of the included studies.
RESULTS: Of the 935 citations retrieved, 33 studies were included in this 
review. Of these, 22 RCTs were eventually included in the meta-analysis. Very 
low-quality evidence from 9 RCTs and 5 RCTs showed no statistically significant 
effect of exergames (games entailing physical exercises) on anxiety levels when 
compared with conventional exercises (P=.70) and no intervention (P=.27), 
respectively. Although 6 RCTs demonstrated a statistically and clinically 
significant effect of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy games on anxiety 
levels when compared with no intervention (P=.01), the quality of the evidence 
reported was low. Similarly, low-quality evidence from 3 RCTs showed a 
statistically and clinically significant effect of biofeedback games on anxiety 
levels when compared with conventional video games (P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that exergames can be as effective as 
conventional exercises in alleviating anxiety; computerized cognitive behavioral 
therapy games and exergames can be more effective than no intervention, and 
biofeedback games can be more effective than conventional video games. However, 
our findings remain inconclusive, mainly because there was a high risk of bias 
in the individual studies included, the quality of meta-analyzed evidence was 
low, few studies were included in some meta-analyses, patients without anxiety 
were recruited in most studies, and purpose-shifted serious games were used in 
most studies. Therefore, serious games should be considered complementary to 
existing interventions. Researchers should use serious games that are designed 
specifically to alleviate depression, deliver other therapeutic modalities, and 
recruit a diverse population of patients with anxiety.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered widespread adjustments across the US 
health care system. Telehealth use showed a substantial increase in mental 
health conditions and services due to acute public health emergency (PHE) 
behavioral health needs on top of long-standing gaps in access to behavioral 
health services. How health systems that were already providing behavioral 
telehealth services adjusted services and staffing during this period has not 
been well documented, particularly in rural areas with chronic shortages of 
behavioral health providers and services.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates patient and treatment characteristic changes 
from before the COVID-19 PHE to during the PHE within both telehealth and 
in-person behavioral health services provided in 95 rural communities across the 
United States.
METHODS: We used a nonrandomized, prospective, multisite research design 
involving 2 active treatment groups. The telehealth cohort included all patients 
who initiated telehealth treatment regimens during the data collection period. A 
comparison group included a cohort of patients who initiated in-person treatment 
regimen. Patient enrollment occurred on a rolling basis, and data collection was 
extended for 3 months after treatment initiation for each patient. Chi-square 
tests compared changes from pre-PHE to PHE time periods within telehealth and 
in-person treatment cohorts. The dependent measures included patient diagnosis, 
clinicians providing treatment services, and type of treatment services provided 
at each encounter. The 4780 patients in the telehealth cohort and the 6457 
patients in the in-person cohort had an average of 3.5 encounters during the 
3-month follow-up period.
RESULTS: The encounters involving anxiety, dissociative, and stress-related 
disorders in the telehealth cohort increased from 30% (698/2352) in the pre-PHE 
period to 35% (4632/12,853) in the PHE period (P<.001), and encounters involving 
substance use disorders in the in-person cohort increased from 11% (468/4249) in 
the pre-PHE period to 18% (3048/17,047) in the PHE period (P<.001). The 
encounters involving treatment service codes for alcohol, drug, and 
medication-assisted therapy in the telehealth cohort increased from 1% (22/2352) 
in the pre-PHE period to 11% (1470/13,387) in the PHE period (P<.001); likewise, 
encounters for this type of service in the in-person cohort increased from 0% 
(0/4249) in the pre-PHE period to 16% (2687/17,047) in the PHE period (P<.001). 
From the pre-PHE to the PHE period, encounters involving 60-minute psychotherapy 
in the telehealth cohort increased from 8% (190/2352) to 14% (1802/13,387; 
P<.001), while encounters involving group therapy in the in-person cohort 
decreased from 12% (502/4249) to 4% (739/17,047; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic challenged health service providers, and they 
adjusted the way both telehealth and in-person behavioral therapy services were 
delivered. Looking forward, future research is needed to explicate the 
interaction of patient, provider, setting, and intervention factors that 
influenced the patterns observed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common during childhood and adolescence and is 
associated with negative outcomes such as increased severity of pain, reduced 
function (e.g. missing school), and low mood (e.g. high levels of depression and 
anxiety). Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a 
therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. However, 
new and innovative technology is being used to deliver these psychological 
therapies remotely, meaning barriers to access to treatment such as distance and 
cost can be removed or reduced. Therapies delivered with technological devices, 
such as the Internet, computer-based programmes, smartphone applications, or via 
the telephone, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with 
chronic pain.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered 
remotely compared to waiting-list, treatment-as-usual, or active control 
treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
PsycINFO) from inception to June 2014 for randomised controlled trials of 
remotely delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents (0 
to 18 years of age) with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions 
including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial 
registries for potential trials. A citation and reference search for all 
included studies was conducted.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All included studies were randomised controlled trials that 
investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy delivered remotely via the 
Internet, smartphone device, computer-based programme, audiotapes, or over the 
phone in comparison to an active, treatment-as-usual, or waiting-list control. 
We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and 
face-to-face interaction. We excluded interventions solely delivered 
face-to-face between therapist and patient from this review. Children and 
adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with a primary chronic pain condition were 
the target of the interventions. Each comparator arm, at each extraction point 
had to include 10 or more participants.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For the analyses, we combined all psychological 
therapies. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain 
and analysed them separately. Pain, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse 
events were extracted as primary outcomes. We also extracted satisfaction with 
treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: 
first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), 
and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between 3 and 12 months 
(known as 'follow-up'). We assessed all included studies for risk of bias.
MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies (N = 371) that delivered treatment remotely were 
identified from our search; five studies investigated children with headache 
conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and 
two studies included mixed samples of children with headache and mixed (i.e. 
recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain) chronic pain conditions. The 
average age of children receiving treatment was 12.57 years.For headache pain 
conditions, we found one beneficial effect of remotely delivered psychological 
therapy. Headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 2.65, 
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.50, z = 3.62,p < 0.01, number needed to 
treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2.88). For mixed pain conditions, we found only one 
beneficial effect: psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post-treatment 
(standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.61, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.25, z = 3.38, p 
< 0.01). No effects were found for reducing pain at follow-up in either 
analysis. For headache and mixed conditions, there were no beneficial effects of 
psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment and a 
lack of data at follow-up meant no analyses could be run. Only one analysis 
could be conducted for depression outcomes. We found no beneficial effect of 
psychological therapies in reducing depression post-treatment for headache 
conditions. Only one study presented data in children with mixed pain conditions 
for depressive outcomes and no data were available for either condition at 
follow-up. Only one study presented anxiety data post-treatment and no studies 
reported follow-up data, therefore no analyses could be run. Further, there were 
no data available for adverse events, meaning that we are unsure whether 
psychological therapies are harmful to children who receive them. Satisfaction 
with treatment is described qualitatively.'Risk of bias' assessments were low or 
unclear. We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low 
risk for included studies. However, judgements made on performance and attrition 
biases were mostly unclear.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Psychological therapies delivered remotely, primarily via 
the Internet, confer benefit in reducing the intensity or severity of pain after 
treatment across conditions. There is considerable uncertainty around these 
estimates of effect and only eight studies with 371 children contribute to the 
conclusions. Future studies are likely to change the conclusions reported here. 
All included trials used either behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapies 
for children with chronic pain, therefore we cannot generalise our findings to 
other therapies. However, satisfaction with these treatments was generally 
positive. Larger trials are needed to increase our confidence in all conclusions 
regarding the efficacy of remotely delivered psychological therapies. 
Implications for practice and research are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may suffer from 
perioperative sleep disorders (PSD), and their management is challenging. The 
aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of digital cognitive behavioral 
therapy (dCBT) in the management of PSD after TKA.
METHODS: From December 2022 to August 2023, a total of 114 patients undergoing 
primary, unilateral TKA under general anaesthesia were included. The primary 
outcome was the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) score. Other outcome parameters 
included sleep quality, pain scores (NRS scores), mental disorders (hospital 
anxiety and depression scale scores and MMSE scores) and recovery quality 
(quality of recovery-40 questionnaire).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in AIS score, sleep quality, pain 
score or mental status between the two groups immediately after admission. The 
AIS scores of the dCBT group and control group were 3 (2) andvs. 3 (2.25) 
(P < 0.05) on the first postoperative day, 3 (1) vs. 3 (3) (P < 0.05) on the 
third postoperative day, and 1 (1) vs. 2 (2) (P < 0.05) on the 15th 
postoperative day, respectively. Compared with those in the control group, the 
sleep quality, anxiety scores and recovery quality in the early stage 
significantly improved in the dCBT group. However, the pain scores and cognitive 
function of the two groups were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: dCBT can decrease the severity of PSD and improve recovery quality 
in the early stage after TKA surgery. Furthermore, dCBT can relieve anxiety and 
thereby promote postoperative recovery.

INTRODUCTION: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) show promise in 
improving children's mental health, but there is limited understanding of how 
technology and screen media influence treatment outcomes. The purpose of this 
study was to leverage retrospective data to explore the relationships of 
technology and screen media use with mental health symptoms among children 
participating in a pediatric DMHI.
METHODS: Children ages 6-12 years who participated in a DMHI, Bend Health Inc, 
in the United States were included. Caregivers reported their child's screen 
media use and mental health symptoms every 30 days. Associations of screen media 
use with mental health symptoms were examined at baseline and throughout DMHI 
participation.
RESULTS: Nearly all children (98.0%) used screen media, with 58.3% exhibiting 
problematic use and 23.2% showing elevated use at baseline. Elevated screen 
media use was associated with more severe depressive (z = 2.19, P = .022) and 
anxiety symptoms (z = 2.36, P = .019) at baseline, though associations differed 
by type. Video streaming, internet use, and gaming were linked to inattention, 
hyperactivity, and oppositional behavior (P's < 0.05). While screen media use 
decreased for most children during care (93.1%), those with elevated use showed 
marginally greater improvements in anxiety (z = -1.87, P = .062) and inattention 
symptoms (z = -1.90, P = .058).
DISCUSSION: Findings suggest a nuanced interaction between technology use and 
DMHIs. Future research should explore the specific contexts of screen media use 
to optimize DMHI effectiveness and address the potential adverse effects of 
certain screen media activities.

BACKGROUND: To address the anticipated rise in mental health symptoms 
experienced at the population level during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ontario 
government provided 2 therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behavioral 
therapy (iCBT) programs to adults free of charge at the point of service.
OBJECTIVE: The study aims to explore the facilitators of and barriers to 
implementing iCBT at the population level in Ontario, Canada, from the 
perspective of patients and therapists to better understand how 
therapist-assisted iCBT programs can be effectively implemented at the 
population level and inform strategies for enhancing service delivery and 
integration into the health care system.
METHODS: Using a convenience sampling methodology, semistructured interviews 
were conducted with 10 therapists who delivered iCBT and 20 patients who 
received iCBT through either of the publicly funded programs to explore their 
perspectives of the program. Interview data were analyzed using inductive 
thematic analysis to generate themes.
RESULTS: Six salient themes were identified. Facilitators included the 
therapist-assisted nature of the program; the ease of registration and the lack 
of cost; and the feasibility of completing the psychoeducational modules given 
the online and self-paced nature of the program. Barriers included challenges 
with the online remote modality for developing the therapeutic alliance; the 
program's generalized nature, which limited customization to individual needs; 
and a lack of formal integration between the iCBT program and the health care 
system.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the program was generally well-received by patients and 
therapists due to its accessibility and feasibility, the digital format of the 
program presented both benefits and unique challenges. Strategies for improving 
the quality of service delivery include opportunities for synchronous 
communication between therapists and patients, options for increased 
customization, and the formal integration of iCBT into a broader stepped-care 
model that centralizes patient referrals between care providers and promotes 
continuity of care.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine if comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms 
(psychological distress) moderate intervention effect in participants receiving 
digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (dCBT-I) in a large-scale 
randomized controlled trial (RCT), compared to a patient education (PE) control 
condition. Further, we investigate if dCBT-I reduced levels of psychological 
distress for those with insomnia and comorbid psychological distress.
METHODS: 1721 participants with insomnia completed online assessments of sleep, 
fatigue and psychological distress, at baseline and at nine-week follow-up. 
Primary outcome was Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and secondary outcomes 
included self-reported sleep (diary), cognition, fatigue, and psychological 
distress. Participants with psychological distress (HADS>16) were separated from 
participants without psychological distress. Linear mixed models in SPSS were 
conducted to test the effects of the intervention.
RESULTS: At nine-week follow-up we found no difference in effect of the 
intervention between those who had comorbid psychological distress vs. those 
without psychological distress in terms of insomnia severity (p = 0.552) and 
fatigue (p = 0.744). Both groups had large effect size improvements on insomnia 
severity (p < 0.001=), small to medium (Cohen d < 0.08) improvements on fatigue 
(p < 0.01=) and sleep efficiency (p < 0.001), and small improvement on other 
sleep diary measures, compared to their respective control group. The 
psychological distress group showed a small, but statistically significant 
decrease in psychological distress (d = 0.2, p < 0.05) with dCBT-I compared to 
PE.
CONCLUSION: dCBT-I is a viable treatment for Insomnia also for those who have 
comorbid psychological distress.

The Impact of Social Media Use Interventions on Mental Well-Being: Systematic 
Review.

London, London, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that more social media use is related to 
poorer mental well-being and that social media use can become problematic when 
it starts to interfere with a person's daily life and mental well-being. To 
address this issue and improve users' mental well-being, social media use 
interventions (eg, abstinence from social media) have been developed and 
evaluated. However, there is limited understanding of the effectiveness of these 
interventions in improving mental well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to synthesize the literature on the 
effectiveness of social media use interventions in improving mental well-being 
in adults.
METHODS: A systematic search (January 1, 2004, to July 31, 2022) was completed 
across 3 databases in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Experimental studies 
evaluating the impact of social media use interventions on mental well-being in 
adults were included. Outcomes related to mental well-being, such as depression, 
anxiety, stress, and loneliness, were included. A narrative synthesis without 
meta-analysis was completed to summarize the study characteristics and 
effectiveness by outcome and intervention type. The Effective Public Health 
Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool was used to measure the quality of the 
studies.
RESULTS: Of the 2785 studies identified through the systematic search, 23 
(0.83%) were included in the analysis. Many of the included studies (9/23, 39%) 
found improvements in mental well-being, some (7/23, 30%) found mixed effects, 
and others (7/23, 30%) found no effect on mental well-being. Therapy-based 
interventions that used techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy were 
more effective than limiting use of social media or full abstinence from social 
media, with 83% (5/6) of these studies showing improvements in mental well-being 
compared with 20% (1/5) and 25% (3/12), respectively. Depression was the most 
frequently investigated and improved outcome with 70% (7/10) of the studies 
showing a significant improvement in depression after the intervention, whereas 
other outcomes showed more varied results. Quality was poor, with 96% (22/23) of 
the studies receiving a weak global score, mostly for issues related to 
selection bias because most of the studies (16/23, 70%) used a convenience 
sampling of university students.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides some evidence that social media use 
interventions are effective in improving mental well-being, especially for 
depression and when using therapy-based interventions. Further experimental and 
longitudinal research is needed with representative samples to investigate who 
may benefit most from social media use interventions. This will help to develop 
guidance and recommendations for policy makers and clinicians on how best to 
manage problematic social media use.

BACKGROUND: Mental health comorbidities are common in physical long-term health 
conditions.
AIMS: We evaluate the effectiveness of COMPASS, a therapist-supported, digital 
cognitive-behavioural therapy programme specifically designed to treat 
anxiety/depression in the context of long-term conditions. We also investigate 
patient experiences of the programme.
METHOD: We utilised a mixed-methods, non-randomised design. We analysed pre-post 
data from 76 patients with long-term conditions who were receiving psychological 
treatment (COMPASS) via local NHS services, using paired sample t-tests and 
Cohen's d, with depression, anxiety, distress and functional impairment 
self-report scales. Qualitative interviews explored patients' experiences of 
using COMPASS. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were completed and 
underwent inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Patients who received COMPASS had significantly reduced depression 
(-2.47, 95% CI -3.7 to -1.3, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.376), anxiety (-2.30, 95% 
CI -3.6 to -1.2, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.420) and psychological distress 
(-4.87, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.7, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.422) and significantly 
improved functional impairment (-3.00, 95% CI -4.8 to -1.2, P ≤ 0.001; Cohen's d 
= -0.282). Effect sizes were larger when analyses included only patients with 
clinically significant baseline symptoms: depression (-4.02, 95% CI -5.6 to 
-2.5, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.701), anxiety (-3.60, 95% CI -5.3 to -1.9, P < 
0.001; Cohen's d = -0.739), psychological distress (-5.58, 95% CI -7.9 to -3.2, 
P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.523), functional impairment (-3.28, 95% CI -5.4 to 
-1.1, P ≤ 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.355). Qualitative analysis yielded two 
meta-themes: engagement and integration of mental and physical health.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that COMPASS is effective in NHS settings, and is 
acceptable to patients. Content tailored to long-term conditions, therapist 
support and clear delivery strategies should be prioritised to aid intervention 
implementation.

BACKGROUND: The growing behavioral health needs of college students have 
resulted in counseling centers reporting difficulties in meeting student demand.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the real-world voluntary use by college 
students of 4 digital, self-directed mental health modules based on a cognitive 
behavioral therapy clinical model. The findings were also compared with those of 
employee users.
METHODS: Archival operational data from Learn to Live were extracted for student 
users at 4 colleges and universities in the Midwest region of the United States 
(N=951). The inclusion criteria were having clinical symptoms at established 
levels of moderate or higher severity and the use of 2 or more of the 8 lessons 
of a program within a 6-month period. Unique users in each program included 347 
for depression; 325 for stress, anxiety, and worry; 203 for social anxiety; and 
76 for insomnia. Paired t tests (two-tailed) compared the average level of 
change over time on a standardized measure of clinical symptoms appropriate to 
each program. Cohen d statistical effect sizes were calculated for each program. 
Potential moderator factors (age, gender, preliminary comprehensive assessment, 
number of lessons, duration, live coach support, and live teammate support) were 
tested together in repeated measures analysis of variance models with covariates 
in the full sample. Follow-up survey data (n=136) were also collected to explore 
user satisfaction and outcomes. Select data from another study of the same 4 
programs by employee users meeting the same criteria (N=707) were examined for 
comparison.
RESULTS: The percentage of users who improved to a clinical status of no longer 
being at risk after program use was as follows: stress, anxiety, and worry 
program (149/325, 45.8%); insomnia program (33/76, 43.4%), depression program 
(124/347, 35.7%); and social anxiety program (45/203, 22.2%). Significant 
improvements (all P<.001) over time were found in the mean scores for the 
clinical measures for each program: stress, anxiety, and worry (t324=16.21; 
d=1.25); insomnia (t75=6.85; d=1.10); depression (t346=12.71; d=0.91); and 
social anxiety (t202=8.33; d=0.80). Tests of the moderating factors across 
programs indicated that greater improvement was strongly associated with the use 
of more lessons and it also differed by program, by gender (males demonstrated 
more improvement than females), and by the use of live support (particularly 
coaching). Analyses of survey data found high satisfaction, improved academic 
outcomes, and successful integration into the university counseling ecosystem. 
The operational profile and outcomes of the college students were also similar 
to those of employee users of the same programs from our other study of employee 
users. Thus, this study provides a replication.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-directed internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy mental 
health modules are promising as a supplement to traditional in-person counseling 
services provided by college counseling centers.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous randomized controlled trials have evaluated the outcomes 
of internet-delivered psychological pain management programs (PMPs) as a way of 
increasing access to care for people with chronic pain. However, there are few 
reports of the effectiveness of these PMPs when provided as part of routine 
care.
METHODS: The present study sought to report the clinical and demographic 
characteristics of users (n = 1367) and examine the effectiveness of an 
established internet-delivered psychological PMP program in improving several 
pain-related outcomes, when offered at a national digital mental health service 
over a 5-year period. It also sought to comprehensively explore predictors of 
treatment commencement, treatment completion, and clinical improvement.
RESULTS: Evidence of clinical improvements (% improvement; Hedges g) were found 
for all outcomes, including pain interference (18.9%; 0.55), depression (26.1%; 
0.50), anxiety (23.9%; 0.39), pain intensity (12.8%; 0.41), pain self-efficacy 
(-23.8%; -0.46) and pain-catastrophizing (26.3%; 0.56). A small proportion of 
users enrolled but did not commence treatment (13%), however high levels of 
treatment completion (whole treatment = 63%; majority of the treatment = 75%) 
and satisfaction (very satisfied = 45%; satisfied = 37%) were observed among 
those who commenced treatment. There were a number of demographic and clinical 
factors associated with commencement, completion and improvement, but no 
decisive or dominant predictors were observed.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the effectiveness and acceptability of 
internet-delivered psychological PMPs in routine care and point to the need to 
consider how best to integrate these interventions into the pathways of care for 
people with chronic pain.

OBJECTIVES: Digital therapies such as internet-delivered cognitive behaviour 
therapy (ICBT) can improve treatment access for patients with common mental 
disorders, but are rarely used in the Improving Access to Psychological 
Therapies (IAPT) programme in the United Kingdom. The objective of this study 
was to evaluate an evidence-based ICBT intervention for obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD-NET) in three IAPT services in an open trial.
METHODS: Consecutively referred patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD 
(n = 474) were offered OCD-NET. Symptoms of OCD, depression, anxiety, and level 
of functioning were measured weekly throughout treatment.
RESULTS: In the full intention to treat sample (n = 474), the intervention was 
associated with large reductions in self-reported OCD symptoms (d = 1.77), 
anxiety (d = 1.55) and depression (d = 0.8), as well as improvements in 
functional impairment (d = 0.51 to 0.72). Further, 35% of participants were in 
recovery at their last assessment, 25% achieved reliable improvement and 15% met 
criteria for both recovery and improvement. Among participants completing at 
least 4 modules (n = 261), corresponding to an adequate 'dose' of treatment, the 
rates of recovery (44%), reliable improvement (34%) and reliable recovery (21%) 
were higher. A majority of participants were satisfied with the online treatment 
and found the online materials helpful.
CONCLUSIONS: OCD-NET is an effective treatment when delivered in regular care 
within the IAPT system. Challenges associated with implementing ICBT in regular 
health care are discussed.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks 
the central nervous system, causing inflammation and neurodegeneration. People 
living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this 
process, including many "invisible" symptoms that are internally manifested and 
not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a 
companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern 
due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. 
In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside 
perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the 
common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as 
depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and 
suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased 
stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, 
which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, 
routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when 
needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood 
that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. 
Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be 
implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. 
Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps 
for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an 
integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of 
medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and 
self-management techniques for optimal mental health care.

BackgroundDigital mental health services (DMHS) providing psychological 
treatment via the internet were developed to address the huge unmet need for 
evidence-based care for high prevalence psychiatric disorders.AimTo review some 
of the scientific insights derived from data provided by a high volume DMHS 
delivering psychological services as part of routine care.MethodA summary of 
results derived from demographic information and validated symptom self-report 
scales from very large samples of patients.ResultsThe main findings were (1) 
anxiety and depression are often part of the same condition and respond to the 
same treatment, (2) iCBT is effective for mood symptoms, regardless of cause, 
(3) iCBT works just as well for men and for women and (4) chronic pain is a 
symptom that is amenable to psychological treatment delivered via the internet. 
We identified five core behaviours required to maintain good mental health. We 
also found that psychological assessment and treatment provided remotely was 
relatively safe.ConclusionsDMHS are accessible, effective, efficient and 
relatively safe. As well as supporting quality control and service evaluation, 
the routine measurement of outcomes by DMHS has improved our understanding of 
the nature of common mental disorders.

There has been limited research on improving Internet-delivered Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) in routine online therapy clinics that serve people 
from diverse ethnocultural groups (PDEGs). This article describes a 
patient-oriented adaptation approach used to address this gap in research. A 
working group consisting of people with lived experience, community 
representatives, ICBT clinicians, managers, and researchers was formed. The 
working group examined archival feedback on ICBT from past patients who 
self-identified as being from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds (N = 278) and 
the results of interviews with current patients (N = 16), community 
representatives (N = 6), and clinicians (N = 3). The archival data and 
interviews revealed the majority of the patients reported being satisfied with 
and benefitting from ICBT. Suggestions for improvement were not related to the 
cognitive-behavioural model and techniques, but rather to making treatment 
materials more inclusive. Consequently, the ICBT adaptation focused on adding 
content related to cultural influences on mental health, addressing stigma, 
diversifying case stories, examples, and imagery, adding audiovisual 
introductions, and replacing English idioms with more descriptive language. 
Moreover, further training was offered to clinicians, and efforts were made to 
improve community outreach. This study demonstrates a process for using 
patient-oriented research to improve ICBT within routine care serving patients 
of diverse backgrounds.

BACKGROUND: Around 5.8% of adolescents and 2.8% of young adults have an 
Internet-related disorder. These figures underline the widespread concerns in 
our society regarding the potential dangers and risks associated with Internet 
and digital media use.
METHODS: Selective literature search for records on Internet-related disorders 
in children and adolescents.
RESULTS: Internet-related disorders are now viewed as belonging to the 
behavioral addiction. Research has revealed similarities to substance-related 
disorders. There are often associations with other mental illnesses such as 
depression, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality 
disorders, as well as disturbed sleep patterns, increased risk taking, nicotine 
abuse, an unbalanced diet, and lack of exercise. Female adolescents are 
statistically significantly more often affected than male adolescents (7.1% 
versus 4.5%). The German STICA study, the first randomized controlled trial 
worldwide, demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy was effective compared 
with a waiting group (odds ratio 10.10, 95% confidence interval [3.69; 27.65]).
CONCLUSION: Internet-related disorders have not yet been conclusively 
conceptualized and operationalized. Further work is urgently required to refine 
the concepts of both the illness and and its treatment.

Despite its effectiveness, limited research has examined the provision of 
telemental health (TMH) and how practices may vary according to treatment 
paradigm. We surveyed 276 community mental health providers registered with a 
commercial telemedicine platform. Most providers reported primarily offering TMH 
services to adults with anxiety, depression, and trauma-and stressor-related 
disorders in individual therapy formats. Approximately 82% of TMH providers 
reported endorsing the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in their remote 
practice. The most commonly used in-session and between-session (i.e., homework) 
exercises included coping and emotion regulation, problem solving, mindfulness, 
interpersonal skills, relaxation, and modifying and addressing core beliefs. CBT 
TMH providers had a higher odds of using in-session and homework exercises and 
assigning them through postal mail, email or fax methods, as compared to non-CBT 
TMH providers. TMH providers, regardless of treatment paradigm, felt that 
assigning homework was neither easy nor difficult and they believed their 
patients were somewhat-to-moderately compliant to their assigned exercises. CBT 
TMH providers also collected clinical information from their patients more often 
than non-CBT TMH providers. They reported being less satisfied with their 
method, which was identified most often as paper-based surveys and forms. 
Overall, TMH providers employ evidence-based treatments to their patients 
remotely, with CBT TMH providers most likely to do so. Findings highlight the 
need for innovative solutions to improve how TMH providers that endorse 
following the CBT treatment paradigm remotely assign homework and collect 
clinical data to increase their satisfaction via telemedicine.

Emotion dysregulation frequently co-occurs with chronic pain, which in turn 
leads to heightened emotional and physical suffering. This cycle of association 
has prompted a recommendation for psychological treatment of chronic pain to 
target mechanisms for emotion regulation. The current trial addressed this need 
by investigating a new internet-delivered treatment incorporating emotional 
skills training from dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). Using a single-case 
experimental design that is suited to heterogeneous populations and can 
demonstrate efficacy with a small sample, three participants with chronic pain 
were recruited. Participants received four weeks of online DBT skills training 
(iDBT-Pain intervention) which incorporated one-on-one sessions over Zoom and a 
web app. Results revealed compelling evidence for the intervention on the 
primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and were promising for the secondary 
outcome of pain intensity. Improvement was also identified on pre-and 
post-measures of depression, coping behaviors, sleep problems, wellbeing, and 
harm avoidance, indicating that the intervention may positively influence other 
factors related to chronic pain. Overall, the trial provides preliminary 
efficacy for the intervention to improve chronic pain. However, we recommend 
further investigation of the iDBT-Pain intervention, either in single case 
trials, which when conducted with scientific rigor may be aggregated to derive 
nomothetic conclusions, or in a group-comparison trial to compare with usual 
modes of treatment. PERSPECTIVE: This trial advances understanding of 
emotion-focused treatment for chronic pain and provides evidence for a viable 
new technological treatment. Importantly, as an internet-delivered approach, the 
iDBT-Pain intervention is accessible to those with restricted mobility and 
remote communities where there are often limited psychological services for 
people with chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors represent one of the fastest growing populations in 
the United States. Unfortunately, nearly 1 in 3 survivors experience anxiety 
symptoms as a long-term consequence of cancer and its treatment. Characterized 
by restlessness, muscle tension, and worry, anxiety worsens the quality of life; 
impairs daily functioning; and is associated with poor sleep, depressed mood, 
and fatigue. Although pharmacological treatment options are available, 
polypharmacy has become a growing concern for cancer survivors. Music therapy 
(MT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are evidence-based, 
nonpharmacological treatments that have demonstrated effectiveness in treating 
anxiety symptoms in cancer populations and can be adapted for remote delivery to 
increase access to mental health treatments. However, the comparative 
effectiveness of these 2 interventions delivered via telehealth is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of the Music Therapy Versus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
Cancer-related Anxiety (MELODY) study are to determine the comparative 
effectiveness of telehealth-based MT versus telehealth-based CBT for anxiety and 
comorbid symptoms in cancer survivors and to identify patient-level factors 
associated with greater anxiety symptom reduction for MT and CBT.
METHODS: The MELODY study is a 2-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial 
that aims to compare the effectiveness of MT versus CBT for anxiety and comorbid 
symptoms. The trial will enroll 300 English- or Spanish-speaking survivors of 
any cancer type or stage who have experienced anxiety symptoms for at least 1 
month. Participants will receive 7 weekly sessions of MT or CBT delivered 
remotely via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) over 7 weeks. Validated 
instruments to assess anxiety (primary outcome), comorbid symptoms (fatigue, 
depression, insomnia, pain, and cognitive dysfunction), and health-related 
quality of life will be administered at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 (end of 
treatment), 16, and 26. Semistructured interviews will be conducted at week 8 
with a subsample of 60 participants (30 per treatment arm) to understand 
individual experiences with the treatment sessions and their impact.
RESULTS: The first study participant was enrolled in February 2022. As of 
January 2023, 151 participants have been enrolled. The trial is expected to be 
completed by September 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first and largest randomized clinical trial to 
compare the short- and long-term effectiveness of remotely delivered MT and CBT 
for anxiety in cancer survivors. Limitations include the lack of usual care or 
placebo control groups and the lack of formal diagnostic assessments for 
psychiatric disorders among trial participants. The study findings will help 
guide treatment decisions for 2 evidence-based, scalable, and accessible 
interventions to promote mental well-being during cancer survivorship.

OBJECTIVE: Self-help programs are recommended as a first step in the management 
of eating disorders. Yet, whether self-help interventions have broader mental 
health benefits beyond symptom and risk reduction remains unclear. As randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) also assess general mental health secondary to eating 
disorder symptoms, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether and to 
what extent pure self-help interventions for eating disorders produce 
improvements in these secondary outcomes.
METHOD: Twenty-seven RCTs of pure self-help interventions for the prevention or 
treatment of eating disorders were included. Mean age ranged from 16 to 
46 years. Most self-help interventions were based on cognitive-behavioral 
therapy. Most interventions were delivered via digital means (Internet, apps, 
etc.). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on six outcomes: depression, 
anxiety, general distress, quality of life, self-esteem, and psychosocial 
impairment. Analyses were stratified based on pre-selected (at risk/symptomatic) 
and clinical samples.
RESULTS: For pre-selected samples (k = 18), significant pooled effects favoring 
self-help over controls were observed for depression (g = 0.24), anxiety 
(g = 0.23), distress (g = 0.23) and self-esteem (g = 0.18). Effects remained 
robust when adjusting for risk of bias. Non-significant effects were observed 
for quality of life and impairment. Crucially, > 80% of trials on pre-selected 
samples delivered a waitlist control. For clinical samples (k = 9), significant 
pooled effects favoring self-help were found for distress (g = 0.39), impairment 
(g = 0.39), and quality of life (g = 0.29), although these results should be 
interpreted with caution as the number of studies was low.
CONCLUSION: Self-help interventions produce small improvements in those mental 
health symptoms that are typically comorbid with eating disorders.

OBJECTIVES: To outline the planning, development and optimisation of a 
psycho-educational behavioural intervention for patients on active surveillance 
for prostate cancer. The intervention aimed to support men manage active 
surveillance-related psychological distress.
METHODS: The person-based approach (PBA) was used as the overarching guiding 
methodological framework for intervention development. Evidence-based methods 
were incorporated to improve robustness. The process commenced with data 
gathering activities comprising the following four components: • A systematic 
review and meta-analysis of depression and anxiety in prostate cancer • A 
cross-sectional survey on depression and anxiety in active surveillance • A 
review of existing interventions in the field • A qualitative study with the 
target audience The purpose of this paper is to bring these components together 
and describe how they facilitated the establishment of key guiding principles 
and a logic model, which underpinned the first draft of the intervention.
RESULTS: The prototype intervention, named PROACTIVE, consists of six 
Internet-based sessions run concurrently with three group support sessions. The 
sessions cover the following topics: lifestyle (diet and exercise), relaxation 
and resilience techniques, talking to friends and family, thoughts and feelings, 
daily life (money and work) and information about prostate cancer and active 
surveillance. The resulting intervention has been trialled in a feasibility 
study, the results of which are published elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: The planning and development process is key to successful delivery 
of an appropriate, accessible and acceptable intervention. The PBA strengthened 
the intervention by drawing on target-user experiences to maximise acceptability 
and user engagement. This meticulous description in a clinical setting using 
this rigorous but flexible method is a useful demonstration for others 
developing similar interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION AND ETHICAL APPROVAL:

BACKGROUND: We conducted the first non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial 
to determine whether lifestyle therapy is non-inferior to psychotherapy with 
respect to mental health outcomes and costs when delivered via online 
videoconferencing.
METHODS: An individually randomised, group treatment design with 
computer-generated block randomisation was used. Between May 2021-April 2022, 
182 adults with a Distress Questionnaire-5 score = ≥8 (indicative depression) 
were recruited from a tertiary mental health service in regional Victoria, 
Australia and surrounds. Participants were assigned to six 90-min sessions over 
8-weeks using group-based, online videoconferencing comprising: (1) lifestyle 
therapy (targeting nutrition, physical activity) with a dietitian and exercise 
physiologist (n = 91) or (2) psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) with 
psychologists (n = 91). The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9) depression at 8-weeks (non-inferiority margin ≤2) using Generalised 
Estimating Equations (GEE). Cost-minimisation analysis estimated the mean 
difference in total costs from health sector and societal perspectives. Outcomes 
were assessed by blinded research assistants using Computer Assisted Telephone 
Interviews. Results are presented per-protocol (PP) and Intention to Treat (ITT) 
using beta coefficients with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs).
FINDINGS: The sample was 80% women (mean: 45-years [SD:13.4], mean PHQ-9:10.5 
[SD:5.7]. An average 4.2 of 6 sessions were completed, with complete data for 
n = 132. Over 8-weeks, depression reduced in both arms (PP: Lifestyle (n = 70) 
mean difference:-3.97, 95% CIs:-5.10, -2.84; and Psychotherapy (n = 62): mean 
difference:-3.74, 95% CIs:-5.12, -2.37; ITT: Lifestyle (n = 91) mean 
difference:-4.42, 95% CIs: -4.59, -4.25; Psychotherapy (n = 91) mean 
difference:-3.82, 95% CIs:-4.05, -3.69) with evidence of non-inferiority (PP GEE 
β:-0.59; 95% CIs:-1.87, 0.70, n = 132; ITT GEE β:-0.49, 95% CIs:-1.73, 0.75, 
n = 182). Three serious adverse events were recorded. While lifestyle therapy 
was delivered at lower cost, there were no differences in total costs (health 
sector adjusted mean difference: PP AUD$156 [95% CIs -$182, $611, ITT AUD$190 
[95% CIs -$155, $651] ]; societal adjusted mean difference: PP AUD$350 [95% 
CIs:-$222, $1152] ITT AUD$ 408 [95% CIs -$139, $1157].
INTERPRETATION: Remote-delivered lifestyle therapy was non-inferior to 
psychotherapy with respect to clinical and cost outcomes. If replicated in a 
fully powered RCT, this approach could increase access to allied health 
professionals who, with adequate training and guidelines, can deliver mental 
healthcare at comparable cost to psychologists.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard of 
psychotherapy for psychiatric disorders. However, the format of delivering CBT 
in person limits access to the intervention. The advancements in information and 
communication technology, especially the internet, present an opportunity for 
cognitive behavioral therapists to service patients or clients in remote areas 
through videoconferencing. Although many randomized controlled trials of 
videoconference-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (VCBT) have already been 
conducted, the overall estimated effect size of VCBT for psychiatric disorders 
has not been examined by systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of VCBT for 
psychiatric disorders through a systematic and meta-analytic review.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in which VCBT was 
directly compared to control groups (such as treatment as usual, attention 
control, wait-list control, and other minimal supports) was carried out. To 
identify previous studies that meet our study objective, 2 independent reviewers 
undertook a systematic search through seven databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web 
of Science, Science Direct, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and SciELO. Other 
databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Resister of Controlled 
Trials) were also checked. All studies included in the review were assessed 
using the quality criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. Statistical analysis 
was performed by using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4.0). 
Standardized mean difference was used in major meta-analyses where a P value of 
.05 or less was the threshold for statistical significance. A heterogeneity test 
and the chi-square test were performed to assess the presence and extent of 
statistical heterogeneity with significance set at P<.10. Funnel plots were 
visually inspected to assess the risk of bias. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
for each disorder to estimate intervention effects.
RESULTS: The systematic search resulted in 16 studies (total N=1745) that met 
the criteria for this study and were included in the review. There were 10 
studies on depressive symptoms, 3 on chronic pain, 1 on generalized anxiety 
disorder, 1 on obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 1 on hypochondriasis. The 
quality and risk of bias was also assessed. Results showed a pooled effect size 
(Hedge g) post treatment of -0.49 (95% CI -0.68 to -0.29), indicating that VCBT 
is effective for clients with psychiatric disorders. Study quality did not 
affect outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: While the overall results indicate the effectiveness of VCBT, there 
are still only a limited number of studies on specific psychiatric and somatic 
conditions. Therefore, more randomized controlled trials are needed to establish 
the effectiveness of VCBT for different disorders.

BACKGROUND: Self-help cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a useful approach for 
the treatment of psychological problems. Recent research on the effectiveness of 
self-help internet-based CBT (ICBT) indicates that the paradigm moderately 
improves psychological problems. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that 
food and drinks containing supplements improve various health conditions. We 
investigated the effect of a brief self-help ICBT administered with a supplement 
drink on psychological well-being and somatic symptoms.
METHODS: In total, 101 healthy workers were enrolled in the 4-week ICBT program, 
which consisted of psychoeducation on stress management, behavior activation, 
and cognitive restructuring. The supplement soft drink was taken every day 
during the program. The participants were instructed to watch on-demand video 
clips and read the self-help guidebook and supporting comic strip weekly on the 
Internet or smartphone. The Japanese version of the Profile of Mood States 
(POMS) was administered before and after completion of the program. Scores on 
the POMS tension-anxiety (POMS-TA), depression (POMS-D), and fatigue (POMS-F) 
subscales were used to assess the effect of the program. Somatic symptoms were 
assessed using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire.
RESULTS: In total, 75 participants continued the program for 4 weeks; however, 
of those, 27 failed to complete all weekly tasks or meet the post-assessment 
deadlines. Therefore, the data of 48 participants were included in the analysis. 
Pre-post intervention comparisons using paired t-tests revealed significant 
improvement on the POMS-TA, but not the POMS-D or POMS-F subscales. Moreover, 
participants reported a significant reduction in the severity of low back pain.
CONCLUSION: Our brief intervention moderately improved anxiety levels and the 
symptom of low back pain. These findings suggest that the brief ICBT program is 
effective in non-patient populations. Future directions for brief ICBT are 
discussed.

Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the 
benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through 
various media, including Internet interventions, mobile apps, and video games. 
BITs present several possible benefits, including increased dissemination and 
accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, and decreased stigma, 
especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot, Tess, addresses different 
facets of behavioral health, such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7, 
Tess delivers customized integrative support, psychoeducation, and interventions 
through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e., SMS text 
messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of 
integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23; Mage = 
15.20 years; Rangeage = 9.78-18.54 years; 57% female) coping with weight 
management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred 
method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to 
promote treatment adherence, behavior change, and overall wellness. Adolescent 
patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the 
time. The 4,123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings 
(96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this 
chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of 
support through artificial intelligence, specifically in a pediatric setting, 
which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to 
clinicians, Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours 
while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous 
learning, future iterations may have additional features to increase the user 
experience.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global mental health. 
E-mental health has the potential to enhance the quality of care and can be 
swiftly implemented on a large scale. We performed a systematic review of 
systematic reviews, including meta-analyses, to assess the effects of COVID-19 
e-mental health interventions. We followed an established search, screening, 
coding, and reporting protocol. Methodological quality was evaluated using the 
Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) checklist. The searches 
resulted in a total of 2341 articles. Of these, twelve systematic and 
meta-analytic reviews were included. The findings indicated that cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation were the most used mental health 
intervention types. E-mental health interventions were delivered via various 
communication channels including videoconferencing, telephone-based approaches, 
and mobile applications. E-mental health interventions have demonstrated their 
effectiveness in addressing prevalent mental health issues, particularly 
anxiety, depression, and stress. This study underscores the importance of 
e-mental health interventions in enhancing accessibility and efficiency to 
reduce mental health symptoms, providing valuable insights for policymakers and 
clinicians addressing mental health challenges exacerbated by global pandemics.

The sleep of millions has suffered during the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
Prevalence rates of 20-45% are reported globally for insomnia symptoms during 
the pandemic. Affected populations include the public and health care workers. A 
sleep deprived society faces the increased burden of COVID-related economic 
disruption, psychosocial problems, substance abuse, and suicide. Disordered 
sleep is not expected to disappear with control of infection, making 
interventions acutely necessary. The question becomes how to manage the sleep 
dysfunction during and after the pandemic. Depression and anxiety are prominent 
complaints during pandemic restrictions. Insomnia symptoms and fatigue continue 
even as mood improves in those who are in recovery from COVID-19 infection. 
Management of disturbed sleep and mental health is particularly needed in 
frontline health care workers. This overview describes 53 publications, as of 
February 2021, on disturbed sleep during the pandemic, treatment studies on 
COVID-related sleep disturbance, and need to rely on current treatment 
guidelines for common sleep disorders. The available research during the first 
year of COVID-19 has generally described symptoms of poor sleep rather than 
addressing treatment strategies. It covers digital cognitive behavioral therapy 
for insomnia (CBT-i) for the public and frontline workers, recognizing the need 
of greater acceptance and efficacy of controlled trials of CBT for affected 
groups. Recommendations based on a tiered public health model are discussed.

Loneliness has been described as a common source of discomfort based on a 
subjective discrepancy between the actual and desired social situation. For some 
people this feeling may become a sustained state that is associated with a wide 
range of psychiatric and psychosocial problems. While there are few existing 
treatment protocols, interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
have shown positive effects. The current study investigated the efficacy of an 
8-week internet-based treatment containing CBT components aimed at reducing 
feelings of loneliness. Seventy-three participants were recruited from the 
general public and randomly allocated to treatment or a wait-list control 
condition. Participants were assessed with standardized self-report measures of 
loneliness, depression, social anxiety, worry, and quality of life at 
pretreatment and posttreatment. Robust linear regression analysis of all 
randomized participants showed significant treatment effects on the primary 
outcome measure of loneliness (between group Cohen's d = 0.77), and on secondary 
outcomes measuring quality of life and social anxiety relative to control at 
postassessment. The results suggest the potential utility of internet-based CBT 
in alleviating loneliness but more research on the long-term effects and the 
mechanisms underlying the effects is needed.

BACKGROUND: While the acquisition and application of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy 
(CBT) skills is a core component and likely mechanism of effect maintenance in 
all CBT-based treatments, the extent of post-therapeutic CBT skills usage among 
internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) clients remains under-researched.
METHOD: Nested within a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, 241 participants 
received an 8-week supported iCBT intervention for anxiety and/or depression and 
answered open-ended questions about their use and experience of CBT skills at 
3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up. Recurrent, cross-sectional qualitative 
analysis following the descriptive and interpretive approach was used to create 
a taxonomy, through which all qualitative data was coded.
RESULTS: In total, 479 qualitative responses across 181 participants were 
analysed. Participants reported using a wide range of CBT skills and associated 
helpful and hindering experiences and impacts. The reasons for discontinued CBT 
skills usage were diverse, ranging from rare adverse effects to healthy 
adaptation.
CONCLUSION: The study shows how clients receiving iCBT in routine care learn CBT 
skills during treatment and utilize them in productive ways post-treatment. 
Findings coincide with similar research in face-to-face CBT and may inform 
future research to drive innovation and iCBT intervention development.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is 
an effective treatment for insomnia. However, less is known about mediators of 
its benefits. The aim of the present study was to test if intraindividual 
variability in sleep (IIV) was reduced with dCBT-I, and whether any identified 
reduction was a mediator of dCBT-I on insomnia severity and psychological 
distress.
METHODS: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), 1720 adults with 
insomnia (dCBT-I = 867; patient education about sleep = 853) completed the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
and sleep diaries, at baseline and 9-week follow-up. Changes in IIV were 
analyzed using linear mixed modeling followed by mediation analyses of ISI, 
HADS, and IIV in singular sleep metrics and composite measures (behavioral 
indices (BI-Z) and sleep disturbance indices (SI-Z)).
RESULTS: dCBT-I was associated with reduced IIV across all singular sleep 
metrics, with the largest between-group effect sizes observed for sleep onset 
latency (SOL). Reduced IIV for SOL and wake after sleep onset had the overall 
greatest singular mediating effect. For composite measures, SI-Z mediated change 
in ISI (b = -0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.04 to -0.52; 13.3%) and HADS 
(b = -0.40; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.18; 29.2%), while BI-Z mediated minor changes.
CONCLUSION: Reductions in IIV in key sleep metrics mediate significant changes 
in insomnia severity and especially psychological distress when using dCBT-I. 
These findings offer important evidence regarding the therapeutic action of 
dCBT-I and may guide the future development of this intervention.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer treatment completion can be a period of 
vulnerability for parents and is associated with mental health difficulties such 
as depression and anxiety. We developed an internet-administered, guided, 
low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy-based self-help intervention (EJDeR) 
for parents delivered on the U-CARE-portal (Portal). The acceptability and 
feasibility of EJDeR and study procedures were examined using a single-arm 
feasibility trial (ENGAGE). Results indicated that EJDeR and ENGAGE study 
procedures are acceptable and feasible, however, a need for clinical and 
technical modifications to EJDeR and refinements to ENGAGE study procedures was 
identified.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of 
EJDeR and ENGAGE study procedures from the perspective of e-therapists to inform 
clinical and technical modifications to EJDeR and refinements to study 
procedures prior to progression to a superiority randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 e-therapists. Data were 
analysed using manifest content analysis.
RESULTS: We identified three categories relating to the acceptability and 
feasibility of EJDeR: (a) Support to e-therapists (subcategories: Clinical 
supervision and Technical difficulties); (b) Guidance to parents (subcategories: 
Support protocols and Synchronous communication); and (c) Content 
(subcategories: Relevancy of the intervention and Pacing of the intervention). 
We identified four categories relating to the acceptability and feasibility of 
study procedures: (a) Recruitment and training of e-therapists (subcategories: 
Definition of the role and Training program); (b) Retention of parents 
(subcategories: Parent suitability and screening and Frequency of weekly Portal 
assessments); (c) Retention of e-therapists (subcategories: Administrative 
requirements and Communication with the research team); and (d) The Portal.
CONCLUSIONS: EJDeR and study procedures were considered acceptable and feasible, 
however, clinical and technical modifications and refinements to study 
procedures were suggested to enhance acceptability and feasibility. Results may 
also inform implementation considerations for both EJDeR and other similar 
digital psychological interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Prevention of eating disorders (EDs) is of high importance. However, 
digital programs with human moderation are unlikely to be disseminated widely. 
The aim of this study was to test whether a chatbot (i.e., computer program 
simulating human conversation) would significantly reduce ED risk factors (i.e., 
weight/shape concerns, thin-ideal internalization) in women at high risk for an 
ED, compared to waitlist control, as well as whether it would significantly 
reduce overall ED psychopathology, depression, and anxiety and prevent ED onset.
METHOD: Women who screened as high risk for an ED were randomized (N = 700) to 
(1) chatbot based on the StudentBodies© program; or (2) waitlist control. 
Participants were followed for 6 months.
RESULTS: For weight/shape concerns, there was a significantly greater reduction 
in intervention versus control at 3- (d = -0.20; p = .03) and 6-m-follow-up 
(d = -0.19; p = .04). There were no differences in change in thin-ideal 
internalization. The intervention was associated with significantly greater 
reductions than control in overall ED psychopathology at 3- (d = -0.29; 
p = .003) but not 6-month follow-up. There were no differences in change in 
depression or anxiety. The odds of remaining nonclinical for EDs were 
significantly higher in intervention versus control at both 3- (OR = 2.37, 95% 
CI [1.37, 4.11]) and 6-month follow-ups (OR = 2.13, 95% CI [1.26, 3.59]).
DISCUSSION: Findings provide support for the use of a chatbot-based EDs 
prevention program in reducing weight/shape concerns through 6-month follow-up, 
as well as in reducing overall ED psychopathology, at least in the shorter-term. 
Results also suggest the intervention may reduce ED onset.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: We found that a chatbot, or a computer program simulating 
human conversation, based on an established, cognitive-behavioral therapy-based 
eating disorders prevention program, was successful in reducing women's concerns 
about weight and shape through 6-month follow-up and that it may actually reduce 
eating disorder onset. These findings are important because this intervention, 
which uses a rather simple text-based approach, can easily be disseminated in 
order to prevent these deadly illnesses.

reduction in nurses with insomnia: a non-inferiority internet delivered 
randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a highly prevalent sleep disorder frequently comorbid 
with mental health conditions in nurses. Despite the effectiveness of 
evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), there is a 
critical need for alternative approaches. This study investigated whether 
internet-delivered mindfulness-based stress reduction (IMBSR) for insomnia could 
be an alternative to internet-delivered CBT-I (ICBT-I).
OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was that the IMBSR would be noninferior to the ICBT-I 
in reducing the severity of insomnia among nurses with insomnia. Additionally, 
it was expected that ICBT-I would produce a greater reduction in the severity of 
insomnia and depression than IMBSR.
METHOD: Among 240 screened nurses, 134 with insomnia were randomly allocated 
(IMBSR, n = 67; ICBT-I, n = 67). The assessment protocol comprised clinical 
interviews and self-reported outcome measures, including the Insomnia Severity 
Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the 15-item Five Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 
(CSQ-I).
RESULTS: The retention rate was 55% with 77.6% (n = 104) of participants 
completing the study. At post-intervention, the noninferiority analysis of the 
ISI score showed that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was 4.88 
(P = 0.46), surpassing the pre-specified noninferiority margin of 4 points. 
Analysis of covariance revealed that the ICBT-I group had significantly lower 
ISI (Cohen's d = 1.37) and PHQ-9 (Cohen's d = 0.71) scores than did the IMBSR 
group. In contrast, the IMBSR group showed a statistically significant increase 
in the FFMQ-15 score (Cohen's d = 0.67). Within-group differences showed that 
both the IMBSR and ICBT-I were effective at reducing insomnia severity and 
depression severity and improving mindfulness.
CONCLUSION: Overall, nurses demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and 
adherence to both interventions. The IMBSR significantly reduced insomnia 
severity and depression, but the findings of this study do not provide strong 
evidence that the IMBSR is at least as effective as the ICBT-I in reducing 
insomnia symptoms among nurses with insomnia. The ICBT-I was found to be 
significantly superior to the IMBSR in reducing insomnia severity, making it a 
recommended treatment option for nurses with insomnia.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain often experience insomnia symptoms. Pain 
initiates, maintains, and exacerbates insomnia symptoms, and vice versa, 
indicating a complex situation with an additional burden for these patients. 
Hence, the evaluation of insomnia-related interventions for patients with 
chronic pain is important.
OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of 
internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (ICBT-i) for reducing 
insomnia severity and other sleep- and pain-related parameters in patients with 
chronic pain. Participants were recruited from the Swedish Quality Registry for 
Pain Rehabilitation.
METHODS: We included 54 patients (mean age 49.3, SD 12.3 years) who were 
randomly assigned to the ICBT-i condition and 24 to an active control condition 
(applied relaxation). Both treatment conditions were delivered via the internet. 
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a sleep diary, and a battery of anxiety, 
depression, and pain-related parameter measurements were assessed at baseline, 
after treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up (only ISI, anxiety, depression, and 
pain-related parameters). For the ISI and sleep diary, we also recorded weekly 
measurements during the 5-week treatment. Negative effects were also monitored 
and reported.
RESULTS: Results showed a significant immediate interaction effect (time by 
treatment) on the ISI and other sleep parameters, namely, sleep efficiency, 
sleep onset latency, early morning awakenings, and wake time after sleep onset. 
Participants in the applied relaxation group reported no significant immediate 
improvements, but both groups exhibited a time effect for anxiety and depression 
at the 6-month follow-up. No significant improvements on pain-related parameters 
were found. At the 6-month follow-up, both the ICBT-i and applied relaxation 
groups had similar sleep parameters. For both treatment arms, increased stress 
was the most frequently reported negative effect.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic pain, brief ICBT-i leads to a more rapid 
decline in insomnia symptoms than does applied relaxation. As these results are 
unique, further research is needed to investigate the effect of ICBT-i on a 
larger sample size of people with chronic pain. Using both treatments might lead 
to an even better outcome in patients with comorbid insomnia and chronic pain.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia and anxiety are highly prevalent and frequently 
co-occur. Given limited therapeutic resources and time constraints, the aim of 
this study was to compare which treatment-internet cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) for insomnia or internet CBT for anxiety-leads to the best outcomes in 
individuals with comorbid insomnia and anxiety.
METHODS: 120 participants with comorbid insomnia and clinical anxiety (as 
defined by scores above the clinical cutoff on the insomnia severity index (ISI) 
and the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)) were randomized to 
receive internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for insomnia or iCBT 
for anxiety. The primary outcome measures were the ISI and the generalized 
anxiety disorder 7-item scale. Primary outcome measures were assessed before 
treatment, at mid-treatment, at post-treatment, and 3 months after treatment. 
Secondary outcome measures assessed depression symptoms, distress, and sleep 
diary parameters.
RESULTS: Participants in both groups experienced large reductions in symptoms of 
insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress, as well as improvements in sleep 
efficiency and total sleep time. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. 
Crucially, at the end of treatment, the insomnia treatment was more effective in 
reducing symptoms of insomnia than the anxiety treatment, and equally effective 
in reducing symptoms of anxiety. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month 
follow-up, however, there were no differences between groups at that time point.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in the common case of a patient 
presenting with comorbid insomnia and anxiety, treatment for insomnia may be the 
most efficient treatment strategy.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the long-term outcomes 1-year after 
undertaking an Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus 
distress in a US population. Secondary aims were to identify the effects on 
additional difficulties associate with tinnitus and any unwanted events related 
to ICBT for tinnitus.
METHODS: A repeated-measures design with 4 time points was used. Participants 
previously undertaking two randomized ICBT efficacy trials for tinnitus in the 
US were invited to participate. Of the 200 invited, 132 (66 %) completed the 
1-year follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus 
distress from baseline at one year post-intervention, as assessed by the 
Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary assessment measures were included for 
anxiety, depression, insomnia, hearing disability, hyperacusis, tinnitus 
cognitions and health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: Undertaking ICBT for tinnitus led to significant improvements 1-year 
post-intervention for tinnitus severity, with a large effect size (d = 1.06; CI: 
0.80 to 1.32). Medium effects were found for anxiety (d = 0.54; CI: 0.29 to 
0.79), depression (d = 0.46; CI: 0.21 to 0.70), insomnia (d = 0.47; CI: 0.22 to 
0.72), and tinnitus cognitions (d = 0.43, CI: 0.18 to 0.68). Small effect sizes 
were found for hearing disability, hyperacusis and health-related quality of 
life. Adverse events related to the intervention were only reported by 1 
participant.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of audiologist-guided ICBT for tinnitus and 
tinnitus-related difficulties were maintained 1-year post-intervention with very 
few adverse events reported. Ways of disseminate evidence-based easily 
accessible interventions to the general population with bothersome tinnitus 
should be sought.

INTRODUCTION: Persistent and distressing somatic symptoms are common in younger 
age cohorts such as university students. However, the majority does not receive 
adequate psychosocial care. Internet-based and mobile-based interventions may 
represent low threshold and effective extensions to reduce somatic and 
associated mental symptom severity. The planned study aims to investigate the 
feasibility and efficacy of an internet-based intervention in reducing somatic 
and psychological symptoms in an international population of university students 
with somatic symptom burden.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This parallel two-armed randomised controlled trial 
evaluates an 8-week guided intervention, including web-based consecutive modules 
based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles against a waitlist 
control group. Guidance will be provided by trained psychologists with weekly 
written supportive feedback. As part of the 'Studicare' project, the present 
study aims to recruit n=154 university students indicating somatic symptom 
burden at baseline in German-speaking universities. Self-report assessments will 
take place at baseline and after intervention completion (8, 16 weeks after 
randomisation). The primary outcome will be the severity of somatic symptoms and 
associated mental distress. Secondary outcomes include depression, (health) 
anxiety, disability, intervention satisfaction and adherence.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted. Results from this 
study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international 
conferences.

The coronavirus pandemic led to worldwide disruption in the delivery of 
face-to-face mental health services. This impact was marked for individuals with 
long-term health conditions and comorbid depression and anxiety. Many 
face-to-face mental health services switched to remote delivery or paused 
therapeutic input entirely, despite the lack of research on the efficacy of 
switching between modalities mid-therapy or having breaks in therapy. This paper 
presents the case of a patient with long-term health conditions who experienced 
both breaks in therapy and a switch in modalities from face-to-face to telephone 
delivery. The intervention used was based on transdiagnostic cognitive 
behavioral therapy and self-report measures were completed at the beginning and 
end of the twelve sessions. Despite the shift in modalities, the patient 
experienced clinically significant recovery on all measures, indicating the 
efficacy of therapy was not greatly affected by the shift in modalities. Long 
breaks in therapy were linked to deterioration in mental health, although this 
could be due to the deterioration in physical health that necessitated these 
breaks. This case highlights the benefits and challenges of a shifting modality 
of therapy during treatment and in response to a pandemic for a shielding 
population. From the work presented here, it seems beneficial for services to be 
able to work across multiple modalities to suit the needs of the patients and 
ensure continuity of treatment. It also indicates that pauses in therapy may 
risk deterioration. Further work is needed to prevent digital exclusion of 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus is 
an evidence-based intervention, but only available in a few languages. To 
increase accessibility, ICBT was translated into Spanish. This study's objective 
was to determine the feasibility of ICBT for Spanish speakers.
DESIGN: A single-group pre-test post-test design was used. Compliance, 
engagement, acceptance and outcome feasibility were measured.
STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-six Spanish speakers with tinnitus were screened. There were 
32 participants meeting the eligibility criteria, with a mean age of 47 (±11) 
years. Of these 91% were Hispanic or Latino with 66% living in Spain and 34% 
living in South America.
RESULTS: Outcome feasibility was established, as a large pre- and post-test 
within-group effect size of d = 0.90 was found for tinnitus severity. Large pre- 
and post-test effect sizes were also present for the secondary outcomes of 
anxiety and depression with a medium effect for insomnia, health-related quality 
of life, and tinnitus cognitions. Intervention engagement and compliance were 
not optimal although no participants withdrew. Intervention acceptance rates 
indicated scope for improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: ICBT for Spanish communities appears to be feasible. A randomised 
controlled trial is required to further investigate the effects and identify 
ways of improving engagement and attracting Spanish speakers from different 
countries.

BACKGROUND: Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP) is effective in improving 
meaning in life, hope, optimism, self-efficacy, well-being, and quality of life, 
and in reducing stress in people with cancer. However, all the studies on the 
application of MCP in cancer patients have been carried out in Anglo-Saxon 
samples. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt and verify the efficacy of MCP in 
populations that speak languages other than English, such as Spanish. Moreover, 
to expand the data supporting the efficacy of MCP for cancer patients, it would 
be necessary to compare MCP to other active therapies such as Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
METHODS: The aims of the proposed study are: the first objective is to verify 
the efficacy of the MCP intervention for Spanish participants with cancer in a 
randomized control trial (RCT) comparing it to CBT. The second objective is to 
analyze the feasibility and acceptance of MCP in Spanish participants with 
cancer. The third objective is to analyze whether the changes produced in the 
meaning in life dimensions (presence, search, comprehension, purpose, and 
mattering) will predict changes in anxiety, depression, quality of life, etc. 
Our research team adapted MCP for Spanish participants with cancer. This paper 
presents the study protocol. The study design consists of a two-arm RCT with two 
conditions: MCP and CBT, where participants will be randomized to one of the two 
groups. Eligible participants will be adults with stage I, II, and III cancer 
who were treated with curative intent and had completed their main medical 
treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy). Participants will be 
assessed at pretreatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. The 
intention-to-treat principle will be used when analyzing data, using 
mixed-effects models with full information and maximum likelihood estimation.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide results that confirm the efficacy of the MCP 
in Spanish participants with cancer.

BACKGROUND: Early treatment is critical for improving eating disorder prognosis. 
Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on 
waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to 
access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI 
(Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI 
and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness 
of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered 
by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot's impact on eating disorder pathology, 
psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change 
or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all 
types of eating disorders.
METHODS: This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people 
on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group 
(n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided 
participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while 
the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered 
in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time 
point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month 
after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology 
(primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress 
(secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change 
or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, 
the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention 
group only.
RESULTS: ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the 
control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and 
secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and 
anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate 
effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in 
participants' confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) 
immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The 
chatbot was rated as "excellent" in terms of usability. A significantly higher 
proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment 
by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control 
group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, 
psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 
month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, 
accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years 
waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine 
the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI.

Improving public health approaches to suicide prevention requires scalable 
evidence-based interventions that can be easily disseminated. Given empirical 
data supporting the association between insomnia and suicide risk, 
internet-delivered insomnia interventions are promising candidates to meet this 
need. The purpose of this study was to examine whether an unguided 
internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) improved 
insomnia severity, suicidal ideation (SI), and suicide risk correlates 
(depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, hostility, belongingness, 
hopelessness, agitation, irritability, concentration) in a sample of veterans. 
Secondary data analysis of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
and Operation New Dawn veterans (n = 50) with clinically significant insomnia 
and elevated SI drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an 
iCBT-I, Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi). Two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests were used to evaluate between-group differences (SHUTi vs. 
Insomnia Education Website control) in symptom improvement from baseline to 
post-intervention. SHUTi participants experienced a significant improvement in 
insomnia severity (P < .001; d = -1.08) and a non-significant with small 
(subthreshold medium) effect size reduction of SI (P = .17, d = 0.40), compared 
to control participants. Significant improvement in hopelessness was observed 
(medium effect size), with non-significant small to medium effect size 
reductions in most remaining suicide risk correlates. Self-administered iCBT-I 
was associated with improvements in insomnia severity in veterans at elevated 
risk for suicide. These preliminary findings suggest that SI and suicide risk 
correlates may improve following an iCBT-I intervention, demonstrating the need 
for future well-powered iCBT-I RCTs targeted for populations at elevated suicide 
risk.

Plain Language Summary: In this secondary data analysis, we examined 
improvements in insomnia severity, suicidal ideation (SI), and suicide risk 
correlates in veterans with clinically significant insomnia and elevated SI 
drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining an unguided 
internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I). Veterans 
in the iCBT-I group experienced greater improvements in insomnia severity and 
hopelessness than veterans in the Insomnia Education Website control. Although 
between-group differences in SI and other suicide risk correlates were not 
statistically significant, effect sizes suggest that SI and symptoms of 
depression, irritability, concentration, post-traumatic stress disorder, and 
hostility may improve following iCBT-I intervention. These results suggest that 
digital and iCBT-I interventions may be especially powerful tools for use in 
suicide prevention among veterans but highlight the critical need for additional 
large-scale studies to examine suicide-specific mechanisms and outcomes to guide 
implementation efforts.

BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus is 
an evidence-based intervention. The components of ICBT for tinnitus have, 
however, not been dismantled and thus the effectiveness of the different 
therapeutic components is unknown. It is, furthermore, not known if 
heterogeneous tinnitus subgroups respond differently to ICBT.
AIMS: This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied 
relaxation within ICBT for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities 
associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied 
for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, 
those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression.
METHODS: A parallel randomized controlled trial design (n = 126) was used to 
compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. 
Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were 
completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary 
outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. 
Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative 
tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and 
hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, 
number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an 
intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken.
RESULTS: Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention 
was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation 
resulted in large reduction of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes 
d = 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were 
maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus 
distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences 
(between-group d = 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus 
distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant 
depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to 
significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group 
differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group.
CONCLUSION: Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic 
results were compromised. Further studies employing strategies to improve 
compliance and engagement are required. The intervention's effectiveness 
increased with initial level of tinnitus distress; those with the highest scores 
at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This 
may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger 
samples are needed to confirm this.

987. Workplace Electronic Health Promotion Campaigns for Tobacco Smoking Prevention 
or Cessation [Internet].

Hui D, Mierzwinski-Urban M.

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2021 Feb.
CADTH Health Technology Review.

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of mortality with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease as the main causes of smoking-related mortality., Canadian data from 
2019 (excluding the territories) estimated the daily smoking prevalence rate to 
be more than 5% with 3,160,100 individuals 12 years and older (across both males 
and females) reporting they smoke daily. Individuals who smoke accrue more 
health care costs compared to those who have never smoked, with the accrual 
increasing with age., For example, in Ontario, annual health care costs of an 80 
year old who has never smoked versus an 80 year old who currently smokes were 
estimated to be $8,740 versus $19,583, respectively. In 2012, tobacco use in 
Canada resulted in $16.2 billion dollars in expenses related to health care, 
tobacco control law enforcement, fire damage, and lost production among 
manufacturers and the service industry. In the workplace, smoking may result in 
increased employee absenteeism (e.g., sick leave), as well as presenteeism and 
reduced employee productivity (i.e., being physically present at work but 
mentally distracted resulting in lower productivity). The addictiveness of 
nicotine is the principal barrier to smoking cessation with nicotine withdrawal 
symptoms including restlessness, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, concentration 
difficulties, mood changes (e.g., depression or dysphoria), increased appetite, 
and weight gain. Tobacco smoking cessation is facilitated by pharmacological and 
behavioural interventions. Combination interventions (pharmacological and 
behavioural) have been shown to increase the success of smoking cessation 
compared to single-intervention approaches (e.g., solely relying on 
pharmacological interventions)., Pharmacological interventions administered as 
first-line include nicotine replacement therapy (alternative forms of nicotine, 
such as gum or patches, to relieve withdrawal) and non-nicotine therapy (drugs 
such as varenicline or bupropion)., Behavioural interventions aim to provide 
education or support, or offer techniques to problem solve, cope, and manage 
stress; multiple behavioural interventions may be used simultaneously. 
Behavioural interventions are administered in-person or through electronic or 
technology-based media and may include the following: counselling through 
individual or group sessions conducted in-person or via telephone or videocalls; 
self-help resources in print (e.g., pamphlets) or digital form (e.g., audio, 
video, or PDFs); mobile applications (apps) that offer behavioural change 
techniques or useful information (e.g., pharmacotherapy facts); web-based 
interventions that provide access to tailored and interactive materials; and use 
of text messaging to relay motivational messages, provide positive feedback, and 
facilitate behavioural changes. There has recently been an emergence of EHPCs, 
which aim to promote health and prevent disease by encouraging individuals to 
exercise healthy behaviours and they usually address behavioural risk factors 
such as tobacco use. In the workplace, EHPCs may include knowledge mobilization 
campaigns, strategies, or programs such as awareness messages delivered through 
corporate intranet, social media, emails, text messages, and self-directed 
online programs. For instance, Butt Out is a self-directed online smoking 
cessation program that was developed by the Centre for Addiction and Mental 
Health for individuals who smoke in the Canadian Armed Forces. EHPCs may help to 
promote health and well-being while supporting the prevention or cessation of 
tobacco smoking among employees. Literature has demonstrated the effectiveness 
of non-electronic smoking cessation interventions,,; however, the effectiveness 
of electronic smoking cessation interventions has not been well-studied. 
Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of workplace EHPCs may help to inform 
decision-making regarding their implementation. The purpose of this rapid review 
is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of workplace EHPCs for the prevention or 
cessation of tobacco smoking. This report compliments a CADTH Summary of 
Abstracts report on the cost-effectiveness of workplace EHPCs for substance use, 
gambling, and gaming prevention.

satisfaction and improvements, and meaningful clinical improvements (≥ 30% 
improvement).
RESULTS: Clinical improvements were observed from pre-treatment to 
post-treatment in pain-related disability (32% [95% CI: 29, 34]), depression 
symptoms (44% [95% CI: 39, 49]), anxiety symptoms (43% [95% CI: 39, 47]), and 
average pain intensity (23% [95% CI: 21, 26]), which were maintained to 3-month 
follow-up. High levels of satisfaction and treatment completion were also 
observed. Minor demographic and clinical differences were observed. However, 
there were similar rates of clinical improvement, treatment satisfaction and 
treatment completion in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings further highlight the value of 
internet-delivered psychological PMPs for Australians with chronic pain living 
in regional and remote parts of the country. Further work is needed to raise 
awareness about the availability of these effective programmes and to integrate 
their use with traditional pain management services.

Insomnia has an estimated prevalence of over 20 % in patients with multiple 
sclerosis (MS) and preliminary evidence suggests that treating insomnia through 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can alleviate fatigue and 
other secondary symptoms in this population. Video-based CBT-I, an emerging 
remote treatment modality, has shown promise in previous studies for addressing 
insomnia in various populations, indicating its potential as an efficient 
treatment approach for individuals with MS. This pilot study aimed to assess the 
impact of video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I) on 
individuals with comorbid insomnia and multiple sclerosis (MS). Out of the ten 
participants, six experienced statistically significant reductions in total wake 
time during the night, while seven demonstrated clinically significant 
improvements in waking time, and eight achieved insomnia remission based on the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). These findings align with prior research 
indicating the effectiveness of CBT-I in addressing sleep disturbances and its 
promising potential for insomnia in MS. Moreover, improvements in depression 
symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9, and reductions in worry, as assessed by the 
GAD-7, were observed. Although fatigue outcomes varied, suggesting a potential 
need for optimal sleep duration, participants reported enhanced quality of life 
and high treatment satisfaction. These results suggest that VCBT-I is a 
well-tolerated and effective treatment option for individuals with comorbid MS 
and insomnia, highlighting its potential to alleviate both sleep-related and 
psychological symptoms.

Therapeutic or serious games are considered innovative ways of delivering 
psychological interventions especially suited for children and adolescents, 
which can have a positive impact on mental health, while also being fun and 
easily accessible online. While most serious games for children and adolescents 
address specific issues, such as anxiety or depression, preventive measures 
received less attention. REThink is an online therapeutic game designed as a 
stand-alone prevention tool, aiming to increase resilience in healthy children 
and adolescents in a Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy framework (David et 
al., 2019). The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the validity of 
in-game performance measurements or scores as indicators of the game 
effectiveness in building real life emotion-regulation abilities. We analyzed 
how scores of different game levels (addressing different skills) are associated 
with improvements in mental health and emotion regulation abilities. Our 
preliminary results suggest that in-game performance at some levels (scores) 
consistently reflect improvements in psychological functioning, while in-game 
performance at other levels are less associated with changes in real life 
self-reported psychological functioning. These results offer important 
information about which levels can be used as preliminary indicators of 
psychological improvements, and which levels need to be revised in terms of task 
or scoring. Overall, results of our study offer preliminary validation of 
REThink's game scoring system, while also suggesting the elements to be refined.

BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia affects up to 63% of family dementia caregivers. 
Research suggests that chronic insomnia prompts changes in central stress 
processing that have downstream negative effects on health and mood, as well as 
on cognitive, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative functioning. We hypothesize 
that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) will reverse those 
downstream effects by improving insomnia and restoring healthy central stress 
processing. Rural caregivers are particularly vulnerable, but they have limited 
access to CBT-I; therefore, we developed an accessible digital version using 
community input (NiteCAPP CARES).
OBJECTIVE: This trial will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and 
short-term and long-term effects of NiteCAPP CARES on the sleep and stress 
mechanisms underlying poor caregiver health and functioning.
METHODS: Dyads (n=100) consisting of caregivers with chronic insomnia and their 
coresiding persons with dementia will be recruited from Columbia and surrounding 
areas in Missouri, United States. Participant dyads will be randomized to 4 
weeks (plus 4 bimonthly booster sessions) of NiteCAPP CARES or a web-based sleep 
hygiene control (NiteCAPP SHARES). Participants will be assessed at baseline, 
after treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The following assessments will 
be completed by caregivers: 1 week of actigraphy and daily diaries measuring 
sleep, Insomnia Severity Index, arousal (heart rate variability), inflammation 
(blood-derived biomarkers: interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein), 
neurodegeneration (blood-derived biomarkers: plasma amyloid beta [Aβ40 and 
Aβ42], total tau, and phosphorylated tau [p-tau181 and p-tau217]), cognition 
(Joggle battery, NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral 
Function, and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), stress and burden, health, and 
mood (depression and anxiety). Persons with dementia will complete 1 week of 
actigraphy at each time point.
RESULTS: Recruitment procedures started in February 2022. All data are expected 
to be collected by 2026. Full trial results are planned to be published by 2027. 
Secondary analyses of baseline data will be subsequently published.
CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial tests NiteCAPP CARES, a web-based 
CBT-I for rural caregivers. The knowledge obtained will address not only what 
outcomes improve but also how and why they improve and for how long, which will 
help us to modify NiteCAPP CARES to optimize treatment potency and support 
future pragmatic testing and dissemination.

Acute insomnia is common and a substantial proportion of people with acute 
insomnia (i.e. 3 days to 3 months) transit into chronic insomnia (i.e. 3 months 
or longer). Therefore, early intervention for acute insomnia is vital to prevent 
chronicity. Previous trials with small sample sizes have shown that brief 
versions of both individual and group-based face-to-face cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can improve insomnia symptoms among those with 
acute insomnia. However, it is unknown whether one-week internet-delivered 
cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in treating acute 
insomnia. This was a randomized controlled trial and 192 participants were 
randomly assigned to the CBT-I group (n = 95) or control group (n = 97). The 
primary outcome was the incidence of chronic insomnia, determined via a 
structured diagnostic questionnaire for insomnia disorders according to the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Secondary 
outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes 
about Sleep (DBAS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale 
(PSAS), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Sleep Hygiene and 
Practices Scale (SHPS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 
Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2). At week 12, the incidence 
of chronic insomnia was significantly lower in the CBT-I group compared with 
control group (33.3% [27/81] vs. 65.8% [52/79]). Participants in the CBT-I group 
achieved significantly more improvements in ISI, ESS, PSAS, FIRST, SHPS, 
HADS-Depression, and the mental component summary and physical component summary 
of SF-12v2 than control group, but not DBAS and HADS-Anxiety. This one-week 
internet-delivered CBT-I program is an effective tool to prevent the chronicity 
of acute insomnia.

BACKGROUND: Effective management of physical and psychological symptoms is a 
critical component of comprehensive care for both chronic disease patients and 
apparently healthy individuals experiencing episodic symptoms. Conversational 
agents, which are dialog systems capable of understanding and generating human 
language, have emerged as a potential tool to enhance symptom management through 
interactive support.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics and effectiveness of conversational 
agent-delivered interventions reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 
the management of both physical and psychological symptoms.
DESIGN: A systematic review.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in Pubmed, ACM Digital Library, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, PyscInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and gray literature sources 
from their inception to Oct 2024. Search terms included "conversational agent", 
"symptom", "randomized controlled trial" and their synonyms and hyponyms. 
Duplicates were identified by EndNote, and titles, abstracts and full texts were 
independently screened according to predefined criteria. Data extraction focused 
on basic study characteristics and conversational agent details, with The 
Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool employed for bias assessment.
RESULTS: The search yielded 2756 articles and 29 were finally included for 
review. The included studies predominantly came from developed countries 
(n = 23) and were conducted between 2020 and 2024 (n = 24). The studies 
frequently evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of conversational agent 
interventions (n = 14), with a predominantly focus on psychological symptoms 
(depression, anxiety, etc.) (n = 17). A few studies focused on physical symptoms 
(pain, etc.) (n = 4), while others addressed both symptoms (n = 8). Twenty-five 
distinct conversational agents (Woebot, Tess, etc.) were evaluated, utilizing 
platforms ranging from proprietary applications to common messaging channels 
like WeChat and Facebook Messenger. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was a 
commonly integrated approach (n = 22), with rule-based dialogs (n = 22) as the 
most commonly dialog system methods and Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
(n = 15) as the predominant AI techniques. The median recruitment and completion 
rates were 72 % and 79 %, respectively. The majority of studies reported 
positive user experiences and significant symptom management improvements 
(n = 22). However, risk of bias was high in seventeen studies and presented some 
concerns in nine others.
CONCLUSIONS: Conversational agents have shown promise in enhancing both physical 
and psychological symptom management through positive user experiences and 
effectiveness. However, the high risk of bias identified in many studies 
warrants caution in interpreting these findings. Future research should 
prioritize the methodological quality of RCTs to strengthen the evidence base 
supporting the use of conversational agents as a complementary tool in symptom 
management.

BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in using personalized mental health care 
to treat disorders like depression and anxiety to improve treatment engagement 
and efficacy. This randomized controlled trial will compare a traditional 
symptom severity decision-making algorithm to a novel multivariate 
decision-making algorithm for triage to and adaptation of mental health care. 
The stratified levels of care include a self-guided online wellness program, 
coach-guided online cognitive behavioral therapy, and clinician-delivered 
psychotherapy with or without pharmacotherapy. The novel multivariate algorithm 
will be comprised of baseline (for triage and adaptation) and time-varying 
variables (for adaptation) in four areas: social determinants of mental health, 
early adversity and life stressors, predisposing, enabling, and need influences 
on health service use, and comprehensive mental health status. The overarching 
goal is to evaluate whether the multivariate algorithm improves adherence to 
treatment, symptoms, and functioning above and beyond the symptom-based 
algorithm.
METHODS/DESIGN: This trial will recruit a total of 1000 participants over the 
course of 5 years in the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Participants 
will be recruited from a highly diverse sample of community college students. 
For the symptom severity approach, initial triaging to level of care will be 
based on symptom severity, whereas for the multivariate approach, the triaging 
will be based on a comprehensive set of baseline measures. After the initial 
triaging, level of care will be adapted throughout the duration of the 
treatment, utilizing either symptom severity or multivariate statistical 
approaches. Participants will complete computerized assessments and self-report 
questionnaires at baseline and up to 40 weeks. The multivariate decision-making 
algorithm will be updated annually to improve predictive outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Results will provide a comparison on the traditional symptom 
severity decision-making and the novel multivariate decision-making with respect 
to treatment adherence, symptom improvement, and functional recovery. Moreover, 
the developed multivariate decision-making algorithms may be used as a template 
in other community college settings. Ultimately, findings will inform the 
practice of level of care triage and adaptation in psychological treatments, as 
well as the use of personalized mental health care broadly.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most frequent and burdensome symptom of patients with 
diffuse glioma. It is closely linked to decreased health-related quality of life 
and symptoms such as depression and sleep disturbances. Currently, there is no 
evidence-based treatment that targets severe fatigue in patients with brain 
tumours. Cognitive behavioural therapy is aimed at fatigue-maintaining beliefs 
and behaviour. This therapy has been proven effective in reducing severe fatigue 
in cancer survivors and patients with multiple sclerosis. A blended therapy 
program combines sessions with a therapist with therapist-guided web-based 
therapy modules. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the 
efficacy of blended cognitive behavioural therapy in treating severe fatigue in 
patients with diffuse glioma.
METHODS: We will include a maximum of 100 patients with diffuse glioma with 
clinically and radiologically stable disease and severe fatigue (i.e. Checklist 
Individual Strength, subscale fatigue severity ≥ 35). Patients will be 
randomized to blended cognitive behavioural therapy or a waiting list condition. 
The 12-week intervention GRIP on fatigue consists of five patient-therapist 
sessions and five to eight individualized web-based therapy modules supported by 
email contact. The primary outcome measure is fatigue severity. Secondary 
outcome measures include sleep quality, health-related quality of life, 
depression, anxiety, functional impairment and subjective and objective 
cognitive functioning. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed 
at baseline and after 14 and 24 weeks. Magnetoencephalography and MRI will be 
used to evaluate potential biomarkers for intervention success. This trial has a 
Bayesian design: we will conduct multiple interim analyses to test for efficacy 
or futility of the trial. This is the first trial within the GRIP trial 
platform: a platform developing four to five different interventions for the 
most common symptoms in patients with diffuse glioma.
DISCUSSION: The results of the GRIP on fatigue trial will provide information 
about the efficacy of this intervention on fatigue in patients with diffuse 
glioma. Multiple other outcomes and possible predictors of treatment success 
will also be explored.

BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates for lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder 
are much higher in people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than in 
those without. CANreduce 2.0 is an intervention that is generally effective at 
reducing cannabis use in cannabis misusers. This self-guided web-based 
intervention (6-week duration) consists of modules grounded in motivational 
interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether the CANreduce 2.0 intervention affects 
cannabis use patterns and symptom severity in adults who screen positive for 
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder more than in those who do not.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a previous study with 
the inclusion criterion of cannabis use at least once weekly over the last 30 
days. Adults with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (based on 
the Adult Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder Self-Report screener) who 
were enrolled to the active intervention arms of CANreduce 2.0 were compared 
regarding the number of days cannabis was used in the preceding 30 days, the 
cannabis use disorder identification test score (CUDIT) and the severity of 
dependence scale score (SDS) at baseline and the 3-month follow-up. Secondary 
outcomes were Generalized Anxiety Disorder score, Center for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression scale score, retention, intervention adherence, and safety.
RESULTS: Both adults with (n=94) and without (n=273) positive 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening reported significantly 
reduced frequency (reduction in consumption days: with: mean 11.53, SD 9.28, 
P<.001; without: mean 8.53, SD 9.4, P<.001) and severity of cannabis use (SDS: 
with: mean 3.57, SD 3.65, P<.001; without: mean 2.47, SD 3.39, P<.001; CUDIT: 
with: mean 6.38, SD 5.96, P<.001; without: mean 5.33, SD 6.05, P<.001), as well 
as anxiety (with: mean 4.31, SD 4.71, P<.001; without: mean 1.84, SD 4.22, 
P<.001) and depression (with: mean 10.25, SD 10.54; without: mean 4.39, SD 
10.22, P<.001). Those who screened positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder also reported significantly decreased attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder scores (mean 4.65, SD 4.44, P<.001). There were no significant 
differences in change in use (P=.08), dependence (P=.95), use disorder (P=.85), 
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder status (P=.84), depression (P=.84), or 
anxiety (P=.26) between baseline and final follow-up, dependent on positive 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening. Attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity at baseline was not associated 
with reduced cannabis use frequency or severity but was linked to greater 
reductions in depression (Spearman ρ=.33) and anxiety (Spearman ρ=.28). 
Individuals with positive attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening 
were significantly less likely to fill out the consumption diary (P=.02), but 
the association between continuous attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
symptom severity and retention (Spearman ρ=-0.10, P=.13) was nonsignificant. 
There also was no significant intergroup difference in the number of completed 
modules (with: mean 2.10, SD 2.33; without: mean 2.36, SD 2.36, P=.34), and 
there was no association with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom 
severity (Spearman ρ=-0.09; P=.43). The same was true for the rate of adverse 
effects (P=.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis users screening positive for attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder may benefit from CANreduce 2.0 to decrease the 
frequency and severity of cannabis dependence and attenuate symptoms of 
depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-related symptoms. This 
web-based program's advantages include its accessibility for remote users and a 
personalized counselling option that may contribute to increased adherence and 
motivation to change among program users.

BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common mental disorder in 
adolescents and young adults. Early intervention and support could help prevent 
the development of full-blown SAD. Considering that adolescents with social 
anxiety symptoms do not prefer face-to-face sessions due to their fear of 
communicating with therapists, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
(ICBT) was implemented.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of complete self-help 
ICBT for subthreshold SAD in high school and college students with no history of 
mental disorders.
METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to demonstrate the 
objective was conducted from December 2022 to October 2023. Participants were 
students enrolled at 6 universities and 1 high school. The intervention was a 
complete self-help ICBT and consisted of 10 text-based sessions that taught 
cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for social anxiety in youths and young 
adults. The comparison was a no-treatment condition (control group), which was 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by a computer program. A total of 2 
psychological scales were used to assess the severity of social anxiety, and 1 
psychological scale each was used to measure symptoms of depression, general 
anxiety, and quality of life.
RESULTS: In total, 77 students were enrolled as study participants. Through the 
randomization procedure, 38 participants were included in the intervention 
group, and 39 patients were included in the control group. Results from the 
analysis of covariance with depression as covariates showed that the 
participants in the intervention group had significantly reduced symptoms of 
social anxiety, depression, and general anxiety compared to the control group. 
The response rate was 61% (19/31) in the intervention group and 24% (9/38) in 
the control group: odds ratio (OR) 4.97 (95% CI 1.61-16.53; P=.003) in the 
Fisher exact test. The recovery rate was 68% (21/31) in the intervention group 
and 34% (13/38) in the control group: OR 3.95 (95% CI 1.32-12.56; P=.008). The 
OR for the remission ratio was 2.01 (95% CI 0.64-6.60; P=.20) and for the risk 
of worsening was 0.23 (95% CI 0.002-1.33; P=.10), but no significant difference 
was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this randomized controlled trial show that fully 
unguided ICBT improves subthreshold SAD in adolescents and young adults. 
Interpretation of the effectiveness in preventing SAD that meets the diagnostic 
criteria is limited by sample size and the follow-up period. Future studies 
should include more extended observations and larger sample sizes in high-risk 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is among the most significant health challenges facing 
today's adolescents. Weight gain during adolescence is related to cardiovascular 
disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers in later life. Presently, adolescents 
living in Australia have limited access to age-appropriate obesity prevention 
services.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether a two-way text message 
program, with optional telephone health counseling, improves body mass index 
(BMI) z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents who are overweight.
METHODS: This study will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial (N=150) 
comparing a two-way text message intervention, with optional telephone health 
counseling, to usual care in adolescents (13-18 years old, inclusive) who are 
overweight (recruited from a pediatric weight management clinic and the broader 
community in Sydney, Australia). The intervention group will receive a six-month 
text message program, which consists of two-way, semipersonalized, 
lifestyle-focused text messages (four messages/week) in addition to usual care. 
The control group will be assigned to receive usual care. The study also 
includes a follow-up at 12-months. The primary outcome is a change in BMI z 
score at six months. Secondary outcomes are changes in waist-to-height ratio, 
diet, physical and sedentary activity levels, sleep quality, quality of life, 
self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support, and eating disorder and depression 
symptoms. Also, we will examine acceptability, utility, and engagement with the 
program through a study-specific process evaluation questionnaire, 
semi-structured telephone interviews, and an analysis of health counselor 
communication logs. The analyses will be performed by the intention-to-treat 
principle to assess differences between intervention and control groups.
RESULTS: The study opened for recruitment in December 2019. Data collection is 
expected to be completed by December 2021, and the results for the primary 
outcome are expected to be published in early 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will test the effectiveness of an interactive two-way 
text message program compared to usual care in improving BMI z score and 
lifestyle outcomes in adolescents with overweight. This interactive, innovative, 
and scalable project also aims to inform future practice and community 
initiatives to promote obesity prevention behaviors for adolescents.

PURPOSE: One-third to one-half of ambulatory care patients report insomnia. The 
objective of this clinical review is to detail the many causes and 
evidence-based treatment options for insomnia in outpatients and to recommend 
screening and summarize evidence for the place in therapy of prescription and 
nonprescription treatments.
SUMMARY: This work provides an overview of the literature on insomnia regarding 
causes, patient assessment, and nonpharmacological and pharmacological 
treatments. Patients who present with insomnia should be assessed for sleep 
apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, and all contributing medications as 
well as medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorder diagnoses. The type of 
insomnia, namely difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and 
early morning awakening with resulting functional impairment, should be 
documented in addition to whether insomnia is short term or persistent. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) or digital CBT-I is first-line 
treatment for all patients with insomnia irrespective of the cause or type. 
Nonprescription treatments such as antihistamines or melatonin are for select 
populations. Prescription hypnotics are best utilized on an as-needed basis or 
for nightly use for less than 6 weeks. Z-hypnotics are safe and effective for 
insomnia in persons with depression or an anxiety disorder but should be avoided 
in older individuals or if there is respiratory or cognitive impairment. Orexin 
receptor antagonists are effective for sleep initiation and maintenance in 
healthy persons or if there is mild cognitive impairment, but they require 
further study in individuals with psychiatric and medical diagnoses. Trazodone 
is the most prescribed off-label treatment due to its efficacy for sleep 
initiation and maintenance and its lack of abuse potential.
CONCLUSION: Insomnia treatment should be guided by patient age, diagnoses, and 
type of insomnia. Pharmacological treatments should be used at the lowest 
effective dose for the shortest duration of time.

BACKGROUND: This study consisted of a qualitative exploration of stakeholder 
experience regarding the implementation of internet-delivered cognitive 
behavioral therapy (iCBT) as part of routine service provision within the UK's 
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies program.
METHODS: Stakeholder groups included service providers (n = 6), commercial iCBT 
representatives (n = 6) and patients who received a course of iCBT as part of 
treatment at the service (n = 7). Participants took part in a semi-structured 
interview over the telephone, and subsequent data were qualitatively analyzed 
using the descriptive-interpretive approach.
RESULTS: Service providers highlighted the importance of effective leadership 
and management, training initiatives, the provision of feedback to commercial 
iCBT representatives and creating work structures around iCBT to facilitate iCBT 
supporting staff in their use of it. Commercial iCBT representatives similarly 
reported the importance of training clinicians in iCBT use, identifying the 
appropriate individuals at all levels of the service to drive iCBT 
implementation, and the importance of being responsive to any problems or needs 
that arise from the service. Patients reported an overall positive experience of 
receiving iCBT but highlighted a need for more information from their supporter 
and the intervention to better structure their usage. Contextual factors, in 
terms of barriers and facilitators, were also highlighted by service provider 
and commercial participants; citing negative clinician attitudes and 
technological issues/bugs as barriers to implementation, and the exposure to 
iCBT created by COVID-19 and perseverance in using iCBT over time as 
facilitators.
DISCUSSION: The findings contribute to a growing field of literature that seeks 
to understand the experience of relevant stakeholders who are involved with and 
contribute to iCBT implementation, including commercial iCBT representatives 
who, to our knowledge, have not been accounted for as part of published research 
to date.

BACKGROUND: Despite parents of children treated for cancer commonly reporting 
psychological difficulties such as symptoms of depression and anxiety, there is 
a lack of evidence-based psychological interventions tailored to their needs. We 
therefore developed an internet-administered, guided, low-intensity cognitive 
behavioural therapy-based self-help intervention (EJDeR). We examined the 
acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and study procedures in the 
single-arm feasibility trial ENGAGE. Results suggested the intervention and 
study procedures are feasible and acceptable. However, a need for modifications 
and refinements to the intervention and study procedures was identified. We 
conducted a qualitative interview study to explore the acceptability and 
feasibility of the intervention and study procedures from the perspective of 
parents to inform modifications and refinements to the intervention and study 
procedures.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 parents (17 fathers, 
35 mothers). A public contribution group (three parents of children treated for 
cancer) analysed the data independently from the research team and contributed 
to dissemination. An inductive content analysis was performed using the 
Framework Method.
RESULTS: The intervention was perceived as acceptable and relevant, and parents 
expressed positive attitudes toward internet-administered support. However, 
parents identified a need for adaptations to intervention content, e.g., a 
greater focus on the family, trauma, and the cancer experience. Barriers to 
engagement were also identified, including technical difficulties and a need for 
modifications to improve intervention user-friendliness and smartphone and/or 
tablet compatibility. Study procedures were also perceived as acceptable and 
feasible. However, a need was identified to improve parents' understanding of 
the study and to reduce the amount and frequency of assessments. The public 
contributors' analysis was similar to that of the research team. However, the 
research team overlooked important nuances. For example, the public 
contributors' analysis highlighted parents' difficulties distinguishing between 
the intervention and study procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention and study procedures were perceived as acceptable 
and feasible. However, the need for important modifications and refinements were 
suggested to improve future acceptability and feasibility. Involving public 
contributors in the analysis resulted in developing a more comprehensive and 
nuanced understanding of the data.

The crisis in Syria has resulted in vast numbers of refugees seeking asylum in 
Syria's neighbouring countries as well as in Europe. Refugees are at 
considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including depression, 
anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most refugees do not have 
access to mental health services for these problems because of multiple barriers 
in national and refugee specific health systems, including limited availability 
of mental health professionals. To counter some of challenges arising from 
limited mental health system capacity the World Health Organization (WHO) has 
developed a range of scalable psychological interventions aimed at reducing 
psychological distress and improving functioning in people living in communities 
affected by adversity. These interventions, including Problem Management Plus 
(PM+) and its variants, are intended to be delivered through individual or group 
face-to-face or smartphone formats by lay, non-professional people who have not 
received specialized mental health training, We provide an evidence-based 
rationale for the use of the scalable PM+ oriented programmes being adapted for 
Syrian refugees and provide information on the newly launched STRENGTHS 
programme for adapting, testing and scaling up of PM+ in various modalities in 
both neighbouring and European countries hosting Syrian refugees.

buscan asilo en países vecinos a Siria, así como en Europa. Los refugiados 
corren un riesgo considerable de desarrollar trastornos mentales comunes, como 
depresión, ansiedad y trastorno por estrés postraumático (TEPT). La mayoría de 
los refugiados no tienen acceso a servicios de salud mental para estos problemas 
debido a las múltiples barreras existentes en los sistemas de salud nacionales y 
específicos para refugiados, incluida una limitada disponibilidad de 
profesionales de salud mental. Para contrarrestar algunos de los retos derivados 
de la limitada capacidad del sistema de salud mental, la Organización Mundial de 
la Salud (OMS) ha desarrollado una gama de intervenciones psicológicas 
escalables dirigidas a reducir la angustia psicológica y mejorar el 
funcionamiento de las personas afectadas por la adversidad. Estas 
intervenciones, que incluyen Problem Management Plus (Gestión de problemas plus, 
PM+) y sus variantes, están pensadas para ser aplicadas en formatos cara a cara 
o mediante teléfonos inteligentes a individuos o grupos por personas no 
profesionales que no han recibido formación especializada en salud 
mental,Proporcionamos una justificación basada en la evidencia para el uso de 
programas escalables orientados a la PM+ que están siendo adaptados para 
refugiados sirios y proporcionamos información sobre el programa STRENGTHS 
recientemente lanzado para adaptar, probar y ampliar la PM+ en diversas 
modalidades, tanto en los países vecinos como en los europeos que reciben

叙利亚危机导致了海量的难民到周边国家和欧洲寻求避难所。难民们发展出常见心理障碍的风险非常大，其中包括抑郁，焦虑，创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）。大多数难民没有渠道向心理健康机构寻求帮助，这主要是因为国家医疗和难民健康系统的种种阻碍，包括心理健康专家的数量不足。为了应对心理健康系统容量有限所产生的问题，世界卫生组织（WHO）发展出了一系列的可量化心理干预方法，用来减少心理障碍和提高社区中处于逆境里的人们的生活功能。这些干预方法中就有《问题应对量表Plus》（PM+）和它的其他变型，用来给未经过专业心理健康训练的非专业新手以面对面的或智能手机的形式向个人或群体使用。我们为针对叙利亚难民改良的可量化的PM+为基础的项目提供了有证据支持的原理，并且提供了关于新近运行的STRENGTHS项目的信息，该项目旨在在接受叙利亚难民的周边国家和欧洲国家中适应、测试、扩大PM+的多种形式。.

BACKGROUND: Long-term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and 
adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing 
psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to 
face-to-face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available 
interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology 
improves, e-health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers 
and smart phones and ranging from simple text-based programmes through to 
multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and 
biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological 
needs of this group of young people.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of e-health interventions in comparison 
with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, 
waiting-list controls, or non-psychological treatments for treating anxiety and 
depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's 
Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 - 18 August 
2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross-search 
2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand-searched relevant conference proceedings, 
reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We 
also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing 
trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
cluster-randomised trials, and cross-over trials of e-health interventions for 
treating any type of long-term physical condition in children and adolescents 
(aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of 
anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long-term physical 
conditions as those that were more than three-months' duration. We assessed 
symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient- or clinician-administered 
validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 (American Psychological 
Association 2013), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria (World Health Organization 1992). 
Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical 
interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological 
placebo, and other non-psychological therapies were eligible comparators.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed titles, 
abstracts, and full-text articles; discrepancies were resolved through 
discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio 
(OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to 
analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook 
meta-analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical 
question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis.
MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier 
Online, Web-MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which 
included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at 
least one meta-analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long-term 
physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and 
others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), 
chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms 
of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings 
and hospital clinics in high income countries.For the primary outcome of change 
in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low-quality evidence 
meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were 
clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 
441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus 
any comparator, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be 
determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any 
comparator (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For 
the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low-quality 
evidence that e-health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator 
(SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants).For the secondary 
outcome of quality of life, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it 
could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than 
any comparator (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For 
the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low-quality evidence 
meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were 
clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 
368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long-term physical 
condition, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be 
determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any 
comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants).The 
risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of 
bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was 
considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published 
protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by 
the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse 
effects were reported by any authors.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, the field of e-health interventions for the 
treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long-term 
physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low-quality 
of the evidence means the effects of e-health interventions are uncertain at 
this time, especially in children aged under 10 years.Although it is too early 
to recommend e-health interventions for this clinical population, given their 
growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there 
appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and 
effective technologically-based treatments to suit children and adolescents with 
long-term physical conditions.

BACKGROUND: Canadian public safety personnel (PSP) report high rates of mental 
health concerns and barriers to treatment. PSPNET is a clinical research unit 
that offers internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) that is free, 
confidential, and developed with and for PSP. Treatment outcomes are promising 
with clinically significant symptom improvement (eg, anxiety, depression, and 
posttraumatic stress) and favorable treatment satisfaction. While these results 
are promising, research has yet to explore ways to optimize therapist-guided 
ICBT for leaders within public safety. Optimizing ICBT for leaders is 
particularly important given their widespread organizational impact.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate (1) the perceived mental health 
stressors of Canadian leaders within public safety, (2) the degree to which 
leaders perceived existing therapist-guided ICBT courses tailored for PSP (ie, 
PSP Wellbeing Course and PSP PTSD Course) as suitable for their needs, and (3) 
ways to further optimize therapist-guided ICBT for public safety leaders.
METHODS: This study included 10 clients who self-identified as being in a 
supervisory or leadership position within their public safety organization and 
completed either the therapist-guided PSP Wellbeing Course or PSP PTSD Course. 
We used descriptive statistics to analyze demographics, mental health symptoms, 
treatment engagement, and treatment satisfaction. We also used a reflexive 
thematic analysis of semistructured interview transcripts to assess leaders' 
course perceptions and feedback.
RESULTS: Canadian leaders within public safety reported occupational and 
nonoccupational stressors and enrolled in ICBT to support their own or 
colleagues' mental health. Most clients enrolled in the PSP Wellbeing Course, 
accessed 4 of 5 lessons (n=7, 70%), engaged with therapist support (n=7, 70%), 
and identified as employed (n=8, 80%), White (n=8, 80%), and men (n=7, 70%) with 
an average age of 45 years. At pretreatment, 80% of clients endorsed clinically 
significant symptoms of one or more disorders; most often depression (n=7, 70%) 
and anger (n=6, 60%). Clients reported favorable attitudes toward the ICBT 
courses with most reporting that they were satisfied with the course (n=9, 90%). 
Feedback to further optimize ICBT content for leaders included the development 
of a leader case story (n=6, 60%) and new resources to help leaders apply skills 
learned in ICBT within the context of their leadership roles (n=4, 40%). Leaders 
also recommended optimizing ICBT delivery by improving the platform technology 
and incorporating more multimedia.
CONCLUSIONS: Canadian leaders within public safety perceived therapist-guided 
ICBT developed with and for PSP as a suitable treatment option for their needs 
and identified ways to further optimize its content and delivery. Future 
research should investigate the impacts of these efforts and explore optimizing 
ICBT for other groups of clients.

BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent anxiety 
disorders in Canada. Viable therapy options for the treatment of SAD include CBT 
being delivered virtually. In Australia, an innovative internet-delivered 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for social anxiety has been 
developed, implemented, and demonstrated as effective. To make available 
high-quality and real-time evidence in response to the crucial need to access 
psychological services to meet population mental health needs, we propose to 
conduct a Canadian adaptation of the iCBT Shyness Program and to examine the 
program's effectiveness, and implementation in two Canadian provinces (Quebec 
and Ontario).
METHODS: The overall study design is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study 
of a quasi-experimental parallel group trial. Prior to implementing the iCBT 
Shyness Program, it will undergo an initial adaptation to the Canadian context 
and focus groups will be conducted with key actor groups to discuss the 
adaptations to the graphics, narration of the lessons, and this to better 
reflect varying socio-cultural context among Canadian French- and 
English-speaking populations. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the program 
in three parallel pathways reflecting real-world pathways: (1) self-refer to the 
intervention; (2) recommended by a health professional without guidance; and (3) 
recommended by a health professional, with low-intensity guidance. Data 
collection will be carried out at baseline, at the beginning of each lesson, 
12-week and 6-month follow-up. Outcomes measured will include anxiety and 
depressive symptoms, psychological distress, disability, as well as health 
service utilization and satisfaction. Semi-structured interviews will then be 
conducted with study participants and health care providers to explore 
facilitating factors and barriers to the implementation of the iCBT adapted 
program.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness, barriers and 
facilitating factors to implementing a low-intensity iCBT in the Canadian 
context for SAD, which will bridge an important care gap for undeserved 
populations in Canada with SAD. Findings will inform the eventual scaling up of 
the program in community-based primary care across Canada. This would improve 
equity of the health care system by helping a large number of Canadians to 
timely access to mental health services.

BACKGROUND: Public safety personnel (PSP) are exposed to traumatic events due to 
their work environments, which increases the risk of mental health challenges. 
Providing effective and evidence-based interventions, such as SMS text messaging 
programs, can improve PSP's overall mental well-being with high user 
satisfaction rates.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate users' satisfaction, receptiveness, and 
perceptions of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based supportive SMS text 
messaging intervention (Text4PTSI).
METHODS: Participants self-subscribed to Text4PTSI and received unidirectional 
cognitive behavioral-based supportive text messages for 6 months. Participants 
completed a web-based survey delivered via SMS text message at enrollment, and 6 
weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post enrollment. Respondents' perception and 
receptivity of the program were assessed using a questionnaire measured on a 
5-point Likert scale. Data were collected as categorical variables, and overall 
satisfaction with the Text4PTSI program was measured on a scale from 0 to 100.
RESULTS: There were 131 subscribers to the Text4PTSI program; however, only 81 
subscribers responded to the survey, producing 100 survey responses across the 3 
follow-up time points. The overall mean score of satisfaction was 85.12 (SD 
13.35). More than half of the survey responses agreed or strongly agreed that 
Text4PTSI helped participants cope with anxiety (79/100 responses, 79%), 
depressive symptoms (72/100 responses, 72%), and loneliness (54/100 responses, 
54%). Similarly, most of the survey responses agreed or strongly agreed that the 
Text4PTSI program made respondents feel connected to a support system, improved 
their overall mental well-being (84/100 responses, 84%), felt more hopeful about 
managing concerns about their mental health or substance use (82 out of 
responses, 82%), and helped enhance their overall quality of life (77/100 
responses, 77%). The available survey responses suggest that the majority always 
read the supportive text messages (84/100 responses, 84%), took time to reflect 
on each message (75/100 responses, 75%), and returned to read the text messages 
more than once (76/100 responses, 76%).
CONCLUSIONS: PSP who responded to the follow-up surveys reported high user 
satisfaction and appreciation for receiving the Text4PTSI intervention during 
the 6-month program. The reported satisfaction with the service provided could 
pave the way to ensuring a better uptake of the service with potential 
effectiveness to end users.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the overall effectiveness of non-pharmacological 
interventions on internet addiction (IA) in youth.
METHOD: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from their inception to 
April 1, 2023 were searched in Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, China 
National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal 
Database, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, and WanFang Data. Two 
reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated bias using the Cochrane 
Risk of Bias tool.
RESULTS: Sixty-six studies performed from 2007 to 2023, with a total of 4,385 
participants, were identified. The NPIs included group counseling, cognitive 
behavioral therapy, sports intervention, combined interventions, eHealth, 
educational intervention, positive psychology intervention, sand play 
intervention, and electrotherapy. The results revealed that NPIs significantly 
reduced IA levels (standardized mean difference, SMD: -2.01, 95% confidence 
interval, CI: -2.29 to -1.73, I2 = 93.0%), anxiety levels (SMD: -1.07, 95%CI: 
-1.41 to -0.73, I2 = 72.4%), depression levels (SMD: -1.11, 95%CI: -1.52 to 
-0.7, I2 = 84.3%), and SCL-90 (SMD: -0.75, 95%CI: -0.97 to -0.54, I2 = 27.7%). 
Subgroup analysis stratified by intervention measure showed that cognitive 
behavioral therapy, group counseling, sports intervention, combined 
intervention, educational intervention, positive psychology intervention, 
sandplay intervention, and mobile health were all effective in relieving 
symptoms of IA except electrotherapy.
CONCLUSION: NPIs appear to be effective in the treatment of IA in youth, which 
would act as an alternative treatment of IA. Further studies with larger sample 
sizes and robust designs are needed.

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of online 
mental health interventions for youth.
METHODS: We searched seven electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, 
Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS) for the past 10 years to identify 
randomized controlled trials which have evaluated the use of telehealth 
interventions for young people with mental health problems. The included studies 
were assessed for quality and risk of bias.
RESULTS: Forty-five randomized controlled trials (n = 13,291 participants) were 
eligible for this review. Most studies (35 trials) evaluated the use of 
web-based self-help platforms to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (14 
trials), mindfulness (four trials), acceptance commitment therapy (five trials) 
and positive psychology (two trials). Mobile/computer applications were used to 
deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (four trials) and coping strategies 
training (two trials). Web-based synchronous chat (one trial) was used to assist 
communication between counsellors and participants. Three studies used 
artificial intelligence-based conversational agents to deliver cognitive 
behavioural therapy (two trials) and problem-solving-strategy training (one 
trial). Eighty-two percent (n = 37) identified the participants as student 
population (i.e. university students, high school students). Sixty-four percent 
(n = 29) of the telehealth interventions were found to be effective in managing 
depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia and improving quality of life when 
compared with control conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Online mental health interventions were found to be effective in 
managing diverse mental health conditions among youth. Online self-help 
platforms were the most frequently used modality and artificial 
intelligence-based chatbots are merging as potential solutions. Future research 
is warranted to investigate the solutions to improve the retention rate and 
satisfaction of telehealth interventions among this population.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is a well-established 
first-line treatment for insomnia and sleep difficulties, yet numerous barriers 
hinder its widespread adoption. One potential criticism of the existing evidence 
base for CBTi is that many trials exclude participants that would commonly be 
seen in in primary care, such as those aged over 65, with comorbid health 
conditions, or prescribed sleep medication. The current pilot study therefore 
aimed to assess the acceptability and efficacy of a brief, digitally delivered 
sleep intervention, the Sleep Course, using a broad range of participants. 
Participants (n = 74) completed the 6-week, 4-lesson intervention alongside 
measures of sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, depression, anxiety and 
sleep-wake patterns (via sleep diary). Generalized estimating equations analysis 
modelled change in participants' outcomes from pre- to post-treatment and 
3-month follow-up, and subgroup analyses explored the role of possible 
moderators (e.g., age over 65, co-morbidities, and concurrent prescription 
medication use). The intervention was associated with good rates of satisfaction 
(79 %) and lesson completion (70 %). Results showed significant and large 
reductions in insomnia, sleep disturbance and associated symptoms (e.g., 
d = 1.06-1.37 change in insomnia symptoms). Evidence of high acceptability and 
clinical improvement was found irrespective of age, physical comorbidity, and 
sleep medication use. However, there was evidence of less improvement among 
those taking medications or having tried psychological treatment in the past. 
These results provide strong preliminary evidence for the intervention as an 
acceptable, efficacious and scalable treatment for a broad range of participants 
with sleep difficulties. Larger randomised controlled trials are needed.

OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) 
improves several sleep and health outcomes in individuals with insomnia. This 
study investigates whether changes in Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about 
Sleep (DBAS) during dCBT-I mediate changes in psychological distress, fatigue, 
and insomnia severity.
PATIENTS/METHODS: The study presents a secondary planned analysis of data from 
1073 participants in a randomized control trial (Total sample = 1721) of dCBT-I 
compared with patient education (PE). Self-ratings with the Dysfunctional 
Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale 
(HADS), the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) 
were obtained at baseline and 9-week follow-up. Hayes PROCESS mediation analyses 
were conducted to test for mediation.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: sDBAS scores were significantly reduced at 9-week 
follow-up for those randomized to dCBT-I (n = 566) compared with PE (n = 507). 
The estimated mean difference was -1.49 (95% CI -1.66 to -1.31, p < .001, 
Cohen's d. = 0.93). DBAS mediated all the effect of dCBT-I on the HADS and the 
CFQ, and 64% of the change on the ISI (Estimated indirect effect -3.14, 95% CI 
-3.60 to -2.68) at 9-week follow-up compared with PE. Changes in the DBAS fully 
mediated the effects of dCBT-I on psychological distress and fatigue, and the 
DBAS partially mediated the effects on insomnia severity. These findings may 
have implications for understanding how dCBT-I works and highlights the role of 
changing cognitions in dCBT-I.

This cross-sectional study addresses two important contributions to 
understanding behavioral intention to use online mental health interventions: 
(a) to investigate the proposed behavioral intention model in predicting the use 
of online mental health interventions, and (b) to compare the proposed 
behavioral intention model in predicting the use of online mental health 
interventions between Chinese and Thai patients and between healthy individuals 
and those with mental health disorders. The samples included 250 Chinese 
respondents and 251 Thai respondents. Data were collected using Likert 
questionnaires with a reliability of 0.75 to 0.95 and analyzed via confirmatory 
factor analysis and multigroup structural equation modeling. The structural 
model of behavioral intention to use online mental health intervention was shown 
the significant acceptances on indices in overall group. However, the result did 
not enhance the previous literature review according to the proposed behavioral 
intention model. Most latent variables in this study did not show an influence 
on behavioral intention to use online mental health services. Individual 
characteristics, particularly mental health literacy, only significantly 
predicted behavioral intention to use online mental health interventions. 
However, significant influences in some observed variables were detected, such 
as informational support and emotional support in social support, including 
media and the general public in social influence. Comparing the multigroup 
model, no difference in the causal relationship model between Chinese and Thai 
patients was found, but a difference between healthy individuals and those with 
mental health disorders, especially individual characteristics to behavioral 
intention path and social support to attitude toward use path, was found. 
Results highlight the benefits of further development and patient education of 
online mental health services in the future.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes fatigue, pain, and fecal 
urgency/incontinence symptoms. Identifying symptom profile subgroups and related 
psychological correlates might enable earlier intervention and more effective 
tailored treatment pathways.
METHODS: This study was nested within a randomized controlled trial of a digital 
symptom intervention for people with IBD (n = 780). Latent profile analysis was 
conducted on pre-randomization baseline measures of fatigue, pain, and fecal 
incontinence. Multinominal logistic regression examined associations between 
profile membership and clinical, demographic and psychological factors.
RESULTS: Latent profile analysis determined a three-profile model: Moderate 
(50%), High (40%), and Severe symptoms (10%). Diagnosis and fecal calprotectin 
were not associated with profile membership, but female gender, comorbidity, 
time since diagnosis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms were 
associated with High and Severe symptoms profiles. Depression, anxiety, negative 
symptom perceptions, all-or-nothing and avoidance behaviors significantly 
increased the relative risk of High and Severe symptoms profile membership.
CONCLUSIONS: Many participants experienced symptoms even when deemed to be in 
clinical remission. After controlling for clinical, inflammatory, and 
demographic factors, the relative risk of High or Severe symptom profile 
membership was associated with potentially modifiable cognitive behavioral 
factors. These factors were also associated with IBS-type symptoms. Recognizing 
the potential impact of cognitive behavioral factors in exacerbating symptoms 
can lead to earlier identification of patients who require support and allows 
treatment plans to be tailored more precisely. The findings from this study 
promote a more integrated approach to IBD management, combining medical 
treatment with cognitive behavioral interventions to enhance patient care and 
improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Although cognitive behavioral therapy for people diagnosed with 
schizophrenia (CBTp) is recommended in clinical guidelines internationally, 
rates of implementation are low. One consequence of this has been the 
development of brief individual psychological interventions, which are shorter 
than the recommended minimum of 16 sessions for CBTp. This article is the first 
to systematically identify the brief interventions that exist for people 
diagnosed with schizophrenia and to determine their effectiveness using 
meta-analysis.
METHODS: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web 
of Science) were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials or 
experimental studies of brief individual psychological interventions delivered 
in community settings. Random effects meta-analysis was used to integrate effect 
sizes, due to the heterogeneity of included studies.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified (n = 1,382) that measured thirty 
clinical outcomes and included six intervention types - brief CBT, memory 
training, digital motivation support, reasoning training, psychoeducation, and 
virtual reality. Collectively, brief psychological interventions were found to 
be effective for psychotic symptoms (SMD -0.285, p < 0.01), paranoia (SMD 
-0.277, p < 0.05), data gathering (SMD 0.38, p < 0.01), depression (SMD -0.906, 
p < 0.05) and wellbeing (SMD 0.405, p < 0.01). For intervention types, brief CBT 
was effective for psychotic symptoms (SMD -0.32, p < .001), and reasoning 
training was effective for data gathering (SMD 0.38, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests that brief psychological 
interventions are effective for several key difficulties associated with 
schizophrenia, providing an opportunity to improve both access to, and choice 
of, treatment for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Unrestricted by time and place, electronic health (eHealth) provides 
solutions for patient empowerment and value-based health care. Women in the 
reproductive age are particularly frequent users of internet, social media, and 
smartphone apps. Therefore, the pregnant patient seems to be a prime candidate 
for eHealth-supported health care with telemedicine for fetal and maternal 
conditions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the current literature on eHealth 
developments in pregnancy to assess this new generation of perinatal care.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of studies on eHealth 
technology in perinatal care in PubMed and EMBASE in June 2017. Studies 
reporting the use of eHealth during prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal care were 
included. Given the heterogeneity in study methods, used technologies, and 
outcome measurements, results were analyzed and presented in a narrative 
overview of the literature.
RESULTS: The literature search provided 71 studies of interest. These studies 
were categorized in 6 domains: information and eHealth use, lifestyle 
(gestational weight gain, exercise, and smoking cessation), gestational 
diabetes, mental health, low- and middle-income countries, and telemonitoring 
and teleconsulting. Most studies in gestational diabetes and mental health show 
that eHealth applications are good alternatives to standard practice. Examples 
are interactive blood glucose management with remote care using smartphones, 
telephone screening for postnatal depression, and Web-based cognitive behavioral 
therapy. Apps and exercise programs show a direction toward less gestational 
weight gain, increase in step count, and increase in smoking abstinence. 
Multiple studies describe novel systems to enable home fetal monitoring with 
cardiotocography and uterine activity. However, only few studies assess outcomes 
in terms of fetal monitoring safety and efficacy in high-risk pregnancy. 
Patients and clinicians report good overall satisfaction with new strategies 
that enable the shift from hospital-centered to patient-centered care.
CONCLUSIONS: This review showed that eHealth interventions have a very broad, 
multilevel field of application focused on perinatal care in all its aspects. 
Most of the reviewed 71 articles were published after 2013, suggesting this 
novel type of care is an important topic of clinical and scientific relevance. 
Despite the promising preliminary results as presented, we accentuate the need 
for evidence for health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and the impact on costs 
of the possibilities of eHealth interventions in perinatal care. In general, the 
combination of increased patient empowerment and home pregnancy care could lead 
to more satisfaction and efficiency. Despite the challenges of privacy, 
liability, and costs, eHealth is very likely to disperse globally in the next 
decade, and it has the potential to deliver a revolution in perinatal care.

BACKGROUND: Young adults have high rates of mental health conditions, but most 
do not want or cannot access treatment. By leveraging a medium that young adults 
routinely use, text messaging programs have potential to keep young adults 
engaged with content supporting self-management of mental health issues and can 
be delivered inexpensively at scale. We designed an intervention that imparts 
strategies for self-managing mental health symptoms through interactive text 
messaging dialogues and engages users through novelty and variety in strategies 
(from cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and 
positive psychology) and styles of interaction (e.g., prompts, peer stories, 
writing tasks).
METHODS: The aim of this mixed-methods study was to pilot 1- and 2-week versions 
of an interactive text messaging intervention among young adults (ages 18-25), 
and to obtain feedback to guide intervention refinements. Young adults were 
recruited via a mental health advocacy website and snowball sampling at a North 
American University. We used Wizard-of-Oz methods in which study staff sent 
messages based on a detailed script. Transcripts of interviews were subject to 
qualitative analysis to identify aspects of the program that need improvements, 
and to gather participant perspectives on possible solutions.
RESULTS: Forty-eight individuals ages 18-25 participated in the study (mean age: 
22.0). 85 % responded to the program at least once. Among those who ever 
responded, they replied to messages on 85 % of days, and with engagement 
sustained over the study period. Participants endorsed the convenience of text 
messaging, the types of interactive dialogues, and the variety of content. They 
also identified needed improvements to message volume, scheduling, and content.
CONCLUSIONS: Young adults showed high levels of engagement and satisfaction with 
a texting program supporting mental health self-management. The program may be 
improved through refining personalization, timing, and message volume, and 
extending content to support use over a longer timeframe. If shown to be 
effective in randomized trials, this program has potential to help address a 
substantial treatment gap in young adults' mental health.

BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is an 
effective and convenient means of offering cognitive behavioral therapy to the 
general population. To increase access to ICBT among Canadian public safety 
personnel (PSP)-a group that experiences elevated rates of mental health 
concerns and barriers to mental health care-a clinical research unit called 
PSPNET has tailored ICBT to PSP, primarily through offering case stories and 
PSP-specific examples within an ICBT program. PSPNET's first and most frequently 
used ICBT program, called the PSP Wellbeing Course, has been found to reduce 
symptoms of mental disorders (eg, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress) 
among PSP. Little research, however, has investigated clients' perceptions of 
the case stories in this course.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to expand the literature on the use and 
evaluation of case stories in ICBT among PSP. Specifically, this study 
investigated (1) PSP's perceptions of the case stories using the theoretical 
model provided by Shaffer and Zikmund-Fisher and (2) PSP feedback on the case 
stories in the PSP Wellbeing Course.
METHODS: This study included 41 clients who completed the PSP Wellbeing Course. 
Of these, 27 clients completed a bespoke questionnaire called the Stories 
Questionnaire, 10 of whom also participated in a semistructured interview.
RESULTS: Findings show that perceptions of the case stories in the PSP Wellbeing 
Course were largely positive and that the case stories were generally successful 
in achieving the 5 purposes of case stories (ie, informing, comforting, 
modeling, engaging, and persuading) proposed by Shaffer and Zikmund-Fisher. 
Client feedback also identified 3 tangible areas for story improvement: 
characters, content, and delivery. Each area highlights the need for and 
potential benefits of story development. Not all PSP engaged with the case 
stories, though, so results must be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study adds to the growing body of research supporting 
the use of case stories in internet-delivered interventions among PSP.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia symptoms are common during the postpartum period, yet 
interventions remain scarce. This trial aimed to simultaneously examine the 
efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and light dark therapy (LDT), 
targeting different mechanisms, against treatment-as-usual (TAU), in reducing 
maternal postpartum insomnia symptoms.
METHODS: This three-arm randomised controlled trial recruited from the general 
community in Australia. Nulliparous females 4-12 months postpartum with 
self-reported insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores >7] were 
included; severe medical/psychiatric conditions were excluded. Participants were 
randomised 1:1:1 to CBT, LDT, or TAU stratified by ISI (< or ⩾14) and infant age 
(< or ⩾8 months). Participants and principal investigators were unblinded. 
Six-week interventions were delivered via digital materials and telephone. The 
primary outcome was insomnia symptoms (ISI), assessed pre-, midpoint-, post- 
(primary endpoint), and one-month post-intervention. Analyses were 
intention-to-treat using latent growth models.
RESULTS: 114 participants (CBT = 39, LDT = 36, TAU = 39; Mage = 32.20 ± 4.62 
years) were randomised. There were significantly greater reductions in ISI 
scores in CBT and LDT (effect sizes -2.01 and -1.52 respectively, p < 0.001) 
from baseline to post-intervention compared to TAU; improvements were maintained 
at follow-up. Similar effects were observed for self-reported sleep disturbance. 
There were greater reductions in fatigue in CBT (effect size = 0.85, p < 0.001) 
but not LDT (p = 0.11) compared to TAU. Changes in sleepiness, depression, and 
anxiety were non-significant compared to TAU (all p > 0.08). Four participants 
(11%) in the LDT group reported headaches, dizziness, or nausea; no others 
reported adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapist-assisted CBT and LDT were feasible during the first 
postpartum year; data at post-intervention and 1-month follow-up support their 
safety and efficacy in reducing postpartum insomnia symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: Persecutory delusions are very common in severe mental health 
disorders such as schizophrenia. Existing treatments often do not work well 
enough. We developed a face-to-face theory-driven psychological intervention, 
called Feeling Safe, that produces very large reductions in persistent 
persecutory delusions. The challenge now is to make Feeling Safe widely 
available. So, we developed a 6-month supported online version, called Feeling 
Safer. The aim is an intervention that patients can easily access and use, 
reduces persecutory delusions and can be supported by a range of mental health 
professionals in less contact time than face-to-face therapy. Initial proof of 
concept testing of Feeling Safer was very encouraging. In a randomised 
controlled trial, we now plan to test whether Feeling Safer is efficacious for 
patients and can be successfully delivered by any of three different mental 
health staff groups (peer-support workers, graduate psychologists and cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) therapists). We will also test whether Feeling Safer 
works equally across gender, age, ethnicity and cognitive functioning 
(moderation) and whether Feeling Safer works via the targeted psychological 
processes (mediation).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a multicentre, single-blind (outcome 
assessor), parallel, four-arm randomised controlled trial; 484 patients with 
persistent persecutory delusions will be randomised to one of the four 
conditions (1:1:1:1): Feeling Safer (added to treatment as usual (TAU)) 
supported by peer-support workers, or Feeling Safer (added to TAU) supported by 
graduate mental health workers including assistant psychologists, or Feeling 
Safer (added to TAU) supported by CBT therapists or TAU. Feeling Safer will be 
provided for 6 months with a staff member. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 
3, 6 and 9 months by research assistants blind to group allocation. The primary 
outcome is severity of persecutory delusions at 6 months rated with the 
Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale-Delusions. The secondary outcomes are other 
psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia, agoraphobia and paranoia), 
psychological well-being, recovery, activity and health-related quality of life. 
Analysis will be conducted under a treatment policy strategy following the 
intention-to-treat principle, incorporating data from all participants including 
those who do not complete treatment. Moderation and mediation will be tested. A 
within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted of Feeling Safer 
compared with TAU.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS 
Health Research Authority (23/LO/0951). Informed consent will be obtained from 
all participants. A key output will be an open-access publication in a 
peer-reviewed journal reporting on the clinical effectiveness of a high-quality 
supported online programme for the treatment of persecutory delusions that has 
the potential to be used at scale in mental health services.

BACKGROUND: Individual face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy is known to be 
effective for bulimia nervosa (BN). Since foods vary considerably between 
regions and cultures in which patients live, cultural adaptation of the 
treatment program is particularly important in cognitive behavioral therapy for 
BN. Recently, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) program was 
developed for Japanese women with BN, adapted to the Japanese food culture. 
However, no previous randomized controlled trial has examined the effectiveness 
of ICBT.
OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a research protocol for strategies to examine the 
effects of guided ICBT.
METHODS: This study is designed as a multicenter, prospective, assessor-blinded 
randomized controlled trial. The treatment groups will be divided into treatment 
as usual (TAU) alone as the control group and ICBT combined with TAU as the 
intervention group. The primary outcome is the total of binge eating and purging 
behaviors assessed before and after treatment by an independent assessor. 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of eating disorder severity, 
depression, anxiety, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and working 
alliances. Treatment satisfaction and working alliances will be measured post 
assessment only. Other measures will be assessed at baseline, post intervention, 
and follow-up, and the outcomes will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.
RESULTS: This study will be conducted at 7 different medical institutions in 
Japan from August 2022 to October 2026. Recruitment of participants began on 
August 19, 2022, and recruitment is scheduled to continue until July 2024. The 
first participants were registered on September 8, 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial in Japan 
comparing the effectiveness of ICBT and TAU in patients with BN.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents a significant global 
health burden requiring urgent attention. This common chronic endocrine and 
cardiometabolic condition affects around 1 in 10 women and individuals assigned 
female at birth, with significant adverse effects on well-being, quality of 
life, and mental health, as well as serious and complex long-term health 
consequences. International guidelines for best health care practice recommend 
the provision of comprehensive cognitive behavioral interventions to support 
self-management and improve health outcomes for those living with PCOS. 
Web-based health interventions have the potential to meet this need in an 
accessible and scalable way.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify barriers to self-management and psychological 
well-being in women with PCOS and adapt a web-based self-management program to 
provide a prototype digital support intervention for them.
METHODS: We adapted an existing support program (HOPE) for PCOS using the 
antecedent target measure approach. We conducted qualitative interviews with 13 
adult women living with PCOS, 3 trustees of a patients with PCOS advocacy 
charity, and 4 endocrinologists to identify "antecedents" (barriers) to 
self-management and psychological well-being. Framework analysis was used to 
identify potentially modifiable antecedents to be targeted by the novel 
intervention. At a national conference, 58 key stakeholders (patients and health 
professionals) voted for the antecedents they felt were most important to 
address. We used research evidence and relevant theory to design a prototype for 
the PCOS intervention.
RESULTS: Voting identified 32 potentially modifiable antecedents, relating to 
knowledge, understanding, emotions, motivation, and behaviors, as priorities to 
be targeted in the new intervention. A modular, web-based prototype HOPE PCOS 
intervention was developed to address these, covering six broad topic areas 
(instilling HOPE for PCOS; managing the stress of PCOS; feeding your mind and 
body well; body image, intimacy, and close relationships; staying healthy with 
PCOS; and keeping PCOS in its place).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers to self-management and psychological 
well-being in women with PCOS and used these to adapt a web-based 
self-management program, tailoring it for PCOS, which is a comprehensive group 
intervention combining education, empowerment, lifestyle management, peer 
support with cognitive behavioral tools, and goal-setting (to be delivered by 
peers or codelivered with health care professionals). The modular structure 
offers flexibility to adapt the program further as new clinical recommendations 
emerge. The intervention has the potential to be delivered, evaluated for 
feasibility, and, if effective, integrated into health care services. 
Self-management interventions are not designed to replace clinical care; rather, 
they serve as an additional source of support. The HOPE PCOS program conveys 
this message in its content and activities. Future research should evaluate the 
prototype intervention using primary outcomes such as measures of psychological 
well-being, self-management self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and PCOS-related 
quality of life. They should also assess the intervention's acceptability, 
scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: Infant regulatory problems are a common source of concern for 
parents, and they increase the risk of impaired infant-caregiver bonding. 
Despite their impact, they are often overlooked in Ethiopia. Hence, this study 
aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of infant regulatory 
problems in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites in 
southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 451 
mother-infant pairs from February 15 to March 15, 2022. Regulatory problems were 
assessed using diagnostic interviews for regulatory problems. The data was 
collected using an open data kit Android application and analyzed with Stata 
version 17.0. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were 
computed to identify factors associated with each infant regulatory problem. 
Statistical significance was declared at a p-value < 0.05.
RESULTS: In this study, four hundred forty-nine mother-infant pairs were 
involved, with a response rate of 99.5%. The prevalence of excessive crying, 
feeding problems, and sleeping difficulties was 14.03% [95% CI: 10.95, 17.59], 
20.04% [95% CI: 16.44, 24.05], and 13.59% [95% CI: 10.55, 17.11], respectively. 
Attending primary education (AOR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.22, 5.32), high perceived 
social support (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.89), feeding problems (AOR: 5.0, 95% 
CI: 2.65, 9.45), and depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) symptoms (AOR: 2.67, 
95% CI: 1.19, 5.98) were associated with excessive crying. In addition, a family 
size of above five (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.22), excessive crying (AOR: 3.76, 
95% CI: 1.85, 7.65), sleeping problems (AOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.13, 4.65), comorbid 
DAS symptoms (AOR: 3.42, 95% CI: 1.64, 7.11), alcohol abuse (AOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 
1.04, 3.42), and late initiation of complementary feeding (AOR: 2.67, 95% CI: 
1.22, 5.88) were associated with feeding problems. Furthermore, attending 
primary education (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.77), feeding problems (AOR: 3.47, 
95% CI: 1.86, 6.48), and comorbid DAS symptoms (AOR: 3.23, 95% CI: 1.53, 6.84) 
were associated with sleeping problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of infants encountered at least one 
regulatory problem. Level of education, perceived social support, feeding 
problems, and DAS symptoms were associated with excessive crying. Large family 
sizes, excessive crying, sleeping problems, comorbid DAS symptoms, alcohol abuse 
and, late initiation of complementary feeding increase the likelihood of feeding 
problems. Moreover, attending primary education, feeding problems, and comorbid 
DAS symptoms increase the odds of sleeping problems. Continuous guidance and 
support on infant soothing techniques, cognitive and behavioral therapy, and 
counselling on appropriate coping strategies for postpartum women are imperative 
to reduce the burden of infant regulatory problems.

This randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of an online 
self-management program, "Take Charge of Burn Pain (TCBP)," for 96 individuals 
living with chronic burn pain. Participants were randomly assigned to either the 
7-week TCBP program integrating cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, pain 
education, and self-management strategies or an attention control group focused 
on general burn recovery information. Assessments conducted at baseline, 
post-treatment, and 2- and 5-month follow-ups included measures of pain 
severity, pain interference, pain self-efficacy, posttraumatic stress disorder 
symptoms, and depression. Compared to the control group, participants in the 
TCBP program demonstrated greater reductions in pain severity (mean difference: 
-1.24, 95 % CI: -1.93 to -0.55, p = 0.0007) and pain catastrophizing (mean 
difference: -5.41, 95 % CI: -10.33 to -0.49, p = 0.0318) post-treatment when 
adjusting for key variables. At the two-month follow-up, the TCBP group showed 
significant improvements in pain interference (P = 0.0123), self-efficacy 
(P = 0.0269), functional abilities (P = 0.0014), and social role participation 
(P = 0.0498) compared to the control group. Treatment effects were not sustained 
at 5-month follow-up. Participants in both groups reported high levels of 
satisfaction with the online intervention, with the majority finding the program 
helpful and easy to use, and being willing to recommend it to others with pain. 
Findings suggest preliminary support for short-term benefits of TCBP for 
managing certain facets of chronic burn pain. This underscores the need to 
refine digital approaches to maintain and promote long-term improvements. The 
potential of self-guided online psychological interventions to enhance pain 
coping strategies for burn survivors persists.

Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect 
quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain 
sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, 
reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low 
mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all 
relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American 
Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep 
Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th 
revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the 
adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important 
and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. 
Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self-report. Objective measures 
like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic 
canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia 
range from cognitive-behavioural models to (epi-) genetics and 
psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about 
basic sleep-wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep 
instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive-behavioural models of 
insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive-behavioural therapy for 
insomnia, which is now considered as first-line treatment for insomnia 
worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of 
experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to 
dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to 
therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread 
implementation, and digital cognitive-behavioural therapy may assist delivery 
along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of 
patients responding insufficiently to cognitive-behavioural therapy for 
insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the 
brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators 
of treatment response/non-response and the associated development of tailored 
and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that 
treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to 
combat the global burden of mental disorders.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia, defined as repeated difficulties getting or staying 
asleep, is common in the general population. Such sleep difficulties are a 
problem in their own right, but increasingly it is being recognised that they 
may also be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental 
health problems. Our focus is upon the relationship between insomnia and 
psychotic experiences, such as paranoia and hallucinations. Psychotic 
experiences commonly occur in mild forms in the general population and have been 
linked to disrupted sleep. These psychotic-like experiences raise the risk of 
development of a clinical disorder. Our aim is to reduce insomnia in a large 
general population group, and examine the effect on paranoia and hallucinations 
at the age when mental health problems typically emerge. The primary hypotheses 
are that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for insomnia will reduce insomnia and 
also levels of paranoia and hallucinations. The theoretical links will be 
substantiated by a planned mediation analysis. Improvements in a number of other 
mental health outcomes are also predicted.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will carry out a parallel group, randomised controlled trial 
of 2,614 students with insomnia in universities across the UK. In the Oxford 
Access for Students Improving Sleep (OASIS) trial, participants will be 
randomised to digital CBT for insomnia (in addition to treatment as usual) or 
treatment as usual. Online assessments will take place at zero, three, 10 
(post-treatment), and 22 (follow-up) weeks. Primary outcomes are insomnia and 
psychotic-like experiences (paranoia or hallucinatory experiences) at 10 weeks. 
Secondary outcomes are levels of mania, depression, anxiety, nightmares, 
psychological wellbeing, and the development of mental health disorders. All 
main analyses will be carried out at the end of the last follow-up assessment 
and will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The trial is funded by 
the Wellcome Trust.
DISCUSSION: This study will be the first large-scale causal test of the 
relationship between sleep disturbance and psychotic experiences. It will 
provide evidence concerning the clinical effects of treating insomnia in young 
adults.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials

BACKGROUND: Worldwide prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is 
considered high; in Europe lifetime prevalence has been estimated at 4.3 to 
5.9%. High levels of anxiety disorders have been reported in university 
students, affecting 25 to 30% of the population. Young adults are some of the 
most vulnerable for the onset of mental health disorders and any stressors may 
act as a catalyst for their onset. The absence of resources can often mean that 
many do not seek treatment. Other factors that impede access to resources 
include such things as a lack of trained professionals, personal stigma, and 
waiting lists. Anxiety disorders can be treated successfully; indeed brief forms 
of cognitive-behavior therapy have been recommended. One potential avenue for 
research and development is that of delivering low-intensity interventions 
online for students with GAD. Therefore, the current study seeks to investigate 
the potential effectiveness for a low-intensity online CBT-based treatment for 
GAD in a service-based setting; implemented as one step in a stepped-care model.
METHODS/DESIGN: The research is a service-based effectiveness study utilizing a 
randomized waiting-list controlled design. The active intervention consists of 
six weekly modules of online CBT. Participants are assigned a supporter who 
provides weekly post-session feedback on progress and exercises. Participants 
will complete the GAD-7 as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes 
include pathological worry, depression and measures of well-being. At 
three-months follow-up data will be collected using the GAD-7, BDI-II, PSWQ, 
ED-Q5 and WSAS. Post-session data will be collected on significant in-session 
events in treatment (HAT). A satisfaction with treatment measure will be 
administered post-treatment (SAT).
DISCUSSION: The study will be a contribution to the potential for a 
low-intensity internet-delivered program implemented in a service-based setting; 
implemented as one step in a stepped-care model. The study will be a 
contribution to the already established work in online treatments for anxiety 
worldwide. The study will assess the utility of an innovative digital health 
solution (SilverCloud) to deliver such interventions.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive therapy has been shown to reduce fear of cancer recurrence 
(FCR), mainly in breast cancer survivors. The accessibility of cognitive 
behavioural interventions could be further improved by Internet delivery, but 
self-guided interventions have shown limited efficacy. The aim of this study is 
to test the efficacy of a therapist guided internet-delivered intervention 
(TG-iConquerFear) vs. augmented treatment as usual (aTAU) in Danish colorectal 
cancer survivors.
METHODS/DESIGN: A population-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 
TG-iConquerFear with aTAU (1:1) in n = 246 colorectal cancer survivors who 
suffer from clinically significant FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory 
Short Form (FCRI-SF) ≥ 22 and semi-structured interview). Evaluation will be 
conducted at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-treatment and between-group 
differences will be evaluated. Long-term effects will be evaluated after one 
year. Primary outcome will be post-treatment FCR (FCRI-SF). Secondary outcomes 
are global overall health and global quality of life (Visual Analogue Scales 
0-100), bodily distress syndrome (BDS checklist), health anxiety (Whiteley-6), 
anxiety (SCL4-anx), depression (SCL6-dep) and sickness absence and health 
expenditure (register data). Explanatory outcomes include: Uncertainty in 
illness (Mishels uncertainty of illness scale, short form, MUIS), metacognitions 
(MCQ-30 negative beliefs about worry subscale), and perceived risk of cancer 
recurrence (Visual analogue Scale 1-100).
DISCUSSION: This RCT will provide valuable information on the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of TG-iConquerFear vs. aTAU for CRC survivors with clinical 
FCR, as well as explanatory variables that may act as outcome moderators or 
mediators.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is globally recognized by the World Health Organization 
as the foremost risk factor for premature mortality. Individuals with mental 
disorders exhibit a notably heightened dependence on tobacco, approximately 
twice as high as that of the general population. The long-term effects of 
nicotine consumption include an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a 
decline in mental health, which can be considered additional risk factors for 
the vulnerable population of smokers with preexisting mental disorders. 
Successful smoking cessation is associated with an increase in mental health, 
comparable or superior to that of pharmacological antidepressant treatments. 
However, smoking is frequently disregarded within the realm of psychotherapeutic 
care, unlike in the treatment of other substance use disorders. Smoking may 
hinder patients' recovery and responsiveness to psychotherapy, potentially 
distorting improvements in symptom severity or negative affect. Integrating 
smoking cessation initiatives into standard psychotherapeutic interventions thus 
holds significant potential and may be considered essential for long-term mental 
health. The current study's objective is to assess the potential of a 
guideline-based smoking cessation intervention within an outpatient 
psychotherapeutic setting concerning changes in smoking intensity, nicotine 
dependence, and mental health outcomes among patients with a mental disorder 
adjunct to concurrent psychotherapy. This trial aims to bridge the gap between 
the state of research in light of evidence of the positive effects of successful 
smoking cessation and the actual practical provision of care in Germany.
METHODS: The effects of an intensified smoking cessation intervention versus a 
treatment-as-usual (TAU) control intervention on smokers' smoking intensity, 
nicotine dependence, and mental health symptoms related to a primary mental 
disorder will be examined in a single-center randomized controlled trial in an 
outpatient psychotherapeutic clinic using variance analysis methods. In this 
case, TAU is referred to as regular psychotherapy sessions without any 
additional smoking cessation treatment. The smoking intervention consists of a 
common guideline-based cognitive-behavioral program supplemented by a digital 
health application. Secondary outcomes include patients' motivation to quit, 
self-efficacy, and attitudes toward online interventions. Potential moderators 
or mediators will be investigated in exploratory analyses.
DISCUSSION: This study aims to elucidate the potential benefits of integrating 
smoking cessation interventions into standard psychotherapeutic treatment, akin 
to approaches used for other substance use disorders. While existing research 
highlights the positive impact of smoking cessation on mental health, its 
practical implications within the field of psychotherapy remain unclear. To 
address this gap, the current study examines the effectiveness of an intensive 
smoking cessation program alongside ongoing psychotherapy, focusing on both 
smoking status and mental health outcomes. By doing so, we aim to provide 
practical insights for psychotherapeutic providers regarding the integration of 
smoking cessation into comprehensive mental health care.

BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity (PA) is recommended to optimize weight and 
health outcomes in patients who have undergone metabolic and bariatric surgery 
(MBS). However, >70% of patients have low PA levels before MBS that persist 
after MBS. Although behavioral interventions delivered face-to-face have shown 
promise for increasing PA among patients who have undergone MBS, many may 
experience barriers, preventing enrollment into and adherence to such 
interventions. Delivering PA behavior change interventions via telehealth to 
patients who have undergone MBS may be an effective strategy to increase 
accessibility and reach, as well as adherence.
OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the protocol for a study that aims to assess the 
feasibility and acceptability of the protocol or methods and the Telehealth 
Bariatric Behavioral Intervention (TELE-BariACTIV). The intervention is designed 
to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) in patients awaiting 
bariatric surgery and is guided by a multitheory approach and a patient 
perspective. Another objective is to estimate the effect of the TELE-BariACTIV 
intervention on presurgical MVPA to determine the appropriate sample size for a 
multicenter trial.
METHODS: This study is a multicenter trial using a repeated (ABAB'A) single-case 
experimental design. The A phases are observational phases without intervention 
(A1=pre-MBS phase; A2=length personalized according to the MBS date; A3=7 months 
post-MBS phase). The B phases are interventional phases with PA counseling (B1=6 
weekly pre-MBS sessions; B2=3 monthly sessions starting 3 months after MBS). The 
target sample size is set to 12. Participants are inactive adults awaiting 
sleeve gastrectomy who have access to a computer with internet and an interface 
with a camera. The participants are randomly allocated to a 1- or 2-week 
baseline period (A1). Protocol and intervention feasibility and acceptability 
(primary outcomes) will be assessed by recording missing data, refusal, 
recruitment, retention, attendance, and attrition rates, as well as via 
web-based acceptability questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Data 
collected via accelerometry (7-14 days) on 8 occasions and via questionnaires on 
10 occasions will be analyzed to estimate the effect of the intervention on 
MVPA. Generalization measures assessing the quality of life, anxiety and 
depressive symptoms, and theory-based constructs (ie, motivational regulations 
for PA, self-efficacy to overcome barriers to PA, basic psychological needs 
satisfaction and frustration, PA enjoyment, and social support for PA; secondary 
outcomes for a future large-scale trial) will be completed via web-based 
questionnaires on 6-10 occasions. The institutional review board provided ethics 
approval for the study in June 2021.
RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2021, and all the participants were 
enrolled (n=12). Data collection is expected to end in fall 2023, depending on 
the MBS date of the recruited participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The TELE-BariACTIV intervention has the potential for 
implementation across multiple settings owing to its collaborative construction 
that can be offered remotely.

BACKGROUND: Procrastination, defined as irrational and voluntary delaying of 
necessary tasks, is widespread and clinically relevant. Its high prevalence 
among college students comes with serious consequences for mental health and 
well-being of those affected. Research for proper treatment is still relatively 
scarce and treatment of choice seems to be cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The 
aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of an 
internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) for procrastination based on CBT 
for college students.
METHODS: A two-armed randomized controlled trial with a calculated sample size 
of N = 120 participants with problematic procrastination behavior will be 
conducted. Students will be recruited in Germany, Austria and Switzerland via 
circular emails at 15+ cooperating universities in the framework of StudiCare, a 
well-established project that provides IMIs to college students for different 
health related issues. The intervention group will receive the e-coach guided 
5-week IMI StudiCare Procrastination. A waitlist-control group will get access 
to the unguided IMI 12 weeks after randomization. Assessments will take place 
before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after randomization. Primary outcome is 
procrastination, measured by the Irrational Procrastination Scale (IPS). 
Secondary outcomes include susceptibility to temptation, depression, anxiety, 
wellbeing and self-efficacy as well as acceptability aspects such as 
intervention satisfaction, adherence and potential side effects. Additionally, 
several potential moderators as well as the potential mediators self-efficacy 
and susceptibility to temptation will be examined exploratorily. Data-analysis 
will be performed on intention-to-treat basis.
DISCUSSION: This study will contribute to the evidence concerning effectiveness 
and acceptability of an intervention for procrastination delivered via the 
internet. If it shows to be effective, StudiCare Procrastination could provide a 
low-threshold, cost-efficient way to help the multitude of students suffering 
from problems caused by procrastination.Trial registration: The trial is 
registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the 
German Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS): DRKS00014321 (date of 
registration: 06.04.2018). In case of important protocol modifications, trial 
registration will be updated.Trial status: This is protocol version number 1, 
11th December 2019. Recruitment started 9th of April 2018 and was completed 30th 
of November 2018. Assessment and intervention are still ongoing and will be 
completed by April 2019.

BACKGROUND: A high number of individuals report suffering from physical and 
psychological sequelae symptoms after COVID-19-the so-called post COVID-19 
condition. Commonly reported complaints include physical symptoms such as 
fatigue, headache, attention and concentration deficits or dyspnea and anxiety, 
symptoms of post-traumatic stress, or depression. Evidence-based treatment 
recommendations are still lacking up to this point. Associations between 
physical and psychological symptoms in chronic diseases are known for a long 
time. Support in coping with the disease and improvement of self-efficacy can 
have a positive effect on the course of diseases. For this reason, we designed a 
randomized, controlled explorative intervention trial as a treatment of bodily 
distress disorder in COVID-19 recovered persons.
METHODS: Patients with a post COVID-19 condition meeting to the criteria of the 
WHO, along with a bodily distress disorder, are randomized in an intervention 
and control arm (TAU). Randomization takes place after a diagnostic interview, 
screening, and informed consent. In total, 60 patients will be included in the 
trial (30 per group). The intervention group receives a cognitive behavioral 
therapy as a video-conference-based group therapy (6 weeks) and mobile, 
respiratory biofeedback treatment (for 4 weeks). At several time points, both 
groups are assessed in terms of psychological and physical health status, 
treatment expectation, and satisfaction with the intervention. Furthermore, they 
will get biofeedback examination appointments. The primary outcome is the change 
in self-efficacy; secondary outcomes include assessed parameters of mental 
health, somatic symptoms, and satisfaction with the intervention. Data will be 
analyzed primarily using R and SPSS.
DISCUSSION: The randomized, controlled, explorative intervention trial POSITIV 
is one of the very first interventions for patients with post COVID-19 condition 
and psychological burden due to their different symptoms. The aim of the study 
is to generate new evidence and help patients to cope with the disease and thus, 
increase their quality of life and reduce symptomatology. We expect with a high 
probability that the patients' self-efficacy and health status will improve as a 
result of the intervention.

BACKGROUND: In European countries, including Switzerland, cannabis is the most 
commonly used illicit drug. Offering a Web-based self-help tool could 
potentially reach users who otherwise would not seek traditional help. However, 
such Web-based self-help tools often suffer from low adherence.
OBJECTIVE: Through adherence-focused guidance enhancements, the aim of this 
study was to increase adherence in cannabis users entering a Web-based self-help 
tool to reduce their cannabis use and, in this way, augment its effectiveness.
METHODS: This paper presents the protocol for a three-arm randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) to compare the effectiveness of (1) an adherence-focused, 
guidance-enhanced, Web-based self-help intervention with social presence; (2) an 
adherence-focused, guidance-enhanced, Web-based self-help intervention without 
social presence; and (3) a treatment-as-usual at reducing cannabis use in 
problematic users. The two active interventions, each spanning 6 weeks, consist 
of modules designed to reduce cannabis use and attenuate common mental disorder 
(CMD) symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorder 
symptoms based on the approaches of motivational interviewing and cognitive 
behavioral therapy. With a target sample size of 528, data will be collected at 
baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months after baseline. The primary outcome measurement 
will be the number of days of cannabis use on the preceding 7 days. Secondary 
outcomes will include the quantity of cannabis used in standardized cannabis 
joints, the severity of cannabis dependence, changes in CMD symptoms, and 
adherence to the program. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat 
principle and employ (generalized) linear mixed models.
RESULTS: The project commenced in August 2016; recruitment is anticipated to end 
by December 2018. First results are expected to be submitted for publication in 
summer 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide detailed insights on if and how the 
effectiveness of a Web-based self-help intervention aiming to reduce cannabis 
use in frequent cannabis users can be improved by theory-driven, 
adherence-focused guidance enhancement.

BACKGROUND: The increasing deployment of conversational artificial intelligence 
(AI) in mental health interventions necessitates an evaluation of their efficacy 
in rectifying cognitive biases and recognizing affect in human-AI interactions. 
These biases are particularly relevant in mental health contexts as they can 
exacerbate conditions such as depression and anxiety by reinforcing maladaptive 
thought patterns or unrealistic expectations in human-AI interactions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic chatbots 
(Wysa and Youper) versus general-purpose language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and 
Gemini Pro) in identifying and rectifying cognitive biases and recognizing 
affect in user interactions.
METHODS: This study used constructed case scenarios simulating typical user-bot 
interactions to examine how effectively chatbots address selected cognitive 
biases. The cognitive biases assessed included theory-of-mind biases 
(anthropomorphism, overtrust, and attribution) and autonomy biases (illusion of 
control, fundamental attribution error, and just-world hypothesis). Each chatbot 
response was evaluated based on accuracy, therapeutic quality, and adherence to 
cognitive behavioral therapy principles using an ordinal scale to ensure 
consistency in scoring. To enhance reliability, responses underwent a double 
review process by 2 cognitive scientists, followed by a secondary review by a 
clinical psychologist specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy, ensuring a 
robust assessment across interdisciplinary perspectives.
RESULTS: This study revealed that general-purpose chatbots outperformed 
therapeutic chatbots in rectifying cognitive biases, particularly in overtrust 
bias, fundamental attribution error, and just-world hypothesis. GPT-4 achieved 
the highest scores across all biases, whereas the therapeutic bot Wysa scored 
the lowest. Notably, general-purpose bots showed more consistent accuracy and 
adaptability in recognizing and addressing bias-related cues across different 
contexts, suggesting a broader flexibility in handling complex cognitive 
patterns. In addition, in affect recognition tasks, general-purpose chatbots not 
only excelled but also demonstrated quicker adaptation to subtle emotional 
nuances, outperforming therapeutic bots in 67% (4/6) of the tested biases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, while therapeutic chatbots hold promise for 
mental health support and cognitive bias intervention, their current 
capabilities are limited. Addressing cognitive biases in AI-human interactions 
requires systems that can both rectify and analyze biases as integral to human 
cognition, promoting precision and simulating empathy. The findings reveal the 
need for improved simulated emotional intelligence in chatbot design to provide 
adaptive, personalized responses that reduce overreliance and encourage 
independent coping skills. Future research should focus on enhancing affective 
response mechanisms and addressing ethical concerns such as bias mitigation and 
data privacy to ensure safe, effective AI-based mental health support.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol use and anxiety often co-occur, causing increased 
severity impairment. This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
that aims to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based, 
self-guided alcohol and anxiety-focused program, compared with a web-based brief 
alcohol-focused program, for young adults who drink at hazardous levels and 
experience anxiety. It will also test moderators and mechanisms of change 
underlying the intervention effects.
DESIGN: This RCT will be conducted with a 1:1 parallel group.
SETTING: The study will be a web-based trial in Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 17-30 years who drink alcohol at hazardous or 
greater levels and experience at least mild anxiety (n = 500) will be recruited 
through social media, media (TV, print) and community networks.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive 
a web-based, integrated alcohol-anxiety program plus technical and motivational 
telephone/e-mail support (intervention) or a web-based brief alcohol-feedback 
program (control).
MEASUREMENTS: Clinical measures will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention 
(2 months), 6 months (primary end-point), 12 months and 18 months. Co-primary 
outcomes are hazardous alcohol consumption and anxiety symptom severity. 
Secondary outcomes are binge-drinking frequency; alcohol-related consequences; 
depression symptoms; clinical diagnoses of alcohol use or anxiety disorder (at 
6 months post-intervention), health-care service use, educational and employment 
outcomes; and quality of life. Mediators and moderators will also be assessed. 
Efficacy will be tested using mixed models for repeated measures within an 
intention-to-treat framework. The economic evaluation will analyze 
individual-level health and societal costs and outcomes of participants between 
each trial arm, while mediation models will test for mechanisms of change.
COMMENTS: This will be the first trial to test whether a developmentally 
targeted, web-based, integrated alcohol-anxiety intervention is effective in 
reducing hazardous alcohol use and anxiety severity among young adults. If 
successful, the integrated alcohol-anxiety program will provide an accessible 
intervention that can be widely disseminated to improve wellbeing of young 
adults, at minimal cost.

INTRODUCTION: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) remain vulnerable to 
HIV-infection and significant co-morbid mental health challenges that are 
barriers to treatment and prevention efforts. Globally millions of AYA are 
living with HIV (AYALH) and/or have been affected by HIV in their families 
(AYAAH), with studies highlighting the need for mental health programmes. With 
no current guidelines for delivering mental health interventions for AYALH or 
AYAAH, a scoping review was undertaken to explore current evidence-based mental 
health interventions for AYALH and AYAAH to inform future work.
METHODS: The review, targeting work between 2014 and 2020, initially included 
studies of evidence-based mental health interventions for AYALH and AYAAH, ages 
10 to 24 years, that used traditional mental health treatments. Given the few 
studies identified, we expanded our search to include psychosocial interventions 
that had mental health study outcomes.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 13 studies, seven focused on AYALH, five 
on AYAAH, and one on both. Most studies took place in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Depression was targeted in eight studies with the remainder focused on a range 
of emotional and behavioural symptoms. Few studies used evidence-based 
approaches such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; psychosocial approaches included 
mental health treatments, group-based and family strengthening interventions, 
economic empowerment combined with family strengthening, group-based mindfulness 
and community interventions. Eleven studies were randomized control trials with 
four pilot studies. There was variation in sample size, treatment delivery mode 
(individual focus, group-based, family focus), and measures of effectiveness 
across studies. Most used trained lay counsellors as facilitators, with few 
using trained mental health professionals. Eleven studies reported positive 
intervention effects on mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for mental health interventions for AYALH and 
AYAAH, we know surprisingly little about mental health treatment for this 
vulnerable population. There are some promising approaches, but more work is 
needed to identify evidence-based approaches and corresponding mechanisms of 
change. Given limited resources, integrating mental health treatment into 
healthcare settings and using digital health approaches may support more 
standardized and scalable treatments. Greater emphasis on implementation science 
frameworks is needed to create sustainable mental health treatment for AYALH and 
AYAAH globally.

BACKGROUND: Social networking platforms offer a wide reach for public health 
interventions allowing communication with broad audiences using tools that are 
generally free and straightforward to use and may be combined with other 
components, such as public health policies. We define interactive social media 
as activities, practices, or behaviours among communities of people who have 
gathered online to interactively share information, knowledge, and opinions.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of interactive social media 
interventions, in which adults are able to communicate directly with each other, 
on changing health behaviours, body functions, psychological health, well-being, 
and adverse effects. Our secondary objective was to assess the effects of these 
interventions on the health of populations who experience health inequity as 
defined by PROGRESS-Plus. We assessed whether there is evidence about 
PROGRESS-Plus populations being included in studies and whether results are 
analysed across any of these characteristics.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE (including trial 
registries) and PsycINFO. We used Google, Web of Science, and relevant web sites 
to identify additional studies and searched reference lists of included studies. 
We searched for published and unpublished studies from 2001 until June 1, 2020. 
We did not limit results by language.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled 
before-and-after (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs). We included 
studies in which the intervention website, app, or social media platform 
described a goal of changing a health behaviour, or included a behaviour change 
technique. The social media intervention had to be delivered to adults via a 
commonly-used social media platform or one that mimicked a commonly-used 
platform. We included studies comparing an interactive social media intervention 
alone or as a component of a multi-component intervention with either a 
non-interactive social media control or an active but less-interactive social 
media comparator (e.g. a moderated versus an unmoderated discussion group). Our 
main outcomes were health behaviours (e.g. physical activity), body function 
outcomes (e.g. blood glucose), psychological health outcomes (e.g. depression), 
well-being, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were process outcomes 
important for behaviour change and included knowledge, attitudes, intention and 
motivation, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and social support.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used a pre-tested data extraction form and 
collected data independently, in duplicate. Because we aimed to assess broad 
outcomes, we extracted only one outcome per main and secondary outcome 
categories prioritised by those that were the primary outcome as reported by the 
study authors, used in a sample size calculation, and patient-important.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 88 studies (871,378 participants), of which 84 were 
RCTs, three were CBAs and one was an ITS. The majority of the studies were 
conducted in the USA (54%). In total, 86% were conducted in high-income 
countries and the remaining 14% in upper middle-income countries. The most 
commonly used social media platform was Facebook (39%) with few studies 
utilising other platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Google 
Hangouts. Many studies (48%) used web-based communities or apps that mimic 
functions of these well-known social media platforms. We compared studies 
assessing interactive social media interventions with non-interactive social 
media interventions, which included paper-based or in-person interventions or no 
intervention. We only reported the RCT results in our 'Summary of findings' 
table. We found a range of effects on health behaviours, such as breastfeeding, 
condom use, diet quality, medication adherence, medical screening and testing, 
physical activity, tobacco use, and vaccination. For example, these 
interventions may increase physical activity and medical screening tests but 
there was little to no effect for other health behaviours, such as improved diet 
or reduced tobacco use (20,139 participants in 54 RCTs). For body function 
outcomes, interactive social media interventions may result in small but 
important positive effects, such as a small but important positive effect on 
weight loss and a small but important reduction in resting heart rate (4521 
participants in 30 RCTs). Interactive social media may improve overall 
well-being (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.46, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.14 to 0.79, moderate effect, low-certainty evidence) demonstrated by an 
increase of 3.77 points on a general well-being scale (from 1.15 to 6.48 points 
higher) where scores range from 14 to 70 (3792 participants in 16 studies). We 
found no difference in effect on psychological outcomes (depression and 
distress) representing a difference of 0.1 points on a standard scale in which 
scores range from 0 to 63 points (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.12, low-certainty 
evidence, 2070 participants in 12 RCTs). We also compared studies assessing 
interactive social media interventions with those with an active but less 
interactive social media control (11 studies). Four RCTs (1523 participants) 
that reported on physical activity found an improvement demonstrated by an 
increase of 28 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week (from 
10 to 47 minutes more, SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59, small effect, very 
low-certainty evidence). Two studies found little to no difference in well-being 
for those in the intervention and control groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 
0.13, small effect, low-certainty evidence), demonstrated by a mean change of 
0.4 points on a scale with a range of 0 to 100. Adverse events related to the 
social media component of the interventions, such as privacy issues, were not 
reported in any of our included studies. We were unable to conduct planned 
subgroup analyses related to health equity as only four studies reported 
relevant data.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review combined data for a variety of outcomes and 
found that social media interventions that aim to increase physical activity may 
be effective and social media interventions may improve well-being. While we 
assessed many other outcomes, there were too few studies to compare or, where 
there were studies, the evidence was uncertain. None of our included studies 
reported adverse effects related to the social media component of the 
intervention. Future studies should assess adverse events related to the 
interactive social media component and should report on population 
characteristics to increase our understanding of the potential effect of these 
interventions on reducing health inequities.

BACKGROUND: The exponential growth of digital technologies and the ubiquity of 
social media platforms have led to unprecedented mental health challenges among 
college students, highlighting the critical need for effective intervention 
approaches.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between meeting the 
24-hour movement guidelines (24-HMG) health behavior combinations and the risk 
of social network addiction (SNA) as well as mental health issues among 
university students. It further sought to compare differences in mental health 
indicators and SNA levels across various risk groups and adherence patterns, and 
to identify the optimal 24-HMG health behavior intervention strategies for 
students at high risk of SNA.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited a total of 12,541 university 
students from the university town of Guizhou Province as participants. Data were 
collected through standardized questionnaires, including the Chinese version of 
Social Network Addiction Scale for College Students (SNAS-C), the adult 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) self-report scale (ASRS), and 
the Chinese version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Self-Report Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom 
Measure for Adults (DSM-5 CCSM), among others. The primary analytical method 
used was the random forest model, which was used to explore the relationship 
between different 24-HMG behavior combinations and mental health variables among 
student at high-risk of SNA. In addition, the study aimed to identify the 
optimal 24-HMG health behavior intervention strategies for this high-risk group.
RESULTS: Participants in the meeting none group exhibited the highest SNA scores 
(57.98), which declined progressively with greater adherence. Among 
single-guideline groups, meeting physical activity (PA; 53.07) and meeting 
sedentary time (ST; 52.72) showed similar scores. Further reductions were seen 
in meeting PA+ST (49.68), meeting sleep (48.44), and meeting ST+sleep (44.75), 
with the lowest in meeting PA+ST+sleep. Approximately 6% of the variance in SNA 
was attributable to differences in adherence patterns (η²=0.06). Students 
meeting all three 24-HMG components-PA, sleep, and ST-demonstrated the strongest 
protection against attention deficit, depression, and anxiety. All 24-HMG 
behaviors were inversely associated with mental health symptoms, except academic 
satisfaction, which was positively correlated. Random forest modeling identified 
meeting sleep+ST as the most impactful for mania (0.4491), sleep disturbance 
(0.4032), personality (0.3924), and dissociation (0.3832). Meeting ST alone 
showed the strongest effects on substance (0.6176) and alcohol use (0.6597). 
Depression was influenced by meeting sleep+ST (0.2053), meeting PA+ST+sleep 
(0.1650), and meeting PA+ST (0.1634). The model achieved high accuracy for ASRS 
(0.912; F1-score=0.927), with robust predictions for substance use 
(F1-score=0.873) and mania (F1-score=0.836).
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the health behaviors recommended by the 24-HMG can 
significantly improve the mental health outcomes of university students at high 
risk for SNA. The findings of this study support the development of mental 
health intervention strategies for students at high-risk of SNA based on the 
24-HMG framework.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a highly prevalent disorder associated with numerous 
adverse health outcomes. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is 
recommended as first-line treatment by clinical guidelines but is accessible to 
only a minority of patients suffering from insomnia. Internet-delivered CBT-I 
(iCBT-I) could contribute to the widespread dissemination of this first-line 
treatment. As there is insufficient evidence regarding non-inferiority, this 
study directly aims to compare therapist-guided internet-delivered versus 
face-to-face CBT-I in terms of insomnia severity post-treatment. Furthermore, a 
health-economic evaluation will be conducted, and potential benefits and 
disadvantages of therapist-guided iCBT-I will be examined.
METHODS: This study protocol describes a randomised controlled two-arm 
parallel-group non-inferiority trial comparing therapist-guided iCBT-I with 
face-to-face CBT-I in routine clinical care. A total of 422 patients with 
insomnia disorder will be randomised and treated at 16 study centres throughout 
Germany. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 10 weeks after randomisation 
(post), and 6 months after randomisation (follow-up). The primary outcome is 
insomnia severity measured using the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary outcomes 
include depression-related symptoms, quality of life, fatigue, physical 
activity, daylight exposure, adverse events related to treatment, and a 
health-economic evaluation. Finally, potential moderator variables and several 
descriptive and exploratory outcomes will be assessed (e.g. benefits and 
disadvantages of internet-delivered treatment).
DISCUSSION: The widespread implementation of CBT-I is a significant healthcare 
challenge. The non-inferiority of therapist-guided iCBT-I versus face-to-face 
CBT-I will be investigated in an adequately powered sample in routine clinical 
care, with the same therapeutic content and same level of therapist 
qualifications provided with both interventions. If this trial demonstrates the 
non-inferiority of therapist-guided iCBT-I, healthcare providers may be more 
confident recommending this treatment to their patients, contributing to the 
wider dissemination of CBT-I.

BACKGROUND: University students are vulnerable to poor mental health, 
psychological distress, and loneliness relative to nonuniversity student peers. 
However, the rate of seeking mental health treatment among university students 
is low. Web-based psychological interventions may provide an opportunity for 
supporting vulnerable university students who are unlikely to otherwise seek 
support.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, 
safety, and efficacy of an existing web-based transdiagnostic cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) mental health program for use among Australian 
university students.
METHODS: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a self-directed 
web-based CBT mental health program with a waitlist control. The self-directed 
modules will be augmented with optional webchat or telephone coaching with a 
therapist. The recruitment target is 70 university students who do not present 
with a clinical mental health disorder. Allocation will be made in a 1:1 ratio 
and will occur after the initial baseline assessment. Assessments will be 
completed at baseline, upon completion of a 4-week waitlist (waitlist group 
only), upon completion of the program, and at 3 months after completion of the 
program.
RESULTS: The trial was funded in June 2018, and the protocol was approved by the 
Swinburne University Human Research Ethics Committee in September 2018. 
Recruitment commenced in October 2018, with the first participant allocated in 
November 2018. A total of 70 participants were recruited to the trial. The trial 
recruitment ceased in June 2019, and data collection was finalized in December 
2019. We expect the final data analysis to be completed by November 2020 and 
results to be published early in 2021. The primary outcomes are feasibility, 
acceptability, safety, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. The 
secondary outcomes are psychological wellbeing, quality of life, loneliness, 
self-reported physical health status, emotion regulation, and cognitive and 
mindfulness processes.
CONCLUSIONS: The acceptability, feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a web-based 
mental health program in university students will be evaluated. Web-based mental 
health programs offer the opportunity to engage university students who may be 
reluctant to seek support through traditional face-to-face mental health 
services, and the transdiagnostic approach of the program has the potential to 
address the breadth of mental health concerns of university students.

BACKGROUND: Cancer imposes significant physical and emotional distress not only 
on patients, but also on their caregivers. In recent years, there has been a 
growing focus on the mental and physical well-being of caregivers. Among various 
psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is widely 
recognized as one of the most effective approaches. However, traditional CBT is 
often limited by time and geographical constraints, resulting in delayed or 
inefficient support for caregivers. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
(ICBT) presents a valuable alternative for alleviating the caregiving burden and 
the negative emotions experienced by caregivers.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide a scoping review of ICBT interventions 
for caregivers of patients with cancer, examining intervention content, outcome 
measures, and effectiveness and to offer insights and references for the 
development and clinical applications of ICBT programs tailored to caregivers of 
patients with cancer in China.
METHODS: Relevant literature was systematically searched in PubMed, Web of 
Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and VIP Chinese Journal Database. The 
search timeframe was from database inception to June 6, 2024. Inclusion criteria 
encompassed intervention studies that implemented cognitive behavioral therapy 
for caregivers of patients with cancer via the internet, WeChat (Tencent), or 
mobile electronic devices. This category includes both randomized and 
nonrandomized controlled trials.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the criteria and were included in the review. 
The intervention content included the following components: treatment initiation 
and brief introduction (5/12, 41%), cognitive education and restructuring (7/12, 
58%), emotional expression and coping (6/12, 50%), cognitive restructuring and 
reinforcement (4/12, 33%), behavioral training and activation (9/12, 75%), 
problem-solving techniques (4/12, 33%), communication (5/12, 41%), and 
completion of treatment with follow-up consolidation (3/12, 25%). The 
intervention duration typically ranged from 6 to 8 weeks. Outcome indicators 
encompassed feasibility and acceptability, anxiety, depression, caregiver 
burden, and quality of life. ICBT demonstrated positive effects for caregivers 
of patients with cancer. Most intervention programs were feasible and 
acceptable, with 2 out of 5 feasibility studies reporting recruitment rates 
below 50%. Attrition rates across studies ranged from 3% to 16%, and caregivers 
expressed satisfaction with the information, quality, and skills provided. ICBT 
exhibits a moderate effect in diminishing negative emotions among caregivers and 
alleviating caregiver stress. However, its impact on improving quality of life 
is not statistically significant, underscoring the need for long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of ICBT for caregivers of patients with cancer 
has demonstrated beneficial outcomes, attributed to its practicality and 
flexibility, which contribute to its greater acceptance among caregivers. 
Nevertheless, there is significant heterogeneity in intervention format, 
duration, and outcome indicators. It is necessary to develop optimal 
intervention strategies and secure online platforms based on the cultural 
background in China to improve the quality of life of caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered cognitive therapy for social anxiety disorder 
(iCT-SAD), which is a therapist-guided modular web-based treatment, has shown 
strong efficacy and acceptability in English-language randomized controlled 
trials in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. However, it is not yet known whether 
iCT-SAD can retain its efficacy following linguistic translation and cultural 
adaptation of treatment contents and implementation in other countries such as 
Japan.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the preliminary efficacy and 
acceptability of the translated and culturally adapted iCT-SAD in Japanese 
clinical settings.
METHODS: This multicenter, single-arm trial recruited 15 participants with 
social anxiety disorder. At the time of recruitment, participants were receiving 
usual psychiatric care but had not shown improvement in their social anxiety and 
required additional treatment. iCT-SAD was provided in combination with usual 
psychiatric care for 14 weeks (treatment phase) and for a subsequent 3-month 
follow-up phase that included up to 3 booster sessions. The primary outcome 
measure was the self-report version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. The 
secondary outcome measures examined social anxiety-related psychological 
processes, taijin kyofusho (the fear of offending others), depression, 
generalized anxiety, and general functioning. The assessment points for the 
outcome measures were baseline (week 0), midtreatment (week 8), posttreatment 
(week 15; primary assessment point), and follow-up (week 26). Acceptability was 
measured using the dropout rate from the treatment, the level of engagement with 
the program (the rate of module completion), and participants' feedback about 
their experience with the iCT-SAD.
RESULTS: Evaluation of the outcome measures data showed that iCT-SAD led to 
significant improvements in social anxiety symptoms during the treatment phase 
(P<.001; Cohen d=3.66), and these improvements were maintained during the 
follow-up phase. Similar results were observed for the secondary outcome 
measures. At the end of the treatment phase, 80% (12/15) of participants 
demonstrated reliable improvement, and 60% (9/15) of participants demonstrated 
remission from social anxiety. Moreover, 7% (1/15) of participants dropped out 
during treatment, and 7% (1/15) of participants declined to undergo the 
follow-up phase after completing the treatment. No serious adverse events 
occurred. On average, participants completed 94% of the modules released to 
them. Participant feedback was positive and highlighted areas of strength in 
treatment, and it included further suggestions to improve suitability for 
Japanese settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Translated and culturally adapted iCT-SAD demonstrated promising 
initial efficacy and acceptability for Japanese clients with social anxiety 
disorder. A randomized controlled trial is required to examine this more 
robustly.

BACKGROUND: One-third or more of breast cancer survivors report stress and other 
psychological and physical complaints that can negatively impact their quality 
of life. Psychosocial stress management interventions, shown to mitigate the 
negative impact of these complaints, can now be delivered as accessible and 
convenient (for the patient and provider) eHealth interventions. In this 
randomized controlled trial (RCT), Coping After Breast Cancer (CABC), 2 modified 
versions of the stress management eHealth intervention program StressProffen 
were created: one with predominantly cognitive behavioral stress management 
content (StressProffen-cognitive behavioral therapy intervention 
[StressProffen-CBI]) and another with predominantly mindfulness-based stress 
management content (StressProffen-mindfulness-based intervention 
[StressProffen-MBI]).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects in breast cancer survivors 
of using StressProffen-CBI and StressProffen-MBI compared with a control group 
(treatment as usual).
METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I-III, unequivocally human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative 
tumors) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) aged 21-69 years who completed the 
Cancer Registry of Norway-initiated health survey on quality of life are invited 
to the CABC trial about 7 months after diagnosis. Women who give consent to 
participate are randomized (1:1:1) to either the StressProffen-CBI, 
StressProffen-MBI, or control group. Both StressProffen interventions consist of 
10 modules of stress management content delivered through text, sound, video, 
and images. The primary outcome is between-group changes in perceived stress at 
6 months, assessed with Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. The secondary 
outcomes comprise changes in quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue, 
sleep, neuropathy, coping, mindfulness, and work-related outcomes approximately 
1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis. Long-term effects of the interventions on 
work participation, comorbidities, relapse or new cancers, and mortality will be 
assessed using data from national health registries.
RESULTS: Recruitment is scheduled from January 2021 to May 2023. The goal is to 
recruit 430 participants (100 in each group). As of April 14 2023, 428 
participants have been enrolled.
CONCLUSIONS: The CABC trial is possibly the largest ongoing psychosocial eHealth 
RCT in patients with breast cancer. If 1 or both interventions prove to be 
effective in reducing stress and improving psychosocial and physical complains, 
the StressProffen eHealth interventions could be beneficial, inexpensive, and 
easily implementable tools for breast cancer survivors when coping with late 
effects after cancer and cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND: Burnout is a hidden productivity killer in organizations. Finding a 
solution to efficiently measure and proactively prevent or rehabilitate 
employees with burnout is a challenge. To meet this unabated demand, companies 
and caregivers can focus on proactive measures to prevent "Burnout as an 
Occupational Phenomenon."
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to address effectiveness, reliability, and validity of the 
empowerment for participation (EFP) batch of assessments to measure burnout risk 
in relation to the efficacy of web-based interventions using cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) and floating to improve mental health and well-being. 
We introduced three risk assessments: risk for burnout, risk of anxiety, and 
risk for depression.
METHODS: We used an interventional, empirical, and parallel design using raw EFP 
psychometric data to measure the effectiveness of web-based therapy to reduce 
the risk of burnout between a control group and web-based therapy group. A total 
of 50 participants were selected. The rehabilitation and control groups 
consisted of 25 normally distributed employees each. The rehabilitation group 
received therapy, whereas the control group had not yet received any form of 
therapy. IBM SPSS was used to analyze the data collected, and a repeated 
measures ANOVA, an analysis of covariance, a discriminant analysis, and a 
construct validity analysis were used to test for reliability and validity. The 
group was selected from a list of employees within the My-E-Health ecosystem who 
showed a moderate or high risk for burnout. All assessments and mixed-method CBT 
were web-based, and floating was conducted at designated locations. The complete 
EFP assessment was integrated into a digital ecosystem designed for this purpose 
and therapy, offering a secure and encrypted ecosystem.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between pre- and 
postassessment scores for burnout. The reliability of the burnout measure was 
good (Cronbach α=.858; mean 1.826, SD 3.008; Cohen d=0.607; P<.001) with a high 
validity of 0.9420. A paired samples 2-tailed test showed a good t score of 
4.292 and P<.001, with a good effect size, Cohen d=0.607. Web-based therapy 
reduced the risk for burnout in participants compared with the control group. 
Tests of between-subject effects show F=16.964, a significant difference between 
the control group and the web-based therapy group: P<.001, with movement between 
the group variables of 0.261 or 26.1% for the dependent variable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests good reliability and validity of using 
web-based interventional mixed methods CBT to reduce the risk of burnout. The 
EFP batch of web-based assessments could reliably identify morbidity risk levels 
and successfully measure clinical interventions and rehabilitation with 
consistently reliable results to serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool 
worthy of major research in the future.

INTRODUCTION: Therapist-supported internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
(ICBT) has strong scientific support, but all patients are not helped, and 
further improvements are needed. Personalized medicine could enhance ICBT. One 
promising approach uses a Machine learning (ML) based predictive decision 
support tool (DST) to help therapists identify patients at risk of treatment 
failure and adjust their treatments accordingly. ICBT is a suitable clinical 
context for developing and testing such predictive DST's, since its delivery is 
quite flexible and can quickly be adapted for probable non-responders, for 
example by increasing the level and nature of therapist support, to avoid 
treatment failures and improve overall outcomes. This type of strategy has never 
been tested in a triple-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) and has rarely 
been studied in ICBT.The aim of this protocol is to expand on previous 
registered protocols with more detailed descriptions of methods and analyses 
before analyses is being conducted.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A triple blind RCT comparing ICBT with a DST (DST 
condition), to ICBT as usual (TAU condition). The primary objective is to 
evaluate if the DST condition is superior to the TAU condition in decreasing 
diagnose-specific symptoms among patients identified to be at risk of failure. 
Secondary objectives are to evaluate if the DST improves functioning, 
interaction, adherence, patient satisfaction, and therapist time efficiency and 
decreases the number of failed treatments. Additionally, we will investigate the 
therapists' experience of using the DST.Patients and therapists have been 
recruited nationally. They were randomised and given a sham rationale for the 
trial to ensure allocation blindness. The total number of patients included was 
401, and assessments were administered pre-treatment, weekly during treatment, 
at post-treatment and at 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome is one of the three 
diagnosis-specific symptom rating scales for respective treatment and primary 
analysis is difference in change from pre- to post-treatment for at-risk 
patients on these scales.
HUMAN ETHICS AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Informed consent to participate in the 
study was obtained from all participants. Both therapists and patients are 
participants in this trial. For patients, informed consent to participate in the 
study was obtained when they registered interest for the study via the study's 
secure web platform and carried out initial screening before the diagnostic and 
fit for treatment assessment, they first received the research subject 
information and were asked for consent by digitally signing that they had read 
and understood the information. For therapists who were part of the study, 
consent was requested after they had registered their interest. Therapists then 
received an email with a link to the study's secure web platform with the 
research person's information and were asked for consent by digitally signing 
that they had read and understood the information. All documents are stored in 
secure, locked filing cabinets on the clinic's premises or on a secure digital 
consent database.

BACKGROUND: There is huge variability in the way that individuals with tinnitus 
respond to interventions. These experiential variations, together with a range 
of associated etiologies, contribute to tinnitus being a highly heterogeneous 
condition. Despite this heterogeneity, a "one size fits all" approach is taken 
when making management recommendations. Although there are various management 
approaches, not all are equally effective. Psychological approaches such as 
cognitive behavioral therapy have the most evidence base. Managing tinnitus is 
challenging due to the significant variations in tinnitus experiences and 
treatment successes. Tailored interventions based on individual tinnitus 
profiles may improve outcomes. Predictive models of treatment success are, 
however, lacking.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use exploratory data mining techniques (ie, 
decision tree models) to identify the variables associated with the treatment 
success of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus.
METHODS: Individuals (N=228) who underwent ICBT in 3 separate clinical trials 
were included in this analysis. The primary outcome variable was a reduction of 
13 points in tinnitus severity, which was measured by using the Tinnitus 
Functional Index following the intervention. The predictor variables included 
demographic characteristics, tinnitus and hearing-related variables, and 
clinical factors (ie, anxiety, depression, insomnia, hyperacusis, hearing 
disability, cognitive function, and life satisfaction). Analyses were undertaken 
by using various exploratory machine learning algorithms to identify the most 
influencing variables. In total, 6 decision tree models were implemented, namely 
the classification and regression tree (CART), C5.0, GB, XGBoost, AdaBoost 
algorithm and random forest models. The Shapley additive explanations framework 
was applied to the two optimal decision tree models to determine relative 
predictor importance.
RESULTS: Among the six decision tree models, the CART (accuracy: mean 70.7%, SD 
2.4%; sensitivity: mean 74%, SD 5.5%; specificity: mean 64%, SD 3.7%; area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: mean 0.69, SD 0.001) and 
gradient boosting (accuracy: mean 71.8%, SD 1.5%; sensitivity: mean 78.3%, SD 
2.8%; specificity: 58.7%, SD 4.2%; AUC: mean 0.68, SD 0.02) models were found to 
be the best predictive models. Although the other models had acceptable accuracy 
(range 56.3%-66.7%) and sensitivity (range 68.6%-77.9%), they all had relatively 
weak specificity (range 31.1%-50%) and AUCs (range 0.52-0.62). A higher 
education level was the most influencing factor for ICBT outcomes. The CART 
decision tree model identified 3 participant groups who had at least an 85% 
success probability following the undertaking of ICBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision tree models, especially the CART and gradient boosting 
models, appeared to be promising in predicting ICBT outcomes. Their predictive 
power may be improved by using larger sample sizes and including a wider range 
of predictive factors in future studies.

Gambling Disorder is a prevalent non-substance use disorder, which contrasts 
with the low number of people requesting treatment. Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT) could help to enhance the dissemination of 
evidence-based treatments and considerably reduce the costs. The current study 
seeks to assess the efficacy of an online psychological intervention for people 
suffering from gambling problems in Spain. The proposed study will be a two-arm, 
parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. A total of 134 participants 
(problem and pathological gamblers) will be randomly allocated to a waiting list 
control group (N = 67) or an intervention group (N = 67). The intervention 
program includes 8 modules, and it is based on motivational interviewing, 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and extensions and innovations of CBT. It 
includes several complementary tools that are present throughout the entire 
intervention. Therapeutic support will be provided once a week through a phone 
call with a maximum length of 10 min. The primary outcome measure will be 
gambling severity and gambling-related cognitions, and secondary outcome 
measures will be readiness to change, and gambling self-efficacy. Other 
variables that will be considered are depression and anxiety symptoms, positive 
and negative affect, difficulties in emotion regulation strategies, impulsivity, 
and quality of life. Individuals will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 
and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. During the treatment, participants will 
also respond to a daily Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) in order to 
evaluate urges to gamble, self-efficacy to cope with gambling urges, gambling 
urge frequency, and whether gambling behaviour occurs. The EMI includes 
immediate automatic feedback depending on the participant's responses. Treatment 
acceptance and satisfaction will also be assessed. The data will be analysed 
both per protocol and by Intention-to-treat. As far as we know, this is the 
first randomized controlled trial of an online psychological intervention for 
gambling disorder in Spain. It will expand our knowledge about treatments 
delivered via the Internet and contribute to improving treatment dissemination, 
reaching people suffering from this problem who otherwise would not receive 
help.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a major contributor to health loss. Many persons with 
harmful use or alcohol dependence do not obtain treatment because of limited 
availability or stigma. They may use internet-based interventions as an 
alternative way of obtaining support. Internet-based interventions have 
previously been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption in studies 
that included hazardous use; however, few studies have been conducted with a 
specific focus on harmful use or alcohol dependence. The importance of therapist 
guidance in internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) programs is still 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This trial aims to investigate the effects of a web-based alcohol 
program with or without therapist guidance among anonymous adult help-seekers.
METHODS: A three-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare 
therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT with an information-only control 
condition. Swedish-speaking adult internet users with alcohol dependence (3 or 
more International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision criteria) or 
harmful alcohol use (alcohol use disorder identification test>15) were included 
in the study. Participants in the therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT 
groups had 12-week access to a program consisting of 5 main modules, as well as 
a drinking calendar with automatic feedback. Guidance was given by experienced 
therapists trained in motivational interviewing. The primary outcome measure was 
weekly alcohol consumption in standard drinks (12 g of ethanol). Secondary 
outcomes were alcohol-related problems measured using the total alcohol use 
disorder identification test-score, diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence 
and alcohol use disorder, depression, anxiety, health, readiness to change, and 
access to other treatments or support. Follow-up was conducted 3 (posttreatment) 
and 6 months after recruitment.
RESULTS: During the recruitment period, from March 2015 to March 2017, 1169 
participants were included. Participants had a mean age of 45 (SD 13) years, and 
56.72% (663/1169) were women. At the 3-month follow-up, the therapist-guided 
ICBT and control groups differed significantly in weekly alcohol consumption 
(-3.84, 95% Cl -6.53 to -1.16; t417=2.81; P=.005; Cohen d=0.27). No significant 
differences were found in weekly alcohol consumption between the self-help ICBT 
group and the therapist-guided ICBT at 3 months, between the self-help ICBT and 
the control group at 3 months, or between any of the groups at the 6-month 
follow-up. A limitation of the study was the large number of participants who 
were completely lost to follow-up (477/1169, 40.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a therapist-guided ICBT program was not found to be 
more effective than the same program in a self-help ICBT version for reducing 
alcohol consumption or other alcohol-related outcomes. In the short run, 
therapist-guided ICBT was more effective than information. Only some internet 
help-seekers may need a multisession program and therapist guidance to change 
their drinking when they use internet-based interventions.

BACKGROUND: Self-harm (SH; intentional self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, 
often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader 
Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now 
split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial 
interventions in adults who engage in self-harm.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus 
treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, 
in adults following SH.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) 
trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 
2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: 
the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), 
and PsycINFO (1967 to date).
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with 
treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in 
adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation 
to clinical services.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane's standard methodological 
procedures.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. 
Eighteen trials investigated cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy 
(CBT-based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive-behavioural, problem-solving 
therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of 
SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion-regulation group-based 
psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four 
investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions 
(postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were 
evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality.There was 
a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy compared to TAU at 
final follow-up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 
0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 
2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH 
(mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.26; k = 6; N = 594; GRADE: low 
quality).For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of 
multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group-based 
emotion-regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with 
significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group-based 
emotion-regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; 
GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 
134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy 
(DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow-up (MD 
-18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95; k = 3; N = 292; GRADE: low quality) but not in 
the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; 
N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological 
therapy, DBT-oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment 
effect for repetition of SH at final follow-up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k 
= 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' 
(OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k = 1; N = 97; GRADE: very low quality) nor 
prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k 
= 1; N =18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in 
repetition of SH.Case management was not associated with a significant reduction 
in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced 
usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate 
quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was 
also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 
95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k = 1; N = 136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the 
following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants 
repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 
1.02; k = 1; N = 391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions 
(comprising psychological therapy and remote contact-based interventions) (OR 
0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including 
a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k 
= 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k = 
4; N = 3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 
2.14; k = 2; N = 1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 
1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone 
contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N = 840; GRADE: very low quality), 
and mobile telephone-based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero 
cell counts; GRADE: low quality).None of the following mixed interventions were 
associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of 
psychological therapy: interpersonal problem-solving skills training, behaviour 
therapy, home-based problem-solving therapy, long-term psychotherapy; or to TAU: 
provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive 
inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive 
outpatient treatment.We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention 
had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than 
planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: CBT-based psychological therapy can result in fewer 
individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using 
GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy 
for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead 
to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality 
evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to 
have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic 
approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low 
quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive.
