Health Canada,"Home-based Non-invasive Brain Stimulation for Treatment-resistant Depression: Feasibility, Efficacy and Biomarker of Treatment Response",,,2023,15.Jun.23,Clinical Trial,used by healthcare professionals worldwide. It has acquired e.g. CE,"Brief SummaryDepression has a yearly prevalence superior to 5%, but a 30% of patients cannot benefit of pharmacological treatment, resulting resistant to it. Transcranial direct current stimulation, due to its reduced invasiveness and easy administration showed to be a useful technique to treat these cases, and it is now broadly used in clinical practice. Moreover, thanks to technological advances, this treatment could be self-administered at home, reducing costs and improving scalability. The aim of this study is to confirm the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a home-based intervention for treatment-resistant depression To do this participants will perform a home-based tDCS intervention consisting of 30 minutes sessions, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Results should provide critical knowledge regarding home-based therapies for the treatment of resistant depression and evidence on brain mechanisms underlying response to non-invasive brain stimulation.Detailed DescriptionMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly disabling pathology with an important prevalence along the whole lifespan. Its global prevalence is around 5% of the population and it has been estimated that depression represents the third cause of worldwide disability causing an enormous social and economic impact. While a significant proportion of patients with MDD show clinical responses to first line pharmacological interventions, almost 30% of cases exhibit resistance to medications, and fail to gain remission of symptoms when administered with antidepressants. This condition, termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defines patients where treatment with two or more products of different pharmacological classes used for a sufficient length of time at an adequate dose, fails to induce a clinically meaningful effect (inadequate response). TRD worsens the personal, social, and economic impact of depression and TRD patients, compared to non-TRD patients, reported reduced quality of life, reduced physical and mental health, presenting important impairments in daily life activities. Furthermore, for these patients, healthcare resources and costs are also significantly higher. To treat these patients in the last decades various alternative therapeutic approaches have been developed. Between them non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) demonstrated to be a safe and effective procedure that successfully reduces and mitigates major depression symptoms. Amongst the different techniques, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the more studied and promising approaches, as it can modulate cortical activity related to cognitive control dysfunction in MDD. In tDCS, surface electrodes (anode and cathode) inject low-amplitude direct current through the scalp to modulate brain activity and excitability, with regulatory effects impacting not only the brain areas stimulated but also at the level of brain networks, and therefore with the potentiality of 'optimizing' the balance between integration and segregation of associated functions, commonly observed in neuropsychiatric conditions. In recent years, tDCS showed to be safe and generally well-tolerated when appropriate safety guidelines are followed, and has demonstrated a moderate but consistent effect in depression treatment. Crucially, recent tDCS systems are highly portable and easy to set-up, with the possibility to be configurated remotely, potentially allowing the administration of remotely supervised non-pharmacological treatments at home, facilitating long duration treatments adherence. Recently, scientific interest in the application of home-based tDCS to a variety of clinical conditions has increased progressively, and regarding to depression. This potentially represents a very relevant step forward in the treatment of TRD, making it very scalable and highly feasible for people living far from clinical facilities, with displacement difficulties or considering exceptional situations as the COVID-19 pandemic that on one hand absorbed most healthcare resources and on the other impose to people to eliminate or reduce mobility. Aim: The aim of this study is to confirm the efficacy and feasibility of a home-based intervention for treatment-resistant depression Hypothesis: The specific hypothesis is that it is feasible and effective to implement a self-administered home-based therapeutic intervention to reduce or eliminate depressive symptoms. Material and Methods: Design The investigators will implement an home-based brain stimulation treatment using tDCS in people suffering from TRD. The stimulation will be administered in collaboration with a familiar (companion) that will participate, together with the patients, in a training on tDCS administration before the beginning of the treatment. Moreover, the treatment will be preceded and followed by pre and post assessments. Participants The investigators will enroll 40 participants, over 18 years old. Sample size has been calculated considering the effect size of the few previous studies investigating the modulatory effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on behavioral outcomes of depression (Hedge's g = 0.3-0.76). Sample sizes needed for the type of analysis presented in the ""statistical approach section"" (F statistics as repeated measure ANOVA, logistic and linear regressions, etc..), considering alpha=0.05 and statistical power (1-beta) =0.80, for the interventional study to be conducted is estimated to be of 40 participants, considering a 10-15% drop-out. Companion training Before beginning the intervention the investigators will undertake a first in-person training session, followed by remote training and supervision program, for companions that will administer the stimulation. These training sessions will have the aim to instruct about ,and assure, the correct administration of the stimulation. The program will be based on three main pillars: an in-depth training curriculum about tDCS and instructions on how to administer the stimulation, a set of remote practice sessions hosted by trained research staff for study companions to promptly apply the knowledge and skills derived from the training curriculum, and an on-demand remote assistance infrastructure to provide additional support and guidance to study companions as needed. Pre-Post assessment Before and after the stimulation protocol participants will be administered with questionnaires and scales to evaluate our main outcomes. Efficacy outcomes Participants will be administered with the Montgomery-횇sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the patient participant-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Moreover, participants will also be cognitively assessed with a cognitive screening and regarding their quality of life with the administration of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form. The investigators also administer a cognitive screening using the ""Guttmann Cognitest""digital solution, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for self-administered cognitive testing. Feasibility outcomes To assess feasibility of the treatment the investigators will evaluate the adherence to the intervention in terms of compliance of scheduled sessions measuring the decreasing of electrode impedance and the number of aborted sessions due to high electrodes impedance. tDCS study protocol: general montage and configuration procedures Stimulation will consist of 20 sessions over three consecutive weeks (from Monday to Friday), each session lasting for 30 minutes, following a protocol broadly used in various clinical centers and approved for depression treatment. The stimulation will target the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), consistently previously identified as target for tDCS depression treatment. Current will be supplied in a constantly for 30 minutes and will be initially increased and finally decreased in a 30 s ramp-up and ramp-down fashion. All stimulation parameters adhere to general transcranial electrical stimulation current safety criteria guidelines and for safety issues, the maximum current delivered will be 2 ma. Stimulation will be delivered via ""Sooma tDCS?? medical device"
but will also generate data to inform an existing gap in scientific literature: understanding of concussion recovery patterns. Analysis of the data will facilitate a better understanding of the patterns that exist between symptoms and everyday activity. In turn,Efficacy of the Pacing and Planning App for Persons With Mild Acquired Brain Injury,,,2019,17.May.19,Clinical Trial,the investigators plan to conduct a large-scale evaluation trial to demonstrate the effectiveness of the app more fulsomely. Completing this process will not only provide evidence related to the effectiveness of the app,"Brief SummaryIn efforts to assist people who have had a concussion (mild traumatic brain injury), the Parkwood Pacing and Planning??app has been developed and tested and will be released to the public. The app uses a point system where users have a daily point maximum assigned based on symptom severity with daily activities (recorded by the users). Users can then schedule their daily activities based on their allowed points. The goal is to help users with symptom self-management by facilitating activity planning and pacing. Patients and clinicians have provided positive feedback on the initial version of the app. Using this as a foundation, the investigators envision enhancing the app to provide a more personalized user experience and to enable further discovery and innovations in the recovery from concussion. This will be accomplished through data analytics and machine-learning techniques, informed by the results of a large-scale research trial. This strategy will be used to customize the point system to facilitate the user with pacing and planning.Detailed DescriptionAt Parkwood Institute, the Outpatient Acquired Brain Injury Program receives approximately 350 referrals per year related to concussion (an increase of 500% since 2010). This program is renowned for its innovative programming, strong ties to brain injury research across the province, and the way that patients are engaged in program design, development and evaluation. People who experience persistent and disabling problems three months beyond their brain injury are characterized as having ""post-concussion syndrome"". The list of post-concussion symptoms is long. Some of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms include severe headaches and fatigue, forgetfulness, blurred vision and dizziness resulting in balance difficulties, poor concentration, sleep disturbances and depression. These symptoms can impact someone's daily functional ability, cause emotional distress and potentially limit their ability to return to work or school, which includes early back to work employment. Further, the impact of these debilitating symptoms can result in the breakdown of the family unit; whereby the patient's recovery is put at risk along with the mental health and financial impact on their family. While trying to cope with these persistent symptoms, many individuals also experience a lack of post-recovery education and ongoing daily support as to how best to manage their symptoms while they begin to recover. Resting can actually prolong symptoms and lead to more difficulties, while being too active can restart or increase the severity of symptoms. However, health care providers at Parkwood Institute have discovered that patients who learn how to appropriately pace and plan their activities can minimize their symptoms, enhance recovery, and resume activities that had previously been a major part of their lives. In 2013, the Parkwood Institute Outpatient Acquired Brain Injury Team developed a paper-based pacing and planning points system with a scale for rating the difficulty of daily activities (like grocery shopping, driving, and reading) according to the amount of energy each requires, and the severity of symptoms they trigger. By tracking the maximum number of points they can comfortably expend in a day, patients learned how to self-manage their symptoms and improve participation in daily activities. In using this system, patients found they were able to reduce the severity and frequency with which symptoms occurred. A former outpatient said, ""the points plan was such an effective way for me to get through the day without being utterly exhausted. I continue to use it as it has made me more independent, and as such, less reliant on my support people."" In efforts to make this system more user-friendly and readily available for more patients, the investigators have created a mobile version of this planning and pacing points system, ""MyBrainPacer??. Preliminary usability testing has indicated user and clinician satisfaction with the app. For this next stage of development"

Digital therapeutics have demonstrated clinical utility across various domains; however, their development and implementation in the mental health remain constrained within the traditional clinical paradigm. This study conceptualizes and classifies digital interventions for mental health (DIMH), delineates their core technologies, and discusses their strengths and limitations. Current Concepts: DIMH interventions predominantly utilize cognitive behavioral therapy frameworks, targeting conditions such as anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Despite their potential, low user engagement remains a persistent challenge, necessitating personalized approaches tailored to individual needs. Platforms bridge users and therapists, facilitating hybrid online-offline care; however, service delivery may falter due to shortages in provider availability. Emerging social chatbots, while not specifically designed for treatment, show promising outcomes but are limited by insufficient consideration of social contexts and potential interactional errors. Digital phenotyping, which leverages behavioral data such as location tracking and smartphone usage patterns, enhances the personalization of interventions by embedding social context. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) offers effective solutions for exposure therapy and social interaction training, serving as a viable alternative to traditional therapy. Discussion and Conclusion: This review underscores the complementary nature of DIMH technologies and advocates for an integrated approach. The convergence of group-based interventions, chatbots, digital phenotyping, and VR technology presents opportunities for more effective and personalized mental health care. Such advancements could redefine mental health services, addressing unmet needs and fostering innovation."

10.52711/0974-360X.2024.00049,Factors affecting the fear of recurrence in Breast cancer patients,"Kussainova D., Tursynbekova A., Aimbetova G., Bagiyarova F., Kaidarova D.",,2024,1.Jan.24,Article,English,"The fear of cancer recurrence is defined as a mental state of anxiety or concern that cancer may return or spread. It is assumed to be the commonest unpleasant psychological disorder among cancer survivors. Breast cancer is assumed to be one of the commonest cancers in women. Also, the treatment modalities for breast cancer are strongly developed and there is an increase in the cure rate in recent years. However, surviving cancer patients are still feared of recurrence of the neoplasm. The fear of cancer recurrence affected negatively the patients' health and lowered their quality of life. Therefore, we sought to establish effective preventive strategies to improve the psychological health of patients. We searched the literature and reviewed the most recent available data from 2017 to 2023 to clarify the different factors affecting the fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients.We identified different factors that increase the fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients including; anxiety, chemotherapy, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, distress and exhaustion. Also, we identified other factors that decrease the fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients including; younger age patients, having a good quality of time, good social support and good self-efficacy. Regarding preventive measures; our meta-analysis showed that breast cancer patients who underwent Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction had significant improvements on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (P<0.0001), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale (P=0.0002) and perceived stress scale (P=0.0004). Also, we noticed that breast cancer patients who underwent blended cognitive behavior therapy or Smartphone problem-solving therapy had lower fear of cancer recurrence than those who received usual care. Finally, we advocate more research articles applying different modalities to overcome FCR in patients with breast cancer. Also, we recommend the use of different psychological treatments for patients with breast cancer to decrease their fear of cancer recurrence and improve their health."

The incorporation of smartphones and wearable devices in clinical trials provide a unique opportunity to monitor behavior in a non-invasive manner. The objective of this study is to identify the correlations between remotely monitored self-reported assessments and objectively measured activities with depression severity assessments often applied in clinical trials. 30 unipolar depressed patients and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Each participant's daily physiological, physical, and social activity were monitored using a smartphone-based application (CHDR MORE?? for 3 weeks continuously. Self-reported depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) were administered via smartphone weekly and daily respectively. The structured interview guide for the Hamilton depression scale and inventory of depressive symptomatology-clinical rated (SIGHD-IDSC) was administered in-clinic weekly. Nested cross-validated linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the correlation between the CHDR MORE??features with the weekly in-clinic SIGHD-IDSC scores. The SIGHD-IDSC regression model demonstrated an explained variance (R2) of 0.80, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 짹 15 points. The SIGHD-IDSC total scores were positively correlated with the DASS and mean steps-per-minute, and negatively correlated with the travel duration. Unobtrusive, remotely monitored behavior and self-reported outcomes are correlated with depression severity. While these features cannot replace the SIGHD-IDSC for estimating depression severity, it can serve as a complementary approach for assessing depression and drug effects outside the clinic."

Objectives: The present study aimed to reviewing Evidence-based non-drug interventions in the management of the psychological consequences of the prevalence covid 19. Methods: The present systematic review article was conducted by searching and screening related studies on databases of Scopus, Cochrane, Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, in accordance with the PICO scale and PRISMA guidelines during the prevalence covid 19. Results: Of the eight selected papers, two were in children and six in adults. In patients with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19, a significant effect of internet-based integrated intervention was shown to reduce depression and anxiety (P<0.001). Online psychoeducational interventions resulted in a significant difference in increasing resilience (P=0.04) and reducing perceived stress of patients (P=0.01). Jacobson?셲 relaxation technique intervention in COVID-19 patients indicated statistically significant difference in improving quality of sleep and decreases anxiety (P<0.001). The results of respiratory rehabilitation interventions and stretching exercises in COVID-19 patients were associated with improved pulmonary function tests, a significant increase in quality of life scores, and a significant decrease in depression and anxiety scores. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy significantly reduced depression and stress (P<0.001). Conclusion: Psychological intervention can decrease depression and anxiety in healthy and patients of COVID-19 during a disease outbreak. Therefore, different psychological approaches can be effective in reducing anxiety during this stressful period."
10.1002/14651858.CD013766.pub2,Psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis,"Dawson S., Girling C.-J., Cowap L., Clark-Carter D.",,2023,29.Mar.23,Article,English,"Background: Adherence to treatment, including inhaled therapies, is low in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF have been developed, no previous published systematic review has evaluated the evidence for efficacy of these interventions. Objectives: The primary objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The secondary objective was to establish the most effective components, or behaviour change techniques (BCTs), used in these interventions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched databases (PubMed; PsycINFO; EBSCO; Scopus; OpenGrey), trials registries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov), and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, with no restrictions on language, year or publication status. Date of search: 7 August 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF of any age, or comparing psychological interventions with usual care. We included quasi-RCTs if we could reasonably assume that the baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and completed data extraction, risk of bias assessments, and BCT coding (using the BCT Taxonomy v1) for all included trials. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion, or by consultation with a third review author as necessary. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: We included 10 trials (1642 participants) in the review (children and adolescents in four trials; adults in five trials; and children and adults in one trial). Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care; we could combine data from some of these in a number of quantitative analyses. One trial compared a psychological intervention with an active comparator (education plus problem-solving (EPS)). We identified five ongoing trials. Psychological interventions were generally multi-component and complex, containing an average of 9.6 BCTs (range 1 to 28). The two most commonly used BCTs included 'problem-solving' and 'instruction on how to perform the behaviour'. Interventions varied in their type, content and mode of delivery. They included a problem-solving intervention; a paper-based self-management workbook; a telehealth intervention; a group training programme; a digital intervention comprising medication reminders and lung function self-monitoring; a life-coaching intervention; a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention; a brief MI intervention (behaviour change counselling); and a digital intervention combined with behaviour change sessions. Intervention duration ranged from 10 weeks to 12 months. Assessment time points ranged from six to eight weeks up to 23 months. Psychological interventions compared with usual care. We report data here for the 'over six months and up to 12 months' time point. We found that psychological interventions probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies (primary outcome) in people with CF compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 9.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.60 to 10.40; 1 study, 588 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in our second primary outcome, treatment-related adverse events: anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.00; 1 study, 535 participants), or depression (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.60; 1 study, 534 participants), although this was low-certainty evidence. For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) % predicted MD 1.40, 95% CI -0.20 to 3.00; 1 study, 556 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); number of pulmonary exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.11; 1 study, 607 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); or respiratory symptoms (MD 0.70, 95% CI -2.40 to 3.80; 1 study, 534 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, psychological interventions may improve treatment burden (MD 3.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.60; 1 study, 539 participants; low-certainty evidence). The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across these outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness (current evidence included adults only whereas our review question was broader and focused on people of any age) and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Psychological interventions compared with an active comparator. For this comparison the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on one trial (n = 128) comparing an MI intervention to EPS for 12 months. We are uncertain whether an MI intervention, compared with EPS, improves adherence to inhaled therapies, lung function, or quality of life in people with CF, or whether there is an effect on pulmonary exacerbations. The included trial for this comparison did not report on treatment-related adverse events (anxiety and depression). We downgraded all reported outcomes due to small participant numbers, indirectness (trials included only adults), and unclear risk of bias (e.g. selection and attrition bias). Authors' conclusions: Due to the limited quantity of trials included in this review, as well as the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, it was not possible to identify an overall intervention effect using meta-analysis. Some moderate-certainty evidence suggests that psychological interventions (compared with usual care) probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF, without increasing treatment-related adverse events, anxiety and depression (low-certainty evidence). In future review updates (with ongoing trial results included), we hope to be able to establish the most effective BCTs (or 'active ingredients') of interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF. Wherever possible, investigators should make use of the most objective measures of adherence available (e.g. data-logging nebulisers) to accurately determine intervention effects. Outcome reporting needs to be improved to enable combining or separation of measures as appropriate. Likewise, trial reporting needs to include details of intervention content (e.g. BCTs used); duration; intensity; and fidelity. Large trials with a longer follow-up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. Additionally, more research is needed to determine how to support adherence in 'under-served' CF populations."

Filtering of biologically active short wavelength (blue) light by orange tinted eyewear has been shown to induce antimanic and sleep promoting effects in inpatient mania. We here describe a study protocol assessing acute and long-term stabilizing effects of blue blocking (BB) glasses in outpatient treatment of bipolar disorder. Patients and Methods: A total of 150 outpatients with bipolar disorder and current symptoms of (hypo)-mania will be randomized 1:1 to wear glasses with either high (99%) (intervention group) or low (15%) (control group) filtration of short wavelength light (<500 nm). Following a baseline assessment including ratings of manic and depressive symptoms, sleep questionnaires, pupillometric evaluation and 48-h actigraphy, participants will wear the glasses from 6 PM to 8 AM for 7 consecutive days. The primary outcome is the between group difference in change in Young Mania Rating Scale scores after 7 days of intervention (day 9). Following the initial treatment period, the long-term stabilizing effects on mood and sleep will be explored in a 3-month treatment paradigm, where the period of BB treatment is tailored to the current symptomatology using a 14-h antimanic schedule during (hypo-) manic episodes (BB glasses or dark bedroom from 6 PM to 8 AM) and a 2-h maintenance schedule (BB glasses on two hours prior to bedtime/dark bedroom) during euthymic and depressive states. The assessments will be repeated at follow-up visits after 1 and 3 months. Throughout the 3-month study period, participants will perform continuous daily self-monitoring of mood, sleep and activity in a smartphone-based app. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences in actigraphic sleep parameters on day 9 and in day-to-day instability in mood, sleep and activity, general functioning and objective sleep markers (actigraphy) at weeks 5 and 15.
