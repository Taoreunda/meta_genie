Health Canada,"Home-based Non-invasive Brain Stimulation for Treatment-resistant Depression: Feasibility, Efficacy and Biomarker of Treatment Response",,,2023,15.Jun.23,Clinical Trial,used by healthcare professionals worldwide. It has acquired e.g. CE,"Brief SummaryDepression has a yearly prevalence superior to 5%, but a 30% of patients cannot benefit of pharmacological treatment, resulting resistant to it. Transcranial direct current stimulation, due to its reduced invasiveness and easy administration showed to be a useful technique to treat these cases, and it is now broadly used in clinical practice. Moreover, thanks to technological advances, this treatment could be self-administered at home, reducing costs and improving scalability. The aim of this study is to confirm the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a home-based intervention for treatment-resistant depression To do this participants will perform a home-based tDCS intervention consisting of 30 minutes sessions, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Results should provide critical knowledge regarding home-based therapies for the treatment of resistant depression and evidence on brain mechanisms underlying response to non-invasive brain stimulation.Detailed DescriptionMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly disabling pathology with an important prevalence along the whole lifespan. Its global prevalence is around 5% of the population and it has been estimated that depression represents the third cause of worldwide disability causing an enormous social and economic impact. While a significant proportion of patients with MDD show clinical responses to first line pharmacological interventions, almost 30% of cases exhibit resistance to medications, and fail to gain remission of symptoms when administered with antidepressants. This condition, termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defines patients where treatment with two or more products of different pharmacological classes used for a sufficient length of time at an adequate dose, fails to induce a clinically meaningful effect (inadequate response). TRD worsens the personal, social, and economic impact of depression and TRD patients, compared to non-TRD patients, reported reduced quality of life, reduced physical and mental health, presenting important impairments in daily life activities. Furthermore, for these patients, healthcare resources and costs are also significantly higher. To treat these patients in the last decades various alternative therapeutic approaches have been developed. Between them non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) demonstrated to be a safe and effective procedure that successfully reduces and mitigates major depression symptoms. Amongst the different techniques, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one of the more studied and promising approaches, as it can modulate cortical activity related to cognitive control dysfunction in MDD. In tDCS, surface electrodes (anode and cathode) inject low-amplitude direct current through the scalp to modulate brain activity and excitability, with regulatory effects impacting not only the brain areas stimulated but also at the level of brain networks, and therefore with the potentiality of 'optimizing' the balance between integration and segregation of associated functions, commonly observed in neuropsychiatric conditions. In recent years, tDCS showed to be safe and generally well-tolerated when appropriate safety guidelines are followed, and has demonstrated a moderate but consistent effect in depression treatment. Crucially, recent tDCS systems are highly portable and easy to set-up, with the possibility to be configurated remotely, potentially allowing the administration of remotely supervised non-pharmacological treatments at home, facilitating long duration treatments adherence. Recently, scientific interest in the application of home-based tDCS to a variety of clinical conditions has increased progressively, and regarding to depression. This potentially represents a very relevant step forward in the treatment of TRD, making it very scalable and highly feasible for people living far from clinical facilities, with displacement difficulties or considering exceptional situations as the COVID-19 pandemic that on one hand absorbed most healthcare resources and on the other impose to people to eliminate or reduce mobility. Aim: The aim of this study is to confirm the efficacy and feasibility of a home-based intervention for treatment-resistant depression Hypothesis: The specific hypothesis is that it is feasible and effective to implement a self-administered home-based therapeutic intervention to reduce or eliminate depressive symptoms. Material and Methods: Design The investigators will implement an home-based brain stimulation treatment using tDCS in people suffering from TRD. The stimulation will be administered in collaboration with a familiar (companion) that will participate, together with the patients, in a training on tDCS administration before the beginning of the treatment. Moreover, the treatment will be preceded and followed by pre and post assessments. Participants The investigators will enroll 40 participants, over 18 years old. Sample size has been calculated considering the effect size of the few previous studies investigating the modulatory effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on behavioral outcomes of depression (Hedge's g = 0.3-0.76). Sample sizes needed for the type of analysis presented in the ""statistical approach section"" (F statistics as repeated measure ANOVA, logistic and linear regressions, etc..), considering alpha=0.05 and statistical power (1-beta) =0.80, for the interventional study to be conducted is estimated to be of 40 participants, considering a 10-15% drop-out. Companion training Before beginning the intervention the investigators will undertake a first in-person training session, followed by remote training and supervision program, for companions that will administer the stimulation. These training sessions will have the aim to instruct about ,and assure, the correct administration of the stimulation. The program will be based on three main pillars: an in-depth training curriculum about tDCS and instructions on how to administer the stimulation, a set of remote practice sessions hosted by trained research staff for study companions to promptly apply the knowledge and skills derived from the training curriculum, and an on-demand remote assistance infrastructure to provide additional support and guidance to study companions as needed. Pre-Post assessment Before and after the stimulation protocol participants will be administered with questionnaires and scales to evaluate our main outcomes. Efficacy outcomes Participants will be administered with the Montgomery-횇sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the patient participant-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Moreover, participants will also be cognitively assessed with a cognitive screening and regarding their quality of life with the administration of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form. The investigators also administer a cognitive screening using the ""Guttmann Cognitest""digital solution, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for self-administered cognitive testing. Feasibility outcomes To assess feasibility of the treatment the investigators will evaluate the adherence to the intervention in terms of compliance of scheduled sessions measuring the decreasing of electrode impedance and the number of aborted sessions due to high electrodes impedance. tDCS study protocol: general montage and configuration procedures Stimulation will consist of 20 sessions over three consecutive weeks (from Monday to Friday), each session lasting for 30 minutes, following a protocol broadly used in various clinical centers and approved for depression treatment. The stimulation will target the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), consistently previously identified as target for tDCS depression treatment. Current will be supplied in a constantly for 30 minutes and will be initially increased and finally decreased in a 30 s ramp-up and ramp-down fashion. All stimulation parameters adhere to general transcranial electrical stimulation current safety criteria guidelines and for safety issues, the maximum current delivered will be 2 ma. Stimulation will be delivered via ""Sooma tDCS?? medical device"
but will also generate data to inform an existing gap in scientific literature: understanding of concussion recovery patterns. Analysis of the data will facilitate a better understanding of the patterns that exist between symptoms and everyday activity. In turn,Efficacy of the Pacing and Planning App for Persons With Mild Acquired Brain Injury,,,2019,17.May.19,Clinical Trial,the investigators plan to conduct a large-scale evaluation trial to demonstrate the effectiveness of the app more fulsomely. Completing this process will not only provide evidence related to the effectiveness of the app,"Brief SummaryIn efforts to assist people who have had a concussion (mild traumatic brain injury), the Parkwood Pacing and Planning??app has been developed and tested and will be released to the public. The app uses a point system where users have a daily point maximum assigned based on symptom severity with daily activities (recorded by the users). Users can then schedule their daily activities based on their allowed points. The goal is to help users with symptom self-management by facilitating activity planning and pacing. Patients and clinicians have provided positive feedback on the initial version of the app. Using this as a foundation, the investigators envision enhancing the app to provide a more personalized user experience and to enable further discovery and innovations in the recovery from concussion. This will be accomplished through data analytics and machine-learning techniques, informed by the results of a large-scale research trial. This strategy will be used to customize the point system to facilitate the user with pacing and planning.Detailed DescriptionAt Parkwood Institute, the Outpatient Acquired Brain Injury Program receives approximately 350 referrals per year related to concussion (an increase of 500% since 2010). This program is renowned for its innovative programming, strong ties to brain injury research across the province, and the way that patients are engaged in program design, development and evaluation. People who experience persistent and disabling problems three months beyond their brain injury are characterized as having ""post-concussion syndrome"". The list of post-concussion symptoms is long. Some of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms include severe headaches and fatigue, forgetfulness, blurred vision and dizziness resulting in balance difficulties, poor concentration, sleep disturbances and depression. These symptoms can impact someone's daily functional ability, cause emotional distress and potentially limit their ability to return to work or school, which includes early back to work employment. Further, the impact of these debilitating symptoms can result in the breakdown of the family unit; whereby the patient's recovery is put at risk along with the mental health and financial impact on their family. While trying to cope with these persistent symptoms, many individuals also experience a lack of post-recovery education and ongoing daily support as to how best to manage their symptoms while they begin to recover. Resting can actually prolong symptoms and lead to more difficulties, while being too active can restart or increase the severity of symptoms. However, health care providers at Parkwood Institute have discovered that patients who learn how to appropriately pace and plan their activities can minimize their symptoms, enhance recovery, and resume activities that had previously been a major part of their lives. In 2013, the Parkwood Institute Outpatient Acquired Brain Injury Team developed a paper-based pacing and planning points system with a scale for rating the difficulty of daily activities (like grocery shopping, driving, and reading) according to the amount of energy each requires, and the severity of symptoms they trigger. By tracking the maximum number of points they can comfortably expend in a day, patients learned how to self-manage their symptoms and improve participation in daily activities. In using this system, patients found they were able to reduce the severity and frequency with which symptoms occurred. A former outpatient said, ""the points plan was such an effective way for me to get through the day without being utterly exhausted. I continue to use it as it has made me more independent, and as such, less reliant on my support people."" In efforts to make this system more user-friendly and readily available for more patients, the investigators have created a mobile version of this planning and pacing points system, ""MyBrainPacer??. Preliminary usability testing has indicated user and clinician satisfaction with the app. For this next stage of development"

Digital therapeutics have demonstrated clinical utility across various domains; however, their development and implementation in the mental health remain constrained within the traditional clinical paradigm. This study conceptualizes and classifies digital interventions for mental health (DIMH), delineates their core technologies, and discusses their strengths and limitations. Current Concepts: DIMH interventions predominantly utilize cognitive behavioral therapy frameworks, targeting conditions such as anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Despite their potential, low user engagement remains a persistent challenge, necessitating personalized approaches tailored to individual needs. Platforms bridge users and therapists, facilitating hybrid online-offline care; however, service delivery may falter due to shortages in provider availability. Emerging social chatbots, while not specifically designed for treatment, show promising outcomes but are limited by insufficient consideration of social contexts and potential interactional errors. Digital phenotyping, which leverages behavioral data such as location tracking and smartphone usage patterns, enhances the personalization of interventions by embedding social context. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) offers effective solutions for exposure therapy and social interaction training, serving as a viable alternative to traditional therapy. Discussion and Conclusion: This review underscores the complementary nature of DIMH technologies and advocates for an integrated approach. The convergence of group-based interventions, chatbots, digital phenotyping, and VR technology presents opportunities for more effective and personalized mental health care. Such advancements could redefine mental health services, addressing unmet needs and fostering innovation."

10.52711/0974-360X.2024.00049,Factors affecting the fear of recurrence in Breast cancer patients,"Kussainova D., Tursynbekova A., Aimbetova G., Bagiyarova F., Kaidarova D.",,2024,1.Jan.24,Article,English,"The fear of cancer recurrence is defined as a mental state of anxiety or concern that cancer may return or spread. It is assumed to be the commonest unpleasant psychological disorder among cancer survivors. Breast cancer is assumed to be one of the commonest cancers in women. Also, the treatment modalities for breast cancer are strongly developed and there is an increase in the cure rate in recent years. However, surviving cancer patients are still feared of recurrence of the neoplasm. The fear of cancer recurrence affected negatively the patients' health and lowered their quality of life. Therefore, we sought to establish effective preventive strategies to improve the psychological health of patients. We searched the literature and reviewed the most recent available data from 2017 to 2023 to clarify the different factors affecting the fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients.We identified different factors that increase the fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients including; anxiety, chemotherapy, avoidance, intrusive thoughts, distress and exhaustion. Also, we identified other factors that decrease the fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients including; younger age patients, having a good quality of time, good social support and good self-efficacy. Regarding preventive measures; our meta-analysis showed that breast cancer patients who underwent Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction had significant improvements on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (P<0.0001), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale (P=0.0002) and perceived stress scale (P=0.0004). Also, we noticed that breast cancer patients who underwent blended cognitive behavior therapy or Smartphone problem-solving therapy had lower fear of cancer recurrence than those who received usual care. Finally, we advocate more research articles applying different modalities to overcome FCR in patients with breast cancer. Also, we recommend the use of different psychological treatments for patients with breast cancer to decrease their fear of cancer recurrence and improve their health."

The incorporation of smartphones and wearable devices in clinical trials provide a unique opportunity to monitor behavior in a non-invasive manner. The objective of this study is to identify the correlations between remotely monitored self-reported assessments and objectively measured activities with depression severity assessments often applied in clinical trials. 30 unipolar depressed patients and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Each participant's daily physiological, physical, and social activity were monitored using a smartphone-based application (CHDR MORE?? for 3 weeks continuously. Self-reported depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) were administered via smartphone weekly and daily respectively. The structured interview guide for the Hamilton depression scale and inventory of depressive symptomatology-clinical rated (SIGHD-IDSC) was administered in-clinic weekly. Nested cross-validated linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the correlation between the CHDR MORE??features with the weekly in-clinic SIGHD-IDSC scores. The SIGHD-IDSC regression model demonstrated an explained variance (R2) of 0.80, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 짹 15 points. The SIGHD-IDSC total scores were positively correlated with the DASS and mean steps-per-minute, and negatively correlated with the travel duration. Unobtrusive, remotely monitored behavior and self-reported outcomes are correlated with depression severity. While these features cannot replace the SIGHD-IDSC for estimating depression severity, it can serve as a complementary approach for assessing depression and drug effects outside the clinic."

Objectives: The present study aimed to reviewing Evidence-based non-drug interventions in the management of the psychological consequences of the prevalence covid 19. Methods: The present systematic review article was conducted by searching and screening related studies on databases of Scopus, Cochrane, Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, in accordance with the PICO scale and PRISMA guidelines during the prevalence covid 19. Results: Of the eight selected papers, two were in children and six in adults. In patients with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19, a significant effect of internet-based integrated intervention was shown to reduce depression and anxiety (P<0.001). Online psychoeducational interventions resulted in a significant difference in increasing resilience (P=0.04) and reducing perceived stress of patients (P=0.01). Jacobson?셲 relaxation technique intervention in COVID-19 patients indicated statistically significant difference in improving quality of sleep and decreases anxiety (P<0.001). The results of respiratory rehabilitation interventions and stretching exercises in COVID-19 patients were associated with improved pulmonary function tests, a significant increase in quality of life scores, and a significant decrease in depression and anxiety scores. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy significantly reduced depression and stress (P<0.001). Conclusion: Psychological intervention can decrease depression and anxiety in healthy and patients of COVID-19 during a disease outbreak. Therefore, different psychological approaches can be effective in reducing anxiety during this stressful period."
10.1002/14651858.CD013766.pub2,Psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis,"Dawson S., Girling C.-J., Cowap L., Clark-Carter D.",,2023,29.Mar.23,Article,English,"Background: Adherence to treatment, including inhaled therapies, is low in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF have been developed, no previous published systematic review has evaluated the evidence for efficacy of these interventions. Objectives: The primary objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The secondary objective was to establish the most effective components, or behaviour change techniques (BCTs), used in these interventions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched databases (PubMed; PsycINFO; EBSCO; Scopus; OpenGrey), trials registries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov), and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, with no restrictions on language, year or publication status. Date of search: 7 August 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF of any age, or comparing psychological interventions with usual care. We included quasi-RCTs if we could reasonably assume that the baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and completed data extraction, risk of bias assessments, and BCT coding (using the BCT Taxonomy v1) for all included trials. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion, or by consultation with a third review author as necessary. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: We included 10 trials (1642 participants) in the review (children and adolescents in four trials; adults in five trials; and children and adults in one trial). Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care; we could combine data from some of these in a number of quantitative analyses. One trial compared a psychological intervention with an active comparator (education plus problem-solving (EPS)). We identified five ongoing trials. Psychological interventions were generally multi-component and complex, containing an average of 9.6 BCTs (range 1 to 28). The two most commonly used BCTs included 'problem-solving' and 'instruction on how to perform the behaviour'. Interventions varied in their type, content and mode of delivery. They included a problem-solving intervention; a paper-based self-management workbook; a telehealth intervention; a group training programme; a digital intervention comprising medication reminders and lung function self-monitoring; a life-coaching intervention; a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention; a brief MI intervention (behaviour change counselling); and a digital intervention combined with behaviour change sessions. Intervention duration ranged from 10 weeks to 12 months. Assessment time points ranged from six to eight weeks up to 23 months. Psychological interventions compared with usual care. We report data here for the 'over six months and up to 12 months' time point. We found that psychological interventions probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies (primary outcome) in people with CF compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 9.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.60 to 10.40; 1 study, 588 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in our second primary outcome, treatment-related adverse events: anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.00; 1 study, 535 participants), or depression (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.60; 1 study, 534 participants), although this was low-certainty evidence. For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) % predicted MD 1.40, 95% CI -0.20 to 3.00; 1 study, 556 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); number of pulmonary exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.11; 1 study, 607 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); or respiratory symptoms (MD 0.70, 95% CI -2.40 to 3.80; 1 study, 534 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, psychological interventions may improve treatment burden (MD 3.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.60; 1 study, 539 participants; low-certainty evidence). The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across these outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness (current evidence included adults only whereas our review question was broader and focused on people of any age) and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Psychological interventions compared with an active comparator. For this comparison the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on one trial (n = 128) comparing an MI intervention to EPS for 12 months. We are uncertain whether an MI intervention, compared with EPS, improves adherence to inhaled therapies, lung function, or quality of life in people with CF, or whether there is an effect on pulmonary exacerbations. The included trial for this comparison did not report on treatment-related adverse events (anxiety and depression). We downgraded all reported outcomes due to small participant numbers, indirectness (trials included only adults), and unclear risk of bias (e.g. selection and attrition bias). Authors' conclusions: Due to the limited quantity of trials included in this review, as well as the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, it was not possible to identify an overall intervention effect using meta-analysis. Some moderate-certainty evidence suggests that psychological interventions (compared with usual care) probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF, without increasing treatment-related adverse events, anxiety and depression (low-certainty evidence). In future review updates (with ongoing trial results included), we hope to be able to establish the most effective BCTs (or 'active ingredients') of interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF. Wherever possible, investigators should make use of the most objective measures of adherence available (e.g. data-logging nebulisers) to accurately determine intervention effects. Outcome reporting needs to be improved to enable combining or separation of measures as appropriate. Likewise, trial reporting needs to include details of intervention content (e.g. BCTs used); duration; intensity; and fidelity. Large trials with a longer follow-up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. Additionally, more research is needed to determine how to support adherence in 'under-served' CF populations."

Filtering of biologically active short wavelength (blue) light by orange tinted eyewear has been shown to induce antimanic and sleep promoting effects in inpatient mania. We here describe a study protocol assessing acute and long-term stabilizing effects of blue blocking (BB) glasses in outpatient treatment of bipolar disorder. Patients and Methods: A total of 150 outpatients with bipolar disorder and current symptoms of (hypo)-mania will be randomized 1:1 to wear glasses with either high (99%) (intervention group) or low (15%) (control group) filtration of short wavelength light (<500 nm). Following a baseline assessment including ratings of manic and depressive symptoms, sleep questionnaires, pupillometric evaluation and 48-h actigraphy, participants will wear the glasses from 6 PM to 8 AM for 7 consecutive days. The primary outcome is the between group difference in change in Young Mania Rating Scale scores after 7 days of intervention (day 9). Following the initial treatment period, the long-term stabilizing effects on mood and sleep will be explored in a 3-month treatment paradigm, where the period of BB treatment is tailored to the current symptomatology using a 14-h antimanic schedule during (hypo-) manic episodes (BB glasses or dark bedroom from 6 PM to 8 AM) and a 2-h maintenance schedule (BB glasses on two hours prior to bedtime/dark bedroom) during euthymic and depressive states. The assessments will be repeated at follow-up visits after 1 and 3 months. Throughout the 3-month study period, participants will perform continuous daily self-monitoring of mood, sleep and activity in a smartphone-based app. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences in actigraphic sleep parameters on day 9 and in day-to-day instability in mood, sleep and activity, general functioning and objective sleep markers (actigraphy) at weeks 5 and 15.

However, few studies have utilized ILMs to predict outcomes for at-risk, non-clinical populations in real-world settings. Methods: Medical interns (N = 2881; 57 % female; 58 % White) were recruited from over 300 US residency programs. Interns completed a pre-internship assessment of depression, were given Fitbit wearable devices, and provided daily mood ratings (scale: 1??0) via mobile application during the study period. Three-step hierarchical logistic regressions were used to predict depression and SI at the end of the first quarter utilizing pre-internship predictors in step 1, Fitbit sleep/step features in step 2, and daily diary mood features in step 3. Results: Passively collected Fitbit features related to sleep and steps had negligible predictive validity for depression, and no incremental predictive validity for SI. However, mean-level and variability in mood scores derived from daily diaries were significant independent predictors of depression and SI, and significantly improved model accuracy. Limitations: Work schedules for interns may result in sleep and activity patterns that differ from typical associations with depression or SI. The SI measure did not capture intent or severity. Conclusions: Mobile self-reporting of daily mood improved the prediction of depression and SI during a meaningful at-risk period under naturalistic conditions. Additional research is needed to guide the development of adaptive interventions among vulnerable populations."
10.23736/S2724-6612.22.02322-3,Framework for behavioral disorder detection using machine learning and application of virtual cognitive behavioral therapy in COVID-19 pandemic,"Niger T., Rayhan H., Islam R., Noor K.A., Hasan K.",,2022,1.Sep.22,Article,English,"In this modern world, people are becoming more self-centered and unsocial. On the other hand, people are stressed, becoming more anxious during COVID-19 pandemic situation and exhibiting symptoms of behavioral disorder. To measure the symptoms of behavioral disorder, usually psychiatrist use long hour sessions and inputs from specific questionnaire. This process is time consuming and sometime is ineffective to detect the right behavioral disorder. Also, reserved people sometime hesitate to follow this process. We have created a digital framework which can detect behavioral disorder and prescribe virtual cognitive behavioral therapy (vCBT) for recovery. By using this framework people can input required data that are highly responsible for the three behavioral disorders namely depression, anxiety and internet addiction. We have applied machine learning technique to detect specific behavioral disorder from samples. This system guides the user with basic understanding and treatment through vCBT from anywhere any time which would potentially be the steppingstone for the user to be conscious and pursue right treatment."

The results demonstrated that the parasympathetic nerve activity was significantly increased and that the heart rate was significantly decreased during the exposure compared with that during the resting state. As for mood, five of the six Profile of Mood States (POMS) scales (?쏷ension?밃nxiety,???쏡epression,???쏛nger?밐ostility,???쏤atigue,??and ?쏞on-fusion?? were significantly decreased after the experience. In addition, psychological restorative effects were also confirmed, with a significant decrease in ?쐍egative affect??(measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)) and a significant increase in the sense of restorative-ness (Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS)) after the experience. In contrast, comparing the digital Shin-rin-yoku environment with the actual forest environment and the urban environment using POMS, PANAS, ROS, and Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS), the psychological effects and environmental traits of the digital Shinrin-yoku were found to be considerably similar to those of the actual forest environment."

Due to individual courses, post stroke management appears rather challenging and is hindered by existing barriers between treatment sectors. As a novel concept, the PostStroke-Manager combines digital and sensor-based technology with personal assistance to enable intersectoral cooperation, best possible reduction of stroke-related disability, optimal secondary prevention, and detection of physical and psychological comorbidities. Methods: This prospective single-center observational study aims to investigate the feasibility of the PostStroke-Manager concept in an outpatient setting. Ninety patients who have suffered an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack will be equipped with a tablet and mobile devices recording physical activity, blood pressure, and electrocardiographic signals. Through a server-based platform, patients will be connected with the primary care physician, a stroke pilot and, if necessary, other specialists who will use web-based platforms. Via the tablet, patients will have access to an application with 10 newly designed components including, for instance, a communication tool, medication schedule, medical records platform, and psychometric screenings (e.g., depression, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, adherence, cognitive impairment). During the 1-year follow-up period, clinical visits are scheduled at three-month intervals. In the interim, communication will be secured by an appropriate tool that includes text messenger, audio, and video telephony. As the primary endpoint, feasibility will be measured by a 14-item questionnaire that addresses digital components, technical support, and personal assistance. The PostStroke-Manager will be judged feasible if at least 50% of these aspects are rated positively by at least 75% of patients. Secondary endpoints include feedback from professionals and longitudinal analyses on clinical and psychometric parameters. Perspective: This study will answer the question of whether combined digital and personal support is a feasible approach to post stroke management. Furthermore, the patient perspective gained regarding digital support may help to specify future applications. This study will also provide information regarding the potential use of remote therapies and mobile devices in situations with limited face-to-face contacts.

Recommending healthy activities is a core principle in Behavioral Activation (BA), which is typically done by the therapist. However, most BA smartphone applications do not recommend specific activities. This article reports quantitative results from an 8-week feasibility study of a previously presented smartphone-based BA recommender system. The system supports the planning and enacting of pleasurable activities and promotes activation of diverse activity types. Enrollment included 43 clinically depressed patients who installed the system on their phone and initiated activity scheduling. Twenty-nine patients used the system daily for more than a week.These patients presented a significant reduction in depressive symptoms during the study period. They displayed a more personalized usage approach and created recurring health goals comprising of their own customized activities. Furthermore, they took inspiration within various types of activities, thereby displaying more activity diversity. This study suggests that enacting a diverse mixture of activities that promote good sleep, personal hygiene, exercise, social contact, and leisure time can be essential in managing depressive symptoms. A smartphone-based activity recommender system can help patients achieve this."

Key stakeholder involvement in informing development and implementation of such programs is vital. However, little research demonstrates key stakeholder insights to inform the design and delivery of PA programs for improving PND. The aim of this study was to explore key stakeholder perspectives on the design and delivery of a home-based PA program for mothers with PND symptoms to inform future real-world implementation and scale-up. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study was undertaken whereby semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from various key stakeholder organisations involved in postnatal PA and/or mental health, public health and policy in Australia (n = 11). Interviews were conducted between September to November 2019 and explored stakeholder perceptions on the design and delivery of a home-based PA program for mothers with PND symptoms. The interview schedule was informed by both the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the PRACTical planning for Implementation and Scale-up (PRACTIS) guide. Data were analysed thematically using both deductive and inductive coding. RESULTS: The relative priority of PND and PA was high for most organisations involved, although none implemented PA programs supporting women at risk of PND. Most stakeholders perceived the program as appealing due to addressing barriers to postnatal PA, although identified some feasibility issues regarding funding and delivery mechanisms. Suggestions for program adaptations included an equity focus (e.g. providing socioeconomically disadvantaged women with a greater program dose; translating web-app based content into various languages). Planned components of the program were suggested to align (i.e. relative advantage) with existing initiatives (e.g. equipment hire for nurseries scheme) and screening systems for PND (timing of referral). Perceived barriers to scale-up included logistics/cost of equipment, organisational capacity demands and safety risks/liability. Perceived enablers to scale-up included linking the program with 'adjunct' programs and services. CONCLUSIONS: While the program was appealing and most organisations could see a role in endorsing and/or referring to the program, funding and delivery mechanisms still need to be identified."

These figures underline the widespread concerns in our society regarding the potential dangers and risks associated with Internet and digital media use. Methods: Selective literature search for records on Internet-related disorders in children and adolescents. Results: Internet-related disorders are now viewed as belonging to the behavioral addiction. Research has revealed similarities to substance-related disorders. There are often associations with other mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders, as well as disturbed sleep patterns, increased risk taking, nicotine abuse, an unbalanced diet, and lack of exercise. Female adolescents are statistically significantly more often affected than male adolescents (7.1% versus 4.5%). The German STICA study, the first randomized controlled trial worldwide, demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy was effective compared with a waiting group (odds ratio 10.10, 95% confidence interval [3.69; 27.65]). Conclusion: Internet-related disorders have not yet been conclusively conceptualized and operationalized. Further work is urgently required to refine the concepts of both the illness and and its treatment."

Objective: To understand how the residency experience affects sleep, physical activity, and mood, and to understand the directional relationships among these variables. Design: A prospective longitudinal study. Subjects: Thirty-three first-year residents (interns) provided data from 2 months pre-internship through the first 6 months of internship. Main Measures: Objective real-time assessment of daily sleep and physical activity was assessed through accelerometry-based wearable devices. Mood scaled from 1 to 10 was recorded daily using SMS technology. Average compliance rates prior to internship for mood, sleep, and physical activity were 77.4, 80.2, and 93.7%, and were 78.8, 53.0, and 79.9% during internship. Key Results: After beginning residency, interns lost an average of 2 h and 48 min of sleep per week (t = ??3.04, p <.01). Mood and physical activity decreased by 7.5% (t = ??3.67, p <.01) and 11.5% (t = ??3.15, p <.01), respectively. A bidirectional relationship emerged between sleep and mood during internship wherein short sleep augured worse mood the next day (b =.12, p <.001), which, in turn, presaged shorter sleep the next night (b =.06, p =.03). Importantly, the effect of short sleep on mood was twice as large as mood?셲 effect on sleep. Lastly, substantial shifts in sleep timing during internship (sleeping ??3 h earlier or later than pre-internship patterns) led to shorter sleep (earlier: b = ??36, p <.01; later: b = ??1.75, p <.001) and poorer mood (earlier: b = ??41, p <.001; later: b = ??41, p <.001). Conclusions: Shift work, short sleep, and physical inactivity confer a challenging environment for physician mental health. Efforts to increase sleep opportunity through designing shift schedules to allow for adequate opportunity to resynchronize the circadian system and improving exercise compatibility of the work environment may improve mood in this depression-vulnerable population."

Given the demonstrated benefits of exercise for decreasing depression, negative affect, and urges to drink, helping women engage in a lifestyle physical activity (LPA) intervention in early recovery may provide them a tool they can utilize ?쐇n the moment??in order to cope with negative emotional states and alcohol craving when relapse risk is highest. New digital fitness technologies (e.g., Fitbit activity monitor with web and mobile applications) may facilitate increases in physical activity (PA) through goal setting and self-monitoring. Method We piloted a 12-week LPA + Fitbit intervention focused on strategically using bouts of PA to cope with affect and alcohol cravings to prevent relapse in 20 depressed women (mean age = 39.5 years) in alcohol treatment. Results Participants wore their Fitbit on 73% of days during the intervention period. An average of 9174 steps/day were taken on the days the Fitbit was worn. Participants completed 4.7 of the 6 scheduled phone PA counseling sessions (78%). Among women who completed the intervention (n = 15), 44% remained abstinent throughout the entire course of treatment. On average, women were abstinent on 95% of days during the 12-week intervention. Participants reported an increase in using PA to cope with either negative affect or urges to drink from baseline to end of treatment (p < 0.05). Further, participants reported high satisfaction with the LPA + Fitbit intervention and with the Fitbit tracker. Conclusions Further research is needed to evaluate the LPA + Fitbit intervention in a more rigorous randomized controlled trial. If the LPA + Fitbit intervention proves to be helpful during early recovery, this simple, low-cost and easily transported intervention can provide a much-needed alternate coping strategy to help reduce relapse risk among women in alcohol treatment."

The present study aimed at investigating (1) voice features collected during phone calls as objective markers of affective states in bipolar disorder and (2) if combining voice features with automatically generated objective smartphone data on behavioral activities (for example, number of text messages and phone calls per day) and electronic self-monitored data (mood) on illness activity would increase the accuracy as a marker of affective states. Using smartphones, voice features, automatically generated objective smartphone data on behavioral activities and electronic self-monitored data were collected from 28 outpatients with bipolar disorder in naturalistic settings on a daily basis during a period of 12 weeks. Depressive and manic symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item and the Young Mania Rating Scale, respectively, by a researcher blinded to smartphone data. Data were analyzed using random forest algorithms. Affective states were classified using voice features extracted during everyday life phone calls. Voice features were found to be more accurate, sensitive and specific in the classification of manic or mixed states with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89 compared with an AUC = 0.78 for the classification of depressive states. Combining voice features with automatically generated objective smartphone data on behavioral activities and electronic self-monitored data increased the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of classification of affective states slightly. Voice features collected in naturalistic settings using smartphones may be used as objective state markers in patients with bipolar disorder."

However, we still have limited knowledge of how patients experience this treatment format. The objective of this study was to explore participants' views of a smartphone-based behavioral activation treatment. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 strategically (participants with different overall experiences) selected participants, suffering from major depression according to the DSM-IV. The interview data were processed with the aid of thematic analysis. The analysis generated the three main themes: Commitment, Treatment and Lack of important components, with attached subthemes. In conclusion, the findings from the current study correspond with existing knowledge in the field of internet-based treatment. Considering that this kind of treatment is still quite new, the need for further research and development is considerable. Nevertheless, its availability, assimilation into users' everyday lives and possible motivational qualities speak of its potential."

In rats, postnatal manipulation studies have focused on behavioural and endocrine anxiety effects, and have demonstrated that mild pup stimulation in the form of early handling (EH) is chronically anxiolytic relative to no stimulation in the form of non-handling (NH). Furthermore, apparently severe manipulations in the form of 3-4 h daily litter-dam separation (maternal separation) or pup-litter-dam separation (early deprivation, ED) are either without effect or even EH-like, relative to NH. In this Wistar rat study, we investigated the effects of ED under different circadian and thermal conditions on adulthood behavioural and endocrine responsiveness to environmental challenge, relative to NH. ED was performed on days 1-14, during either the Light or Dark phase and at either 21째C (cold) or 32째C (warm). Dark-cold ED adults exhibited reduced motivation to obtain sucrose in a progressive ratio schedule, tended to be less mobile in a forced swim test, but did not exhibit an escape deficit in a foot-shock pre-exposure/shuttle box test, or altered basal or stress endocrine activity. Light ED was completely without effect on adult phenotype. Even relative to stringent NH comparison, dark-cold ED leads to a long-term trait of mild gustatory anhedonia in Wistar rats. 짤 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

These effects are particularly pronounced among young individuals, with university students being especially susceptible to the negative influences of smartphone use. METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 781 Brazilian university students. We assessed socio-economic variables, smartphone addiction, depression, anxiety, stress outcomes, eating behavior, body image satisfaction, and self-reported physical activity. MANOVA and Chi-square tests were performed to compare continuous and categorical variables between genders. K-means clustering was used to identify participant profiles based on various self-reported variables, with differences between clusters validated using the Z-test and the silhouette coefficient. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified. Cluster 1 featured participants with a significant disparity between their perceived and desired body image, higher scores on eating disorders, smartphone addiction, and mental health questionnaires, and lower engagement in physical exercise. Cluster 2 consisted of older participants who scored lower on smartphone addiction and mental health with a higher body mass index. Cluster 3 included younger participants with a smaller silhouette scale disparity, lower eating disorder scores, and lower body mass index. Smartphone addiction showed significant associations with eating disorders in overall eating disorders classification (X짼=13.4; p<0.001), bulimic behavior (X짼=20.0; p<0.001), and social pressure to eat (X짼=4.3; p<0.001).

This paper describes the lessons learned while implementing an internet-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) for reducing depression symptom burden in older acutely-bereaved adults. Methods: The RCT was entitled ?쏻idowed Elders' Lifestyle after Loss??(or WELL), which compared the efficacy of a DHI to an enhanced usual care (EUC) for reducing depression symptoms in adults 60+ years who lost their spouse/life partner within the previous 12 months. Participants randomized to the DHI used their own tablet, smartphone, or pc to record the timing and regularity of sleep, meals, and physical activity twice daily, for 12 weeks. The also received weekly health coaching sessions from a clinician certified in motivational interviewing. Participants randomized to the EUC arm received weekly calls from research staff and were assessed on the same schedule as intervention participants. All study procedures were conducted virtually. Methodological and procedural challenges were discussed weekly with study staff and the primary investigator. Results: Many challenges can be categorized as follows recruiting virtually, obtaining informed consent, training older adults to use technology, and establishing rapport with older adults. Solutions required researcher and interventionist flexibility in adapting to new strategies. For instance, we redesigned the informed consent process to include a user-friendly brochure that enhanced participants' understanding of the RCT and improved our enrollment rate. We also utilized user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Conclusion: We resolved implementation challenges without compromising internal validity via interdisciplinary collaborations with mobile programmers to ensure our technology met the unique and varied needs of aging users. The solutions from this study may promote the recruitment and retainment of older adults in research studies that use technology-based interventions."

This study examines the efficacy of individually tailored ICBT intervention with on-demand support for reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in young adults.Methods: This two-arm randomized controlled trial involved Brazilian young adults (aged 18-24 years) who were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (n = 46) or a waitlist control group (n = 46). The 8-week treatment included individually tailored ICBT with therapist support on-demand via chat, conducted on an online platform. Primary outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression. Secondary measures included stress, insomnia, smartphone and social media use, perfectionism, and quality of life. A six-month follow-up was conducted.Results: Multiple regression analysis indicated that the treatment group, in comparison to the control group, showed significant reductions in anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia, as well as improvements in quality of life, with moderate to large effects sizes.Conclusion: ICBT is a viable intervention for young Brazilians experiencing common mental health symptoms. Further research is needed to explore implementation and impact on other populations."

This review aims to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and computational methods are advancing the understanding and treatment of depression, focusing on neurobiological mechanisms, early detection, and behavioral activation (BA) interventions. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted searching PubMed, Scopus, ACM, and Web of Science databases. From 77654 articles identified, 48 studies were selected based on relevance and methodological rigor. These include meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, or observational studies, focusing on the integration of AI and computational tools in depression research and treatment. Results: Advances in AI-driven neuroimaging and machine learning have enhanced the identification of neurobiological changes associated with depression, such as hippocampal atrophy, prefrontal cortex dysfunction, and HPA axis dysregulation. AI models have also facilitated early detection of subtle biomarkers linked to neuroinflammation and reduced BDNF levels. Furthermore, AI-powered digital platforms have optimized BA interventions, personalized treatment and improving access through virtual coaching and mobile applications. AI-enhanced interventions incorporating physical activity monitoring have shown neuroprotective effects, promoting neurogenesis, reducing inflammation, and increasing BDNF levels. Conclusion: The integration of AI and computational approaches into traditional depression therapies holds significant promise. AI-driven tools, when combined with BA interventions, provide scalable, personalized solutions, particularly for individuals with limited access to conventional treatments. The future of depression care can strongly profit from the convergence of AI, neurobiology, and behavioral science, which will enhance diagnostic accuracy, treatment effectiveness, and accessibility."

Although effective, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered by trained professionals is not easily accessible. Objective: This randomized trial evaluated the effects of a CBT-based mobile application designed to reduce vulnerability to EDs by targeting associated maladaptive beliefs. Method: A non-clinical sample of adolescents (n = 93; Mage = 13.9; 56 girls) was randomized to use a mobile application targeting maladaptive beliefs related to EDs for approximately 5 min a day during a 2-week period. The active control group used the same app, for the same period of time but with neutral content. Maladaptive belief related to EDs, ED symptoms, body satisfaction and self-esteem were measured at baseline (T1), immediately after two weeks of mobile application use (T2), and at 1-month follow-up (T3). Results: Our results indicated that relative to those in the control condition, adolescents that used the application demonstrated a decrease in some ED-related maladaptive beliefs and symptoms. These effects were small-to-medium size and were maintained at 1-month. No significant effects were found regarding depression, body satisfaction or self-esteem. Conclusion: These results underscore the potential usefulness of brief, low-intensity, mobile interventions in reducing vulnerability to EDs in the adolescent population."

While increasing patient numbers inevitably lead to a greater need for treatment, resources to adequately match this demand are limited. Digital technologies hold promises to complement standard therapeutic approaches such as psychotherapy, thereby alleviating the strain on an increasingly burdened healthcare system. This study aimed at testing a new comprehensive smartwatch-based digital intervention program administered for 12 weeks in depressed patients to aid therapeutic progression and symptom relief. Methods: Seventeen mildly to moderately depressed patients receiving the smartwatch-based intervention were compared to an existing, retrospective control group (35 patients). The intervention program comprised behavioral activation, cognitive-behavioral intervention for insomnia and physical activity interventions. Intervention effects on the reduction of depression severity, measured by the PHQ-9, were investigated using a repeated measure analysis of variance (rmANOVA). Results: The rmANOVA showed a significant group x time interaction for the PHQ-9 scores, F(1, 50) = 7.21, p = 0.010, with post-hoc t-tests revealing group differences after but not before the intervention. Conclusion: This study suggests that smartwatch-based interventions are feasible and effective in reducing mild to moderate depressive symptoms and could therefore be a promising stand-alone or complementary intervention to psychotherapy. Further research with a randomized controlled trial is required to validate these results."

Self-help practices have emerged as cost-effective and scalable strategies for managing mild to moderate depression, empowering individuals to take an active role in their mental health care. Theory-based interventions, which are grounded in established psychological frameworks, provide a systematic approach to designing, implementing and evaluating these self-help practices. However, despite the growing availability of self-help interventions, their effectiveness varies, and many lack a solid theoretical foundation. Summarized evidence of the effects of theory-based interventions remains limited. Objectives This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of theory-based interventions incorporating self-help practices in reducing depressive symptoms severity among adults with mild to moderate depression. Methods The review will follow PRISMA guidelines and has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Randomised trials evaluating theory-based interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs), delivered via digital platforms will be included. Studies will be identified through searches of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Cochrane bibliographic databases. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be conducted independently by two reviewers, focusing on study characteristics, intervention details and critical outcomes (reduction in depressive symptom severity and adverse effects). Results The review will synthesize evidence on the effects and adaptability of theory-based interventions, highlighting the specific contributions of theoretical frameworks to intervention outcomes. Findings will be presented in tabular and narrative formats, identifying gaps and implications for clinical practice and future research. Conclusion This systematic review will provide actionable insights into the design and implementation of theory-based interventions for managing mild to moderate depression. The findings aim to inform evidence-based guidelines for primary care integration, promoting accessible, scalable and effective mental health solutions globally."

Design: An online three-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial. Ethical approval was provided by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee. Methods: Adolescents in Australia aged 12 to 17 years with mild to moderate depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Adolescent version (PHQ-A) who were not receiving treatment or experiencing recent or severe suicidality, had access to a smartphone, and parental consent were randomly allocated to receive (i) self-directed use of ClearlyMe(짰), (ii) ClearlyMe(짰) with SMS-guided support, or the active control (SMS-delivered psychoeducation content) for six weeks. Participants were not directly informed of their allocation and the statistician was blinded for analysis. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post intervention (primary endpoint: 6-weeks post baseline) and follow-up (secondary endpoint: 4-months post baseline). Primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post intervention as measured by the PHQ-A. Intention-to-treat analyses used multilevel linear modelling. Results: 569 adolescents (Mean age: 15.89, SD: 1.26, 74.2% female) were included in the analyses. The declines in depressive symptoms post intervention in the self-directed (d=0.35, 95%CI:-0.57 ??-0.12) and guided conditions (d=0.33, 95%CI: -.0.55 ??-0.10) were significantly greater than the control. The effects of self-directed and guided were comparable. There were no differences between the conditions at follow-up for any outcomes. Secondary outcomes followed a similar pattern of change at both endpoints, although there were no differential effects for anxiety symptoms. The risk of adverse events was almost double in the control when compared to the self-directed (IRR: 1.73, 95%CI: 1.15 ??2.62, P=.009) and guided conditions (IRR: 1.98 (95%CI: 1.27 ??3.08, P=.002). Conclusions: ClearlyMe(짰), when delivered with or without SMS-guided support, was efficacious for short term reductions in depressive symptoms in adolescents when compared to SMS-delivered psychoeducation."

Digital mental health interventions offer scalable solutions, but many struggle to achieve acceptable patient engagement. Tailoring and personalizing materials to individual needs is paramount for driving engagement, a task that generative artificial intelligence AI (genAI) is potentially able to achieve. To examine this promise, we conducted a randomized controlled trial using a genAI-enabled therapy app, Limbic Care, which delivers personalized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) materials, against PDF workbooks delivering static CBT content, as commonly used in standard care. Adults with elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression (N = 540) were randomly assigned to the app or control group for six weeks. The app group exhibited a threefold increase in engagement (2.4 times higher usage frequency, 3.8 times longer usage durations). While both groups showed similar overall symptom improvement, participants who engaged with the app's clinical personalization capabilities experienced significantly greater reductions in anxiety symptoms and enhanced well-being than those who engaged with the standard CBT materials. Importantly, the app was safe, with no increase in adverse events compared to standard care. Our findings suggest that genAI-enabled therapy apps can safely enhance patient engagement and improve clinical outcomes through clinically personalized interventions."

However, despite strong evidence supporting ERP's effectiveness from clinical research and real-world applications, its utilization remains limited. This underuse is often attributed to access barriers such as the scarcity of properly trained therapists, geographical constraints, and costs. Some of these barriers may be addressed with virtual behavioral health, providing ERP for OCD through video teletherapy and supplemented by app-based therapeutic tools and messaging support between sessions. While studies in adults with OCD have shown research efficacy and real-world effectiveness of teletherapy ERP, less is known about outcomes in youth. This study reports on the effectiveness of teletherapy ERP for OCD in the largest sample (N=2173) of child and adolescent patients to date, across the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the UK. Treatment resulted in a median 37.3% decrease in OCD symptoms and 53.4% of youth met full response criteria. Further, there were significant reductions in the severity of concurrent depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. These outcomes were achieved in a relatively small amount of therapist time (median of 13 appointments and 11.5 hours). The observed effect size was substantial and comparable to in-person ERP outcomes. This remote treatment, assisted by technology, is easily accessible to patients and represents a significant advancement in spreading effective and efficient evidence-based care for OCD."

In Northern Ireland, anxiety disorders appear to be more common among the university student population due to the population demographics across the region. Despite the need, these students show less inclination to access the widely available on-campus well-being services and other external professional services. Digital Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) aims to bridge this gap between the need for psychological help and access to it. However, challenges such as limited reach, low adoption, implementation barriers and poor long-term maintenance are mainstay issues resulting in reduced uptake of digital CBT. As a result, the potential impact of digital CBT is currently restricted. The proposed intervention ?쏞erina??is a scalable CBT-based mobile app with an interactive user interface that can be implemented in University settings if found to be feasible and effective. Methods and analysis: The study is a single-blind pilot feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aiming to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of Cerina in reducing Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms. Participants are 90 Ulster University students aged 18 and above with self-reported GAD symptoms. They will be allocated to two conditions: Treatment (i.e., access to Cerina for 6 weeks) and a waitlist control group (i.e., optional on-campus wellbeing services for 6 weeks). Participants in the waitlist will access Cerina 6 weeks after their randomization and participants in both conditions will be assessed at baseline, at 3 (mid-assessment), and 6 weeks (post-assessment). The primary outcome is the feasibility of Cerina (i.e. adherence to the intervention, its usability and the potential to deliver a full trial in the future). The secondary outcomes include generalised anxiety, depression, worry and quality of life. Additionally, participants in both conditions will be invited to semi-structured interviews for process evaluation.

Methods: PRODIGITAL was a single blind, two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial conducted in 46 primary care clinics in Guarulhos, Brazil. Individuals aged 60+ years were randomly contacted by phone for a screening assessment. Those who presented with anhedonia and/or depressed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2), and who subsequently scored between 5 and 9 on the PHQ-9 were invited to participate. The intervention (Viva Vida) arm received a self-help fully automated programme sent via WhatsApp with no support from healthcare professionals. Forty-eight audio and visual messages based on psychoeducation and behavioural activation approaches were delivered over six weeks.

To understand how we can optimize CONEMO in the longer-term, we therefore aim to investigate mediators through which the DMHI improved symptoms of depression at six-months, separately for the two trials and then using a pooled dataset. Methods: We used data that included adults with depression (Patient Health Questionnaire ??9 (PHQ-9) score ??0) and comorbid hypertension and/or diabetes. Interventional effects were used to decompose the total effect of DMHI on symptoms of depression at six months into indirect effects via: understanding the content of the sessions without difficulty; number of activities completed that were self-selected to improve levels of BA; and levels of activation measured using the Behavioural Activation for Depression Short Form (BADS-SF). Findings: Using the pooled dataset, understanding the content of the sessions without difficulty mediated a 10% [0.10: 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.15] improvement in PHQ-9 scores at six months; completing self-selected activities mediated a 12% improvement [0.12: 0.01 to 0.23]; and, lastly, BA mediated a 2% [0.02: 0.01, 0.05] improvement. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that targeting participants to complete activities they find enjoyable will help to improve levels of activation and maintain the effect of the CONEMO intervention in the longer-term. Improving the content of the sessions to facilitate understanding can also help to maintain improvements."

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of a recently developed mHealth programme based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) principles in improving worry. We also examined psychological mindedness (PM) as a mediator by which app engagement is thought to improve outcomes. The intervention group completed a 2-week ?쏛nxiety and Worry??programme with daily CBT-informed activities, while the active waitlist-control completed a matched 2-week mHealth programme on procrastination. Participants filled out the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Psychological Mindedness Scale (PMS) at baseline, post-intervention and 2-week follow-up. App engagement was measured at post-intervention only. Both groups showed significant improvements on anxiety and depression scores from baseline to post-intervention, but no group differences were observed. From post-intervention to follow-up, only the intervention group showed further improvements for anxiety levels. Higher engagement with the mHealth app reported lower anxiety at post-intervention, and this relationship was fully mediated by psychological mindedness. This study provides evidence that (a) engaging in a CBT mHealth App can effectively reduce anxiety and worry, and (b) Psychological mindedness is a potential pathway by which engaging with a mHealthapp improves worry.

Obesity and gut disorders are comorbid with mental health, with the gut microbiome hypothesized to play a key mechanistic role in linking them. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions are currently used to treat mental health disorders, but they have limited efficacy. Dietary and weight-loss interventions have been shown to provide different benefits. Still, there exists conflicting evidence regarding their effects which may be due to an individual?셲 genetic or microbiome factors modulating the improvement of symptoms. Objective: We aimed to identify genetic and gut microbiome factors that explain the improvement in mental health after a dietary and lifestyle intervention for weight loss. Methods: We recruited 369 individuals participating in the Digbi Health personalized digital care program, for which we evaluated the association between 23 genetic scores, the abundance of 178 gut microbiome genera, and 42 gut-brain modules (pathways related to neuroactive metabolites produced by gut microbes) with the presence/absence of anxiety/depression or sleep problems at baseline and improvement on anxiety, depression, and insomnia after losing at least 2% body weight. Results: The mean BMI and age of the study cohort were 34.6 and 48.7, respectively, and there was an overrepresentation of individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders (84%). On average, the individuals lost 5.4% of body weight at the time of follow-up (mean of 88 days), and more than 95% reported improvement in at least one outcome. We found significant correlations between genetic scores with anxiety and depression at baseline, gut microbial functions with sleep problems at baseline, and genetic scores and gut microbial taxa and functions with anxiety, depression, and insomnia improvement. Among the gut microbial functions identified, the abundance of butyrate synthesis genes was associated with less than average improvement in depression symptoms, the abundance of kynurenine synthesis genes was associated with less than average improvement in anxiety symptoms, and the abundance of genes able to synthesize and degrade neuroactive hormones like nitric oxide was associated with greater than average improvement in depression and insomnia symptoms. Among the genetic scores identified, anxiety or depression at baseline were associated with genetic scores for alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder, and greater than average improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms was associated with an obstructive sleep apnea genetic score. Furthermore, a type 1 diabetes genetic score was associated with a greater than average improvement of insomnia symptoms, whereas a type 2 diabetes genetic score was associated with a less than average improvement of insomnia symptoms. We compared the relative ability of demographic, genetic, and microbiome factors to explain baseline and improvement in mental health and found that genetic and microbiome factors provide value above demographic variables alone. Medication and recreational drug use do not confound microbiome associations with mental health. Conclusions: The digital therapeutics care program significantly decreased body weight and concomitantly decreased self-reported mental health symptom intensity. Our results provide evidence that genetic and gut microbiome factors help explain interindividual differences in mental health improvement after dietary and lifestyle interventions for weight loss. Thus, individual genetic and gut microbiome factors provide a basis for designing and further personalizing dietary interventions to improve mental health."

Yet most conventional pain management methods do not take into account the massive role mental health plays in pain sensation and healing. The current paper promotes for a specially trained pain psychologist and psychiatrist role in the pain clinic, concentrating mainly on emotional, cognitive and behavioral part of the composite psychological-biological-environmental model controlling chronic pain. Treatment with pharmaceuticals has a high cost to both the patient and the healthcare system. While psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], mindfulness) have shown better outcomes in coping skills, stress reduction and in improving the quality of life. Pain psychiatrists overall are responsible for treating the mental health comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety which tend to worsen with chronic pain. In addition, they address the common problems of opioid dependence and substance abuse in chronic pain patients. Although such integration has numerous advantages, there are several hurdles that must be overcome, including the compartmentalization of healthcare, stigma and lack of access to mental health experts. Parity in participation was seen as key to the future of pain management, which will continue to evolve and be delivered by multidisciplinary teams using novel digital health tools that support holistic patient-centered care."
10.1016/j.mpmed.2024.08.009,Loneliness and depression in older adults: living well in older age,Bandyopadhyay S.,,2024,1.Nov.24,Review,English,"Loneliness among older adults is complex and subjective, often coexisting with social isolation. Loneliness is an emotional or social experience resulting from a perceived lack of meaningful social relationships and has significant mental and physical health implications. Risk factors include personal attributes, cultural values and life events (e.g. bereavement, relocation). Types of loneliness ??emotional, social, existential ??affect individuals differently throughout life, influenced by family dynamics, socioeconomic factors and personal circumstances. Loneliness can be measured by tools like the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Data suggest its prevalence is increasing, worsened by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Mechanisms linking loneliness to health issues include heightened vigilance, cognitive biases and physiological changes (e.g. impaired sleep, increased stress hormones). Loneliness is linked with depression, dementia, substance abuse and higher mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable groups like older adults, older LGBTQ+ individuals, ethnic minorities and cancer survivors. Intervention strategies include cognitive?밷ehavioural therapy, social prescribing, digital inclusion and community support initiatives. Healthcare providers must adopt comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches. Living well in older age requires an integrated approach, encompassing social, psychological and physical dimensions. Personalized care and technological advancements help maintain social connections and enhance well-being. Promoting healthy ageing and improving life quality for older adults is a collective responsibility."

Between 5% and 30% of women during the pregnancy and postpartum periods may suffer from depression. The management modalities are ranging from coping and support to medications and electroconvulsive therapy. Our study aimed to assess whether digital cognitive behavioural therapy (D.CBT) can improve pregnancy-related mood and sleep disorders. Materials and Methods. We combed four databases, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Randomized control trials comparing D.CBT with any control group for pregnancy-related depression and sleep disorders were selected for this study. Results. We included 14 studies based on the original data of 12 trials. D.CBT significantly decreased the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) after eight weeks compared to the control (MD =-2.77; 95%CI-4.01 to-1.53; p < 0.0001); however, no significant difference after four weeks of intervention or after six weeks of delivery. After eight weeks, D.CBT significantly decreased Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) (SMD =-0.48; 95%CI-0.78 to-0.18; p = 0.002), while after only four weeks, D.CBT was associated with higher IDAS than the control (SMD = 0.56; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.86; p = 0.0002). Also, D.CBT significantly decreased Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) (MD =-1.73; 95%CI-2.63 to-0.83; p = 0.0002), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (MD =-3.45; 95%CI-5.66 to-1.24; p = 0.002) when compared to the control. Conclusions. D.CBT shows some promising outcomes in treating pregnant women?셲 depression and sleep difficulties as decreasing Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), especially after eight weeks of the intervention."

Addressing this gap, we developed and assessed a brief cognitive-behavioral internet-delivered intervention targeting anxiety and depression symptoms in Brazilian youth. METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in youth aged 8–17 with a total T-score ≥70 on the 25-item version of the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale, parent (RCADS-P) and child report (RCADS-C). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to cognitive-behavioral intervention (5 weekly sessions conducted by videoconference focused on skills training) or psychoeducation. Sessions were conducted with youth and their caregivers jointly. Participants were assessed at baseline, at post-treatment and at the 30-day follow-up. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to post-treatment on RCADS-P and RCADS-C scores. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05139433. RESULTS: Between October 15, 2021, and February 27, 2023, 280 participants were randomized, with 231 completing post-treatment and 214 completing follow-up assessments. In comparison to participants in the psychoeducation group, participants in the intervention group showed greater reductions in emotional symptoms according to youths (mean difference = 4.3, p = .013, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05–0.44]) and parents (mean difference = 3.6, p = .023, SMD = .21 [95% CI 0.03–0.40]), as well as in anxiety scores according to youths (mean difference = 4.4, p = .0043, SMD = 0.28 [95% CI 0.09–0.47]) and parents (mean difference = 3.2, p = .030, SMD = 0.21 [95% CI 0.02–0.40]). There were no significant differences in depression scores at post-treatment according to youth (mean difference = 2.9, p = .063, SMD = 0.19 [95% CI −0.01 to 0.39]) or parents (mean difference = 2.2, p = .15, SMD = 0.15 [95% CI −0.05 to 0.33]), but effects emerged at the 30-day follow-up. No serious adverse events were reported. DISCUSSION: The cognitive-behavioral intervention was effective in reducing emotional symptoms in children and adolescents in Brazil. This intervention holds promise for enhancing access to mental health care within a stepped-care model in public health contexts.

10.24193/jebp.2025.1.1,The effect of a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based e-psychological support program for healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial,"Türk, Fulya;Kul, Aykut;Hamamcı, Zeynep;Sungur, Mehmet Zihni;Kocamer Şahin, Şengül;Elboğa, Gülçin",Journal of Evidence-Based Psychotherapies,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has exerted profound physical and psychological tolls on healthcare professionals, underscoring the urgent need for their mental health support. The objectives of this research are twofold: first, to develop an e-psychological support program based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy tailored specifically for healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic; second, to assess the program's effectiveness in reducing secondary traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and stress levels, as well as improving healthcare professionals' perception of coping with trauma. Designed as a randomized controlled trial, the study was conducted with 71 healthcare workers employed in a hospital in Gaziantep, Turkey. The developed e-psychological support program consists of six modules: stress model, self-monitoring skills, coping with anxiety, behavioral activation skills, and cognitive restructuring (two modules). The results showing a significant decrease in anxiety, depression, stress and secondary traumatic levels in the intervention group compared to the control group are encouraging. This suggests that the CBT-based e-psychological support program has the potential to have a positive impact on the mental well-being of healthcare professionals. Also, the improvement in healthcare professionals' perception of coping with trauma is an important outcome.CBT has a strong evidence base for treating mental health issues, and adapting it for the specific needs of healthcare workers during a crisis like the pandemic is a promising approach. The development of online interventions for healthcare professionals is valuable not only for the current pandemic but also for future crisis situations. These programs can serve as a template for addressing mental health needs during other global health emergencies.

However, few studies explore mediators that may shed light on longitudinal associations or causal pathways. Proposed theories suggest that reduced engagement in meaningful and rewarding activities outside of gaming may initiate a cycle of increased dependence on gaming to derive reward, but empirical evidence is lacking. The current study assessed a series of micro-longitudinal mediation models analyzing relationships between (1) time spent gaming and gaming disorder and (2) depressive symptoms and gaming disorder, with behavioral activation level set as a potential mediator. Daily video game players (n = 98) were recruited to complete three waves of measures assessing negative emotion and game-play characteristics during a baseline session and weekly follow-ups over 2 weeks. Self-reported time spent gaming was associated with decreased levels of behavioral activation, which subsequently, was associated with elevated gaming disorder symptoms. Similarly, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with increased gaming disorder symptoms via lower behavioral activation levels. However, both models demonstrated non-significant indirect effects when baseline values of variables (thus assessing change) were controlled for. Additionally, meaningful differences between objective logged data and subjective self-report estimates of time spent gaming were observed and may explain discrepancies across models examining this variable. The current results indicate that both depressive symptoms and behavioral activation levels may play important roles in the development of problematic gaming patterns; however, further research is needed to build confidence for causal relationships between these variables. Future directions and specific recommendations for advancing the current findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Current evidence supports the effectiveness of the digital format, but clinical findings are often limited by the choice of control group and lack of in‐depth therapeutic measures. This study was designed to investigate the specific effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in comparison to a self‐monitoring application. Participants meeting criteria for insomnia were randomly allocated (1:1) to 8 weeks of digital cognitive behavioural therapy or 8 weeks of digital sleep monitoring (control application). The primary outcome, insomnia severity, was assessed at baseline, 8‐ and 16‐weeks post‐randomisation. Secondary outcomes included the assessment of sleep via application‐integrated sleep diaries and actigraphy. Linear‐mixed models were fitted to assess between‐group differences. Fifty‐six participants (48 females, mean age: M = 45.55 ± 13.70 years) were randomised to either digital cognitive behavioural therapy ( n = 29) or digital sleep monitoring ( n = 27). At 8‐ and 16‐weeks post‐randomisation, large treatment effects ( d = 0.87–1.08) indicated robust reductions (−3.70 and −2.97, respectively; p ≤ 0.003) in insomnia severity in the digital cognitive behavioural therapy arm, relative to digital sleep monitoring. Treatment effects in favour of digital cognitive behavioural therapy were also found for self‐reported and actigraphy‐derived sleep continuity variables, indicating that sleep improved throughout the 8‐week intervention period. Our study reinforces the role of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in achieving clinical improvements for patients with insomnia, affirming previous findings and supporting the specific effects of cognitive behavioural therapy.

Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association between physical activity and suicidal behavior and identify mediating factors involved in the association among medical students from the United States. Methods: Data from the Healthy Minds Study (2007–2023) were used. Physical activity and suicidal behavior (i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts) were self-reported. Control variables included age, gender, ethnicity/race, relationship status, citizenship, current financial stress, and academic year. Mediating factors were flourishing, generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, eating disorder symptoms, binge drinking, smoking, and drug use. Results: There were 6452 medical students included in the study (median [IQR] age 25.0 [3.0] years; 4032 [62.5 %] women). After adjusting for control variables, compared with &lt; 1 hour of physical activity per week, the odds of any suicidal behavior were significantly lower for 3–4 hours (OR = 0.57, 95 % CI = 0.41–0.79) and ≥ 5 hours of physical activity per week (OR = 0.52, 95 % CI = 0.39–0.70). The physical activity-any suicidal behavior relationship was partially explained by decreased depressive symptoms (39.4 %), increased flourishing (27.6 %), and decreased generalized anxiety disorder symptoms (18.7 %). Limitations: Data are of a cross-sectional nature. Conclusions: There was an inverse association between physical activity and suicidal behavior in medical students from the United States, while several variables were identified as mediating factors (i.e., depressive symptoms, flourishing, and general anxiety disorder symptoms). Further research is needed to corroborate these findings in other settings, while longitudinal data are urgently warranted.

However, few studies have targeted low income women who are at high risk for postpartum depression. Methods: This study examined the efficacy of a novel remote physical activity intervention designed to prevent perinatal depression (assessed at 36 weeks gestation and 12 week postpartum). Participants (n = 111) who were low income and pregnant (less than 20 weeks) were randomly assigned to either a six month intervention focusing on increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary behavior (remote counseling sessions based on Self-Determination Theory) or usual care. All participants wore a Fitbit throughout the study to monitor their activity levels. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Perceived Stress Scale were administered at baseline, 36 weeks gestation, and 12 weeks postpartum. Results: There was no effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms or perceived stress at either of the timepoints. Secondary analysis indicated that lower levels of sedentary behavior, β = 0.256, p &lt; 0.05, and higher levels of light activity at 8–12 weeks postpartum was related to lower perceived stress at 12 weeks postpartum, β = −0.284, p &lt; 0.05. Conclusion: Even though there was no effect of the intervention on preventing depression and stress, it continues to be important for clinicians to discuss the importance of activity during the perinatal phase due to the many health benefits. There is some evidence that sedentary and physical activity behavior may be important for reducing stress levels, however, additional research is needed.

E.;Renner, Fritz",Clinical Psychology in Europe,,2023.6.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Behavioral activation (BA) is an effective and efficacious treatment for depression. Activity scheduling is the central treatment component of BA and involves planning of potentially enjoyable and rewarding activities. Evidence from non-clinical studies suggests that mental imagery simulations of planned activities can increase motivation and anticipated pleasure for these activities. Method: We describe a randomized controlled trial testing a mental imagery activity scheduling training delivered online in four weekly sessions (total training duration approximately 90 minutes) in a sample meeting diagnostic criteria of a major depressive episode, as indicated by the Diagnostic Short-Interview for Mental Disorders (Mini-DIPS), and not currently receiving treatment. Participants (N = 140) will be randomized to either mental imagery activity scheduling or a wait-list control condition. Depressive symptoms (BDI-II) and behavioral activation (BADS) are the primary outcomes; BDI-II will be measured at Session 1, Session 4, and at two-week follow- up, BADS at Sessions 1-4 and at two-week follow-up. Discussion: It is discussed how the expected results may reflect mechanisms and effects of a mental imagery activity scheduling training delivered online in a sample of individuals with depression. Concluding we outline next steps for future research and highlight the potential of this novel treatment for dissemination in the wider community and integration into routine care.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of remote cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, specifically, treatment fully delivered through the internet, mobile phones and telephones for sleep and other health outcomes in adults diagnosed with insomnia or reporting insomnia symptoms. This study also aimed to evaluate the effect of various intervention components as subgroup variables to explain the efficacy of remote cognitive behavioural therapy on health outcomes. Methods Randomised controlled trial studies were obtained from five electronic databases. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. A random effect model was used to assess the mean difference, standardised mean difference and standard deviation of the outcome variables. Heterogeneity among the study articles was assessed using I2 and Q tests. Egger regression analysis was used to assess publication bias. Results Remote cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia had significant and positive effects on improving sleep outcomes, depression, anxiety, fatigue and mental health compared with the control conditions. Its effect on physical health was not significant. The effect of the therapy was enhanced when the total length of intervention was shorter than 6 weeks, delivered via the internet and did not include therapist support.

Therefore, the body might be a promising target for the treatment of depression. Based on these notions, we developed Body, Breath and Mind (BBM) a minimally monitored online intervention combining body orientated Qi Gong practice with elements of behavioral activation (BA). This study aims to assess the feasibility of BBM. Methods One hundred and ten adults showing at least moderate levels of depression were recruited and a single group pre-/post-test design was used. BBM consists of eight modules including Qi Gong as well as BA homework practice. Instructions for Qi Gong practice were given via video. Feasibility outcome measures included treatment adherence, preliminary effectiveness, satisfaction and practice time. Primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessing depressive symptoms. Results We found significant reduction of depressive symptoms with a large effect size (dAV = – 1.82) and participants were satisfied with Qi Gong and BA elements as well as with the entire program. Thirty-four participants (31%) completed all eight modules. Conclusions The findings suggest that it would be feasible to proceed to a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the potential of BBM, a program combining body-oriented and BA elements.

A two‐arm parallel randomized waiting‐list controlled trial with 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐ups were conducted in a secondary vocational school in mainland China. Participants Participants comprised 77 Chinese adolescents with GD symptoms with a mean age of 16.36 years [standard deviation (SD) = 0.93]; 88.3% were male Interventions Participants were randomized into an ICBT group (n = 38) and a waiting‐list control (WLC, n = 39) group. ICBT intervention comprised eight weekly sessions to encourage participants to identify their interests and strengths and set goals for developing personally meaningful real‐life activities. Measurements and Findings The outcomes were measured at pre‐treatment (t0), post‐treatment (t1), 3‐month (t2) and 6‐month (t3) follow‐ups. The primary outcome was GD symptoms at t3. Secondary outcomes included GD symptoms at t1 and t2, and gaming motivation, maladaptive gaming cognition, depression and anxiety symptoms at t1, t2 and t3. With the intention‐to‐treat principle, the GD scores at t3 were significantly different between the CBT and WLC groups [mean difference 62.08 (SD = 10.48) versus 73.64 (SD = 11.70); Hedges’ g = 1.15, 95% confidence interval = 0.67–1.62]. Linear mixed‐effects modeling showed significant group × time interaction for the secondary outcomes (P &lt; 0.01), with a moderate to strong between‐group effect size in the reduction in depression symptoms (g = 0.67–0.84) and anxiety symptoms (g = 0.6–0.64). Path analysis shows ICBT leads to GD reduction through reducing gaming motivation and maladaptive gaming cognition. Conclusions An integrated cognitive–behavioral therapy with strength‐based motivational approach intervention reduced gaming disorder symptoms and time spent gaming over a 6‐month period by decreasing maladaptive gaming motivation and cognition.

Y.;de Keijser, J.;Boelen, P. A.",Cognitive Behaviour Therapy,,2023.2.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Prolonged grief disorder, a condition characterized by severe, persistent, and disabling grief, is newly included in ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR. Prolonged grief symptoms can be effectively treated with face-to-face or internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy. Traumatic losses may elicit higher prevalence of severe grief reactions. While face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy appears efficacious in treating prolonged grief symptoms in traumatically bereaved individuals, it is not yet clear if internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy is efficacious for this population. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of a 12-week internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for people bereaved through traffic accidents in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (registration number: NL7497, Dutch Trial Register). Forty adults bereaved though a traffic accident were randomized to internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 19) or a waitlist control condition (n = 21). Prolonged grief, post-traumatic stress, and depression symptoms were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 8-week follow-up. Dropout in the treatment condition was relatively high (42%) compared to the control condition (19%). Nevertheless, multilevel analyses showed that internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy strongly reduced prolonged grief, post-traumatic stress, and depression symptoms relative to the control condition at post-treatment and follow-up. We conclude that internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy appears a promising treatment for traumatically bereaved adults.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-25750-022). Background: Internet-cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression can include multiple components. This study explored depressive symptom improvement prognostic factors (PFs) and effect modifiers (EMs) for five common iCBT components including behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, self-monitoring, and assertion training. Methods: We used data from a factorial trial of iCBT for subthreshold depression among Japanese university students ( N = 1093). The primary outcome was the change in PHQ-9 scores at 8 weeks from baseline. Interactions between each component and various baseline characteristics were estimated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. We calculated multiplicity-adjusted p -values at 5 % false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Results: After multiplicity adjustment, the baseline PHQ-9 total score emerged as a PF and exercise habits as an EM for self-monitoring (adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05). The higher the PHQ-9 total score at baseline (range: 5–14), the greater the decrease after 8 weeks. For each 5-point increase at baseline, the change from baseline to 8 weeks was bigger by 2.8 points. The more frequent the exercise habits (range: 0–2 points), the less effective the self-monitoring component. The difference in PHQ-9 change scores between presence or absence of self-monitoring was smaller by 0.94 points when the participant exercised one level more frequently. Additionally, the study suggested seven out of 36 PFs and 14 out of 160 EMs examined were candidates for future research. Limitations: Generalizability is limited to university students with subthreshold depression. Conclusions: These results provide some helpful information for the future development of individualized iCBT algorithms for depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)"

However, early client or user involvement is crucial. The smartphone application and dashboard ‘plaTfOrm using evidence-based inTervEntions for (Mental) health’ (TOTEM), based on cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation, is being developed together with clients from the start. Objective monitoring (e.g., activity/travel-related behavior) and human-in-the-loop AI machine learning allow tailored blended care, combining face-to-face therapy with online modules and Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. As a first co-creation step, clients with (prior) depression or depressive complaints and psychologists evaluated the usefulness of an existing Health for Travel Behaviour (HTB) application and feedback report developed for cardio patients, which monitors and improves travel-related physical activity. Online semi-structured interviews followed an HTB demonstration. In total, 16 interviews (14 clients and 2 psychologists) were transcribed and analyzed. Participants perceived the application as user-friendly, relevant, useful, attractive, and a supplement to standard care. It encourages people to engage in activities. The feedback report was also perceived as transparent, useful, and relevant. Emotional aspects are underemphasized (e.g., assessment of feelings and mental health-related psycho-education). When tailored to depression (with attention for different recovery phases), monitoring and improving travel-related physical activity was considered helpful in supplementing standard care for depression.

Douglas;Zaharakis, Nikola;Russell, Michael;Wallis, Dorothy;Brown, Aaron;Hale, Christopher",Behavior Therapy,,2022.3.4,Scholarly Journals,English,"Young adults (ages 18 to 25) in the U.S. suffer from the highest rates of past-year major depressive episode and are the least likely to receive treatment compared to other age groups. As such, we examined the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text-message delivered cognitive behavioral therapy: CBT-txt with young adults. The study was a 2-month pilot RCT to test a 4-week intervention for depression that contained 197 text messages (average 12 texts every other day). The sample, recruited via Facebook and Instagram, was 102 U.S. young adults who presented with at least moderate depressive symptomatology. Assessments occurred at baseline prior to randomization and at 1 and 2 months post enrollment. The primary outcome, severity of depressive symptoms, was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II. Feasibility benchmarks were met and participants reported high levels of engagement with and acceptability of the intervention. Logistic regression indicated that treatment participants were three times as likely to have minimal or mild depression symptoms at 2 months compared to waitlist control participants. Latent change score modeling found that the strongest significant treatment effect appeared at the 1-month follow-up period, particularly for participants who began with severe depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis revealed significant indirect treatment effects of increases in behavioral activation on reducing depressive symptoms, suggesting a mechanism of change. Limitations were that the sample was relatively small and consisted of primarily women. These results provide initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text-delivered treatment for young adult depression.

The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), which is derived from health psychology, can provide a motivational-volitional framework of BA. Objective: This study investigated the efficacy of a HAPA-based internet-delivered BA intervention (iBA; called InterAKTIV) in individuals with depression, also assessing HAPA-based motivational and volitional outcomes. Methods: In a two-arm randomized controlled efficacy trial with a parallel design, 128 participants with a major depressive episode were randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG; TAU + immediate access to iBA) or control group (CG; TAU + access to iBA after follow-up). The primary outcome of clinician-rated depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), 8 weeks (T2), 6-month after randomization (T3). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Linear mixed model analyses revealed a significant group*time interaction effect on clinician-rated depressive symptoms favoring the IG (F 2, 156.0 = 7.40; p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.79 at T2, d = 0.25 at T3). The IG was also superior regarding self-rated depressive symptoms, BA, most motivational, and all volitional outcomes. Conclusion: This study shows that HAPA-based iBA can significantly improve clinician-rated depressive symptoms, as well as outcomes used in the HAPA model in people with depression. Building on these efficacy results, in the next step, the relationship between BA interventions and activity levels should be investigated, taking into account motivation and volition as potential mediators.

10.2196/40268,Long-term effectiveness and predictors of transdiagnostic Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for emotional disorders in specialized care: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"González-Robles, Alberto;Roca, Pablo;Díaz-García, Amanda;García-Palacios, Azucena;Botella, Cristina",JMIR Mental Health,,2022.6.14,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Transdiagnostic internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for emotional disorders has been shown to be effective in specialized care in the short term. However, less is known about its long-term effects in this specific setting. In addition, predictors of long-term effectiveness may help to identify what treatments are more suitable for certain individuals. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the long-term effectiveness of transdiagnostic iCBT compared with that of treatment as usual (TAU) in specialized care and explore predictors of long-term effectiveness. Methods: Mixed models were performed to analyze the long-term effectiveness and predictors of transdiagnostic iCBT (n = 99) versus TAU (n = 101) in public specialized mental health care. Outcomes included symptoms of depression and anxiety, health-related quality of life (QoL), behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation, comorbidity, and diagnostic status (ie, loss of principal diagnosis) from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, and education) and clinical variables (principal diagnosis, comorbidity, and symptom severity at baseline) were selected as predictors of long-term changes. Results: Compared with baseline, transdiagnostic iCBT was more effective than TAU in improving symptoms of depression ( b = –4.16, SE 1.80, 95% CI –7.68 to –0.67), health-related QoL ( b = 7.63, SE 3.41, 95% CI 1.00-14.28), diagnostic status ( b = –0.24, SE 0.09, 95% CI –1.00 to –0.15), and comorbidity at 1-year follow-up ( b = –0.58, SE 0.22, 95% CI –1.00 to –0.15). From pretreatment assessment to follow-up, anxiety symptoms improved in both transdiagnostic iCBT and TAU groups, but no significant differences were found between the groups. Regarding the predictors of the long-term effectiveness of transdiagnostic iCBT compared with that of TAU, higher health-related QoL at follow-up was predicted by a baseline diagnosis of anxiety, male sex, and the use of psychiatric medication; fewer comorbid disorders at follow-up were predicted by older age and higher baseline scores on health-related QoL; and fewer depressive symptoms at follow-up were predicted by baseline diagnosis of depression. However, this pattern was not observed for baseline anxiety diagnoses and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest that transdiagnostic iCBT is more effective than TAU to target depressive symptoms among patients with emotional disorders. Anxiety symptoms remained stable at 1-year follow-up, with no differences between the groups. Results on predictors suggest that some groups of patients may obtain specific gains after transdiagnostic iCBT. Specifically, and consistent with the literature, patients with baseline depression improved their depression scores at follow-up. However, this pattern was not found for baseline anxiety disorders. More studies on the predictor role of sociodemographic and clinical variables in long-term outcomes of transdiagnostic iCBT are warranted. Future studies should focus on studying the implementation of transdiagnostic iCBT in Spanish public specialized mental health care.

10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.05.031,Effects of internet-delivered behavioral activation on individuals with depressive symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Han, Areum;Kim, Tae Hui",Journal of Psychiatric Research,,2021.11.16,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Behavioral activation is recognized as a stand-alone, evidence-based therapy for depression. Internet-delivered psychological interventions are easy to access and low cost. Therefore, it is important to determine whether internet-delivered behavioral activation (iBA) is an effective option for improving depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of iBA on individuals with depressive symptoms. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted within four databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved iBA for people with depressive symptoms. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. Depending on I² statistic values for heterogeneity, either a random effects model or fixed effects model was used. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the type of control groups. Results: Twenty RCTs met the eligibility criteria. Meta-analyses showed iBA had small to medium effects on depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, functioning, perceived social support, and behavioral activation (BA) in people suffering from depressive symptoms at the immediate posttest and follow-up compared to control conditions. Limitations: Relatively fewer studies were conducted to compare effects of iBA on outcomes other than depressive symptoms and BA process measures compared to comparison or control conditions. The overall risk of bias across the included RCTs was unclear. Conclusions: Further high-quality studies are needed to verify the effects of iBA on varied health outcomes and BA process measures for individuals with depressive symptoms.

With the widespread use of the internet, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy has been developed and applied to control symptoms and improve the quality of life of those with irritable bowel syndrome. However, few studies have systematically reviewed the effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy on irritable bowel syndrome. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review studies that examined the use of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and to evaluate the effects of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy on the improvement of symptom severity, quality of life, psychological status, and cost-effectiveness. Methods: This meta-analysis involved the search of 6 databases for relevant publications. From the 1224 publications identified through database searches, 9 randomized controlled trials were finally included in the analysis. Results: The internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies including exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy for self-management, and cognitive behavioral therapy for stress management were provided in 5 to 13 sessions for 5 to 10 weeks. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy had medium-to-large effects on symptom severity (standardized mean difference [SMD] –0.633; 95% CI –0.861 to –0.4304), quality of life (SMD 0.582; 95% CI 0.396-0.769), and cost-effectiveness (–0.372; 95% CI –0.704 to –0.039) at postintervention. The effects on symptom severity remained over time even after the intervention, short-term follow-up (SMD –0.391; 95% CI –0.560 to –0.221), and long-term follow-up (SMD –0.357; 95% CI –0.541 to –0.172). There was no significant difference in psychological status, including anxiety and depression, in those with irritable bowel syndrome compared to the controls during the postintervention period. Conclusions: This review demonstrates that internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy could be a cost-effective intervention for improving symptoms and the quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. However, studies are still insufficient regarding the use of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy in these patients; therefore, more high-quality studies are required in the future.

This article specifically addresses the scientific, theoretical, and practice contributions in CBT for depression, and reviews prominent efficacy trials and meta-analyses based on this model. Innovations such as the development and evaluation of behavioral activation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and specific applications are discussed. Canadian psychologists have further conducted a large number of studies that examine the moderators and mediators of treatment outcomes, to understand the mechanisms by which these evidence-based therapies may work and who may benefit the most from them. The article ends with a discussion of potential future areas for the ongoing contribution of Canadian psychologists to the treatment of depression. These include the deployment of stepped care models, as well as standards for education and training both for psychologists and other allied health professionals, and international training and dissemination.

MoodMission is a MHapp that targets low mood and anxiety via evidence-based techniques including behavioural activation (BA). Aims: The present study aimed to investigate (i) whether BA interventions delivered with visual psychoeducation had greater engagement than BA interventions delivered with solely written psychoeducation, (ii) whether BA interventions targeting mastery would have greater engagement than those targeting pleasure, and (iii) the relationship between level of engagement and MHapp benefit. Method: Participants downloaded MoodMission and completed activities and within-app evaluations over a 30-day period. Data from 238 MoodMission users were analysed via multi-level modelling and linear regression. Results: The average number of app-based activities completed was 5.46 and the average self-reported engagement level was in the low to moderate range. As hypothesized, higher levels of engagement significantly predicted more positive activity appraisal. Conclusions: The results suggest that BA technique beliefs are involved in MHapp engagement and future research examining user appraisals of techniques is warranted.

10.1037/hea0001046,A novel method for assessing design fidelity in web-based behavioral interventions,"Lambert, Jeffrey D.;Elliott, Lewis R.;Taylor, Adrian H.;Farrand, Paul;Haase, Anne M.;Greaves, Colin J.",Health Psychology,,2019.10.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Delivery is one of the most common ways of assessing fidelity in behavioral interventions. However, there is a lack of research reporting on how well an intervention protocol reflects its proposed theoretical principles (design fidelity). This study presents a systematic method for assessing design fidelity and applies it to the eMotion web-based intervention targeting physical activity and depression. Method: The eMotion intervention comprises of 13 web-based modules, designed according to an underlying intervention map. An independent rater with expertise in behavior change coded the presence or absence of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in the content of eMotion. Results of coding were compared to the intervention designers’ a priori specification for interrater reliability. Results: After discussion, the independent rater and the intervention designer had a high agreement for the presence of BCTs relating to behavioral activation (AC1 = 0.91) with “demonstration of behavior” and “monitoring of emotional consequences” having the lowest agreement (AC1 &lt; 0.4). There was also high agreement for the presence of BCTs targeting physical activity (AC1 = 0.88) with “demonstration of behavior” and “monitoring of emotional consequences” having the lowest agreement (AC1 &lt; 0.4). The eMotion description was then amended to align the interrater agreement. Conclusions: This study presents a novel method for assessing design fidelity. Developers of behavioral (and other multicomponent) interventions are encouraged to develop and refine this method and assess design fidelity in future interventions to ensure BCTs are operationalized as intended.

10.2196/16112,"Impact of the method of delivering electronic health behavior change interventions in survivors of cancer on engagement, health behaviors, and health outcomes: Systematic Review and meta-analysis","Furness, Kate;Sarkies, Mitchell N.;Huggins, Catherine E.;Croagh, Daniel;Haines, Terry P.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2019.9.3,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Increased accessibility to the internet and mobile devices has seen a rapid expansion in electronic health (eHealth) behavior change interventions delivered to patients with cancer and survivors using synchronous, asynchronous, and combined delivery methods. Characterizing effective delivery methods of eHealth interventions is required to enable improved design and implementation of evidence-based health behavior change interventions. Objective: This study aims to systematically review the literature and synthesize evidence on the success of eHealth behavior change interventions in patients with cancer and survivors delivered by synchronous, asynchronous, or combined methods compared with a control group. Engagement with the intervention, behavior change, and health outcomes, including quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, were examined. Methods: A search of Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, and PubMed was conducted for studies published between March 2007 and March 2019. We looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining interventions delivered to adult cancer survivors via eHealth methods with a measure of health behavior change. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to examine whether the method of eHealth delivery impacted the level of engagement, behavior change, and health outcomes. Results: A total of 24 RCTs were included predominantly examining dietary and physical activity behavior change interventions. There were 11 studies that used a synchronous approach and 11 studies that used an asynchronous approach, whereas 2 studies used a combined delivery method. Use of eHealth interventions improved exercise behavior (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.48), diet behavior (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-0.70), fatigue (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.50; SMD change 0.22, 95% CI 0.09-0.35), anxiety (SMD 1.21, 95% CI: 0.36-2.07; SMD change 0.15, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.40), depression (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00-0.30), and quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI −0.10 to 0.34; SMD change 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.24). The mode of delivery did not influence the amount of dietary and physical activity behavior change observed. Conclusions: Physical activity and dietary behavior change eHealth interventions delivered to patients with cancer or survivors have a small to moderate impact on behavior change and a small to very small benefit to quality of life, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether asynchronous or synchronous delivery modes yield superior results. Three-arm RCTs comparing delivery modes with a control with robust engagement reporting are required to determine the most successful delivery method for promoting behavior change and ultimately favorable health outcomes.

10.2196/15312,Brief web-based intervention for depression: Randomized controlled trial on behavioral activation,"Jelinek, Lena;Arlt, Sönke;Moritz, Steffen;Schröder, Johanna;Westermann, Stefan;Cludius, Barbara",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2019.7.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective for the treatment of depression. However, interventions are often complex and include a variety of elements, making it difficult to identify the most effective component(s). Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to shed light on mechanisms in the online treatment of depression by comparing a single-module, fully automated intervention for depression (internet-based behavioral activation [iBA]) to a nonoverlapping active control intervention and a nonactive control group. Methods: We assessed 104 people with at least mild depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, &gt; 4) via the internet at baseline (t₀) and 2 weeks (t₁) and 4 weeks (t₂) later. After the t₀ assessment, participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) iBA (n = 37), (2) active control using a brief internet-based mindfulness intervention (iMBI, n = 32), or (3) care as usual (CAU, n = 35). The primary outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms, as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Secondary parameters included changes in activity, dysfunctional attitudes, and quality of life Results: While groups did not differ regarding the change in depression from t₀ to t₁ (η p ² = .007, P = .746) or t₀ to t₂ (η p ² = .008, P = .735), iBA was associated with a larger decrease in dysfunctional attitudes from t₀ to t₂ in comparison to CAU (η p² = .053, P = .04) and a larger increase in activity from t₀ to t₁ than the pooled control groups (η p ² = .060, P = .02). A change in depression from t₀ to t₂ was mediated by a change in activity from t0 to t₁. At t₁, 22% (6/27) of the participants in the iBA group and 12% (3/25) of the participants in the iMBI group indicated that they did not use the intervention. Conclusions: Although we did not find support for the short-term efficacy of the single-module iBA regarding depression, long-term effects are still conceivable, potentially initiated by changes in secondary outcomes. Future studies should use a longer intervention and follow-up interval. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Whether casual mobile game playing has a cognitive, physiological, or behavioral effect on players whose game use is not pathological is unknown. Here we explored whether preattentive auditory processing is linked to the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) in frequent and infrequent game players. A total of 74 subjects who were enrolled in our study were divided into two groups, 40 subjects were frequent gamers and 34 subjects were age-, gender-, IQ-, and education-matched infrequent gamers. All participants underwent a passive auditory oddball paradigm and completed the behavioral inhibition/behavioral activation system scales. The mismatch negativity (MMN) latency was shorter for the frequent gamers relative to the infrequent gamers, whereas no difference in MMN amplitude was found between groups. MMN amplitude was negatively associated with the degree of behavioral inhibition in the frequent and infrequent gaming group. We also found that those who frequently play games show an enhanced processing speed, which could be an effect of game practice. Greater behavioral inhibition induces increased vigilance, and this may have enhanced the MMN amplitude in the infrequent gamers. This differential pattern of correlations suggests that differences in the BIS could lead to different approaches to auditory information processing.

In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of atomoxetine (ATM) and methylphenidate (MPH) on problematic online gaming in adolescents with ADHD. Methods: We recruited 86 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD together with Internet gaming disorder. These participants were divided into two treatment groups: 44 participants were treated with MPH for 12 weeks, and 42 participants were treated with ATM for 12 weeks. Results: During the 3‐month study period, the MPH group showed greater improvement in Korean ADHD rating scale scores than the ATM group. The ATM group showed greater improvement in Child Depression Inventory scores than the MPH group. However, Young Internet Addiction Scale and Behavioral Inhibition &amp; Activation Scales score changes did not differ significantly between the MPH and ATM groups. In both groups, changes in Young Internet Addiction Scale scores were positively correlated with the changes in Behavioral Inhibition &amp; Activation Scales scores. Conclusions: Both MPH and ATM reduced the severity of Internet gaming disorder symptoms, and this reduction was correlated with impulsivity reduction, which also resulted from both ADHD medications. These findings suggest impulsivity plays a critical role in the development of problematic online gaming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

However, little is known about the mechanisms that maintain this behavior. We recruited a sample of 308 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk labor market. Participants responded to standardized measures of problematic smartphone use, and frequency of smartphone use, depression and anxiety and possible mechanisms including behavioral activation, need for touch, fear of missing out (FoMO), and emotion regulation. Problematic smartphone use was most correlated with anxiety, need for touch and FoMO. The frequency of use was most correlated (inversely) with depression. In regression models, problematic smartphone use was associated with FoMO, depression (inversely), anxiety, and need for touch. Frequency of use was associated with need for touch, and (inversely) with depressive symptoms. Behavioral activation mediated associations between smartphone use (both problematic and usage frequency) and depression and anxiety symptoms. Emotional suppression also mediated the association between problematic smartphone use and anxiety. Results demonstrate the importance of social and tactile need fulfillment variables such as FoMO and need for touch as critical mechanisms that can explain problematic smartphone use and its association with depression and anxiety.

However, most prior research relating internet addiction symptomatology to depressive symptoms has been cross-sectional, conducted with children and adolescents, and only examined depressive symptoms as a broad construct. The purpose of the current study was to examine potential longitudinal associations between anhedonia (i.e., difficulty experiencing pleasure, a key facet of depression) and internet-related addictive behaviors in 503 at-risk emerging adults (former attendees of alternative high schools). Participants completed surveys at baseline and approximately one year later (9–18 months later). Results indicated that trait anhedonia prospectively predicted greater levels of compulsive internet use and addiction to online activities as well as a greater likelihood of addiction to online/offline video games. These findings suggest that anhedonia may contribute to the development of internet-related addictive behaviors in the emerging adult population. Thus, interventions that target anhedonia in emerging adulthood (e.g., bupropion treatment or behavioral activation therapy) may help prevent or treat internet addiction.

University students with non‐low‐weight eating disorders ( N = 89) completed a mobile guided self‐help cognitive behavioural intervention for eating disorders. Insomnia and binge‐eating symptoms were assessed at pre‐treatment and end‐of‐treatment using the Insomnia Severity Index and Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory. Multiply imputed datasets were used to test associations between insomnia and binge eating before, during and after treatment. Insomnia was positively associated with binge‐eating symptoms prior to treatment ( r = 0.47). Baseline insomnia symptoms were associated with binge‐eating symptoms at end‐of‐treatment (est = 0.269). Eating disorder treatment modestly reduced insomnia ( d = −0.38); however, about half of people with clinically significant insomnia prior to treatment remained symptomatic. Insomnia symptoms and binge‐eating symptoms did not change concurrently during treatment. Overall, results support an association between insomnia and binge eating. Although eating disorder treatment may impact insomnia, many individuals remained symptomatic for sleep problems, suggesting the need for follow‐up treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, or the development of integrated insomnia–eating disorder treatments. Future studies are needed to examine causal links between insomnia and eating disorder symptoms, and test if insomnia predicts relapse after eating disorder treatment.

Data from a survey of 815 participants were analyzed using SAS© software. Significant models were identified through model effects tests, pinpointing key variables linked to the use of smartphones. The study’s major findings reveal that extended smartphone use is associated with physical problems such as vision impairment and musculoskeletal discomfort, psychological issues including depression, concentration difficulties and sleep disturbances, and social consequences line with tendency to prioritise smartphone use over outdoor activities. Additionally, behavioral patterns such as snacking, increased inactivity, and using smartphones before sleep were observed. Children with shorter durations of smartphone usage were less likely to experience these negative effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

In this study, we report outcomes from a living systematic review of these studies. We use Poisson regression analyses to examine if the proportions of studies have changed over time across the characteristics of the participants, therapies, and studies. We also present a meta-analysis of the effects across the major types, formats, targets, and age groups. We included 562 randomized controlled trials (669 comparisons; 66,361 patients). Most trials are conducted in adults and the relative proportion of trials in children and adolescents, as well as in older patients is significantly decreasing. The effects in children and adolescents are also significantly smaller than in adults ( p = .007). Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is by far the best examined type of therapy (52%), but not necessarily more effective than other therapies. Over time, the proportion of studies examining several other types of therapy is significantly decreased compared to CBT. The quality of trials has increased over time, but still, a majority do not meet basic quality criteria, not even in recent years. The effects found in studies with low risk of bias are significantly smaller than in other studies ( b = −0.21; SE = 0.05; p &lt; .001). Most trials are conducted in the United States, but the proportion of studies in other parts of the world is rapidly increasing. The evidence that psychotherapies are effective is strong and growing every year. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.2196/69080,Digital gaming and subsequent health and well-being among older adults: Longitudinal outcome-wide analysis,"Nakagomi, Atsushi;Ide, Kazushige;Kondo, Katsunori;Shiba, Koichiro",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2024.11.21,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Digital gaming has become increasingly popular among older adults, potentially offering cognitive, social, and physical benefits. However, its broader impact on health and well-being, particularly in real-world settings, remains unclear. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the multidimensional effects of digital gaming on health and well-being among older adults, using data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study conducted in Matsudo City, Chiba, Japan. Methods: Data were drawn from 3 survey waves (2020 prebaseline, 2021 baseline, and 2022 follow-up) of the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, which targets functionally independent older adults. The exposure variable, digital gaming, was defined as regular video game play and was assessed in 2021. In total, 18 outcomes across 6 domains were evaluated in 2022; domain 1—happiness and life satisfaction, domain 2—physical and mental health, domain 3—meaning and purpose, domain 4—character and virtue, domain 5—close social relationships, and domain 6—health behavior. Furthermore, 10 items from the Human Flourishing Index were included in domains 1-5, with 2 items for each domain. Overall flourishing was defined as the average of the means across these 5 domains. In addition, 7 items related to domains 2, 5, and 6 were assessed. The final sample consisted of 2504 participants aged 65 years or older, with questionnaires containing the Human Flourishing Index randomly distributed to approximately half of the respondents (submodule: n = 1243). Consequently, we used 2 datasets for analysis. We applied targeted maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the population average treatment effects, with Bonferroni correction used to adjust for multiple testing. Results: Digital gaming was not significantly associated with overall flourishing or with any of the 5 domains from the Human Flourishing Index. Although initial analyses indicated associations between digital gaming and participation in hobby groups (mean difference = 0.12, P = .005) as well as meeting with friends (mean difference = 0.076, P = .02), these associations did not remain significant after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition, digital gaming was not associated with increased sedentary behavior or reduced outdoor activities. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the impact of digital gaming on the health and well-being of older adults in a real-world context. Although digital gaming did not show a significant association with improvements in flourishing or in the individual items across the 5 domains, it was also not associated with increased sedentary behavior or reduced outdoor activities. These findings suggest that digital gaming can be part of a balanced lifestyle for older adults, offering opportunities for social engagement, particularly through hobby groups. Considering the solitary nature of gaming, promoting social gaming opportunities may be a promising approach to enhance the positive effects of digital gaming on well-being.

A previous phase I trial of Overcome Death Anxiety (ODA), a novel online stand-alone psychological intervention to reduce death anxiety, demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy and acceptability in a clinical population. However, this trial was limited by a small sample size (n=20). Aims: To further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in reducing death anxiety in a clinical population, compared with a waitlist control. Method: This paper describes the protocol of a phase II randomized controlled, unblinded trial of ODA. A total sample of 256 adults living in Australia, diagnosed with an anxiety-related condition, will be recruited. These participants will be randomised to ODA or a waitlist control. Primary outcomes will be measured as changes in scores on death anxiety questionnaires, reflecting treatment efficacy. The secondary outcomes to be measured are depression, anxiety, stress, suicidality, insomnia, and meaning of life, as well as feedback about treatment program acceptability. This trial will assess the efficacy of ODA for reducing death anxiety in a population diagnosed with various anxiety-related conditions, as well as the overall acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. Conclusions: This study will provide evidence to evaluate the efficacy of ODA in people diagnosed with an anxiety-related condition.

Nevertheless, the longitudinal links between mental health indicators are rarely studied in intervention research. Therefore, it is unknown how the intervention effects are sustained. Aim: The current study investigated mechanisms explaining sustained intervention effects in a sample of medical nurses who receive a CBT-based internet-delivered stress recovery program. Method: A single-group longitudinal study design with three measurement points, pre-test, post-test, and 3-month follow-up, was used in the current study. The sample consisted of nurses and assistant nurses from Lithuania (n=111, age: M (SD) = 41.69 years (10.85)) who had participated in a 6-week CBT internet intervention targeting stress recovery. Data were collected as the randomised control trial, the treatment samples were combined, and the data were analysed using cross-lagged panel analysis with four variables representing the psychological well-being and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Results: The results revealed that decreased anxiety and increased psychological well-being at post-test predicted reduced stress levels at the 3-month follow-up. In addition, decreased anxiety at post-test predicted decreased depression at follow-up. Conclusions: Decreased anxiety and increased well-being could explain the sustainability of reduced stress following a CBT-based internet intervention for nurses. The implications of this for research and practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Internet-based grief interventions may help fill this gap, but such programmes have not yet been developed or evaluated in China. The proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of an online self-help intervention programme named Healing Grief for bereaved Chinese with prolonged grief, and to explore the psychological mechanisms of potential improvements. Methods: We designed a two-arm randomised controlled trial. At least 128 participants will be randomly assigned to either an Internet-based intervention group or a waitlist-control group. The Internet-based intervention will be developed based on the dual process model, integrating techniques of psychoeducation, behavioural activation, cognitive reappraisal, and meaning reconstruction, and will be delivered via expressive writing. The intervention comprises six modules, with two sessions in each module, and requires participants to complete two sessions per week and complete the intervention in 6 weeks. The primary outcomes include effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility. The effectiveness will be assessed by measures of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Acceptability and feasibility will be evaluated using survey and interview on user experience characteristics. Secondary outcomes include moderators and mediators, such as dual process coping, grief rumination, mindfulness, and continuing bond, to explore the psychological mechanisms of potential improvement. Assessments will take place at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Conclusion: The proposed study will determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of the newly developed online self-help intervention for bereaved Chinese with prolonged grief and clarify how the intervention helps with symptom improvements. Such an intervention may play an important role in easing the imbalance between the delivery and receipt of bereavement psychological services in China.

10.1038/s41380-024-02564-y,Improved implicit self-esteem is associated with extended antidepressant effects following a novel synergistic intervention,"Eken, H. Nur;Spotts, Crystal;Panny, Benjamin;Griffo, Angela;Degutis, Michelle;Cruz, Nicolas;Bell, Elizabeth;Do-Nguyen, Kevin;Wallace, Meredith L.;Mathew, Sanjay J.;Howland, Robert H.;Price, Rebecca B.",Molecular Psychiatry,,2023.9.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: In a previously published randomized controlled trial, automated self-association training (ASAT), a novel digital intervention, was found to extend the rapid antidepressant effect of a single infusion of ketamine for at least 30 days. In this secondary analysis, we aimed to understand the potential role of implicit self-esteem in the combined antidepressant effect of ketamine and ASAT training, by investigating the novel synergistic treatment’s effects on implicit self-associations and their relation to symptom improvement. Methods: A total of 154 adults (ages 18–60) with treatment-resistant unipolar depression and lower-than-normative explicit self-esteem were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-arm design to receive one of three treatment allocations: an active/active treatment combination consisting of one infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) followed by four days of ASAT ( ~ 30–40 min/day), or one of two control arms that lacked either the active drug or the active behavioral component. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was used to behaviorally assess the strength of association between self-related stimuli and negative concepts. Linear regression models were used to test the relationship between group assignment, IAT scores acquired immediately post-treatment, and both acute and extended clinical outcomes (% change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores, relative to pre-treatment baseline) in the trial. Results: The group assigned to ketamine + ASAT intervention, compared to the other groups, had a pattern of IAT scores indicating more positive self-associations immediately after treatment relative to the control arms (F(1, 131) = 3.979; p = 0.048). In regression models, IAT scores tracked with concurrent (acute post-treatment) % change in MADRS scores across all treatment arms ( p = 0.001), and mediated more extended (Day 30) depression improvements specifically for the ketamine+ASAT arm (group * IAT interaction term: β = –0.201; p = 0.049). Discussion: Our findings suggest that changing implicit self-worth during a post-ketamine ‘plasticity window’ is one key mechanism whereby the novel ketamine+ASAT treatment combination exerts its antidepressant benefit, confirming the intended treatment target at the level of implicit cognition. Future studies should seek to further enhance the reliability of the biobehavioral intervention’s impact on implicit cognition, as this mechanism appears linked to the intervention’s enduring clinical benefits.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2024-61111-001). Measurement-based peer supervision is one strategy to assure the quality of psychological treatments delivered by non-mental health specialist providers. In this formative study, we aimed to 1) describe the development and 2) examine the acceptability and feasibility of PEERS (Promoting Effective mental healthcare through peER Supervision)—a novel smartphone app that aims to facilitate registering and scheduling patients, collecting patient outcomes, rating therapy quality and assessing supervision quality—among frontline treatment providers delivering behavioral activation treatment for depression. The PEERS prototype was developed and tested in 2021, and version 1 was launched in 2022. To date, 215 treatment providers (98% female; ages 30–35) in Madhya Pradesh and Goa, India, have been trained to use PEERS and 65.58% have completed the supplemental, virtual PEERS course. Focus group discussions with 98 providers were examined according to four themes—training and education, app effectiveness, user experience and adherence and data privacy and safety. This yielded commonly endorsed facilitators (e.g., collaborative learning through group supervision, the convenience of consolidated patient data), barriers (e.g., difficulties with new technologies) and suggested changes (e.g., esthetic improvements, suicide risk assessment prompt). The PEERS app has the potential to scale measurement-based peer supervision to facilitate quality assurance of psychological treatments across contexts.

We know little about how they journey through these services, or whether healthcare providers collect sufficient data to accurately appraise this. We aimed to summarise the child and adolescent depression pathway for two healthcare providers. This cohort study used de-identified electronic health records extracted from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM). We identified referrals between 2015 and 2019 during which the referred patient received their first depression diagnosis aged &lt; 18 years. We described patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and features of the referral. In total, n = 296 (CPFT) and n = 2502 (SLaM) patients had a referral which met eligibility criteria. In both sites, patients were more frequently female (CPFT 79.3%; SLaM 69.3%) and White ethnicity (CPFT 88.9%; SLaM 57.9%) as compared to respective population estimates for the Trusts’ catchment areas. Patients typically received their first depression diagnosis during adolescence (median ages 16 in CPFT and 15 in SLaM). The most common comorbidity was anxiety disorder. Referrals were usually routine, to community teams specialising in the child age group. Commonly mentioned interventions included antidepressant medication, cognitive behavioural therapy, and dialectical behaviour therapy. However, pathways varied within and between sites, and the quality and consistency of some data was poor. These findings provide an overview of service pathways experienced by children and adolescents with depression, but also highlight that pathways can vary according to individual need and healthcare provider. More systematic collection of some data, and standardisation in record systems used by different providers, would be beneficial.

This randomized controlled trial (NCT No. 04361045) examined the effectiveness of such a prevention program. Method: StriveWeekly is a web-based intervention designed with weekly self-guided skill modules (e.g., behavioral activation) that are synchronously delivered to all users. Student participants ( n = 1,607) were recruited from one large public university, and 65.4% had no prior mental health service use. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of StriveWeekly ( n = 804) or a waitlist condition ( n = 803). Participants completed web-based surveys at baseline, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was the self-reported Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale–21. Results: Piecewise linear mixed-effect models found significant group by time interactions for depression ( t = −3.05, p = .002), anxiety ( t = −3.01, p = .003), and total symptoms ( t = −3.34, p &lt; .001). Relative to the waitlist, students assigned to StriveWeekly improved more from baseline to posttest (between-group d = 0.18–0.21). These small effects were maintained through follow-up, and subsequently replicated by the original waitlist. The intervention was initiated by 73.0% of students in the StriveWeekly condition (modules completed: M = 3.72), and 71.6% of all posttest respondents rated the intervention highly. Conclusion: Findings supported StriveWeekly’s effectiveness for large scale indicated prevention of anxiety and depression symptoms in university students. However, further development and research are still needed, as not all students used the intervention, reported satisfaction, or experienced improvement.

10.1111/acer.15209,Effects of a digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia on sleep and alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers: A randomized pilot study,"Verlinden, Justin J.;Moloney, Mairead E.;Vsevolozhskaya, Olga A.;Ritterband, Lee M.;Winkel, Fiona;Weafer, Jessica",Alcohol: Clinical and Experimental Research,,2023.5.10,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Insomnia is a well-established, prospective risk factor for Alcohol Use Disorder. Thus, targeting sleep problems could serve as a novel and efficacious means of reducing problematic drinking. Here, we examined the potential utility of a well-validated, interactive, easy to use, self-paced digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia program. In a randomized, single-blind pilot study, we examined the impact of treatment with Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) on drinking and sleep outcomes in a sample of heavy drinkers with insomnia. Methods: Heavy drinking men ( n = 28) and women ( n = 42) with insomnia were randomly assigned to complete either the SHUTi program or a control patient education program. Subjective measures of sleep and alcohol use were administered at baseline, immediately following completion of the intervention, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Sleep outcomes were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Drinking outcomes were assessed using the 30-Day Timeline Follow-Back calendar. We used linear mixed effects models to compare groups on both insomnia and drinking outcomes. Results: Data from all 70 subjects (SHUTI: n = 40; control: n = 30) were analyzed. Linear mixed effects models showed that SHUTi significantly reduced insomnia symptoms ( p = 0.01) and drinking outcomes ( ps &lt; 0.05) more than the control condition over time. Trend-level effects on sleep quality ( p = 0.06) were also observed. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Improving sleep may be an effective treatment intervention for reducing hazardous drinking in at-risk individuals. Further, findings provide preliminary support for the implementation of an easily accessible health behavior intervention with significant public health impact in a high-risk population.

Accessible interventions for HCWs are needed to reduce distress during the pandemic. Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of a brief psychological intervention (RECHARGE) delivered by videoconferencing to reduce psychological distress in HCWs. Method: This single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial enrolled HCWs in Switzerland who screened positive for psychological distress. Participants were randomly allocated to RECHARGE, that taught behavioral strategies or active treatment as usual (ATAU). Primary outcome was the total score on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) measured at baseline, post-intervention, 2-month (primary outcome time point), and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included worry, anxiety and depression, burnout, traumatic stress, moral injury distress, and work performance. Results: Between August 2020 and May 2021, 160 HCWs were enrolled in the study (RECHARGE = 82, ATAU = 78). Relative to ATAU, at 2 months RECHARGE led to a greater reduction in psychological distress (mean difference = 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI .28, .34], p = .02; effect size = .37), and greater reductions in worry, burnout, and moral injury distress. These effects were not maintained at 6 months. Conclusions: This trial provides initial evidence that a brief psychological intervention delivered via videoconferencing results in significant reductions in mental health problems arising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Booster sessions or digital tools may be needed to maintain the initial gains achieved by RECHARGE. This intervention may have utility in improving the mental health of HCWs both during pandemics and everyday stressors.

Longitudinal linear mixed-effects models for repeated measures were used to identify variables with significant influence on the rate of improvement in the main treatment outcome pain interference from pre- to post-treatment. The variables were sorted into six domains (demographics, pain variables, psychological flexibility, baseline severity, comorbid symptoms and early adherence) and analysed in a stepwise manner. The study found that shorter pain duration and higher degree of insomnia symptoms at baseline predicted larger treatment effects.

Given the lack of at-scale community-based interventions promoting resistance training, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of an innovative mHealth intervention on upper- and lower-body muscular fitness, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, and social-cognitive mediators among a sample of community-dwelling adults. Study design: Researchers evaluated the community-based ecofit intervention using a cluster RCT from September 2019 to March 2022 in 2 regional municipalities of New South Wales, Australia. Setting/participants: Researchers recruited a sample of 245 participants (72% female, aged 53.4 ± 13.9 years) who were randomized to the ecofit intervention group ( n = 122) or waitlist control ( n = 123) group. Intervention: The intervention group received access to a smartphone application with standardized workouts tailored to 12 outdoor gym locations and an introductory session. Participants were encouraged to perform at least 2 ecofit workouts per week. Main outcome measures: Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. The coprimary muscular fitness outcomes were evaluated using the 90-degree push-up and the 60-second sit-to-stand test. Intervention effects were estimated using linear mixed models accounting for group-level clustering (participants could enroll in groups of up to 4). Statistical analysis was conducted in April 2022. Results: Statistically significant improvements were observed in upper (1.4 repetitions, 95% CI = 0.3, 2.6, p = 0.018) and lower (2.6 repetitions, 95% CI = 0.4, 4.8, p = 0.020) body muscular fitness at 9 months but not at 3 months. Increases in self-reported resistance training, resistance training self-efficacy, and implementation intention for resistance training were statistically significant at 3 and 9 months. Conclusions: This study has shown that a mHealth intervention promoting resistance training using the built environment can improve muscular fitness, physical activity behavior, and related cognitions in a community sample of adults.

Participants ( N total = 619) were smartphone users in Germany. The first experimental group ( N = 200) waived smartphone use for 7 days, the second experimental group ( N = 226) reduced its daily use by 1 hr, and the control group ( N = 193) used smartphone as usual. Variables of smartphone use (time, intensity, problematic tendencies), life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, physical activity, and smoking behavior were assessed via online surveys at four measurement time points (baseline; postintervention; 1 and 4 months after postintervention). Both interventions reduced smartphone use intensity, problematic use tendencies, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. In both groups, life satisfaction and physical activity increased. Most effects were stronger and remained more stable over 4 months in the reduction group than in the abstinence group. Moreover, in the reduction group only, the number of daily smoked cigarettes decreased. Thus, less time spent on the smartphone leads to more well-being and a healthier lifestyle; a complete smartphone abstinence is not necessary.

10.1080/07448481.2020.1869749,Feasibility of a web-based program for universal prevention of anxiety and depression in university students: An open trial,"Rith-Najarian, Leslie R.;Chorpita, Bruce F.;Gong-Guy, Elizabeth;Hammons, Hayley R.;Chavira, Denise A.",Journal of American College Health,,2020.6.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: To examine the feasibility of a self-guided, Web-based program for universal prevention of anxiety and depression in university students. Participants: University students (n = 651) enrolled in the tested program (March, 2016). Methods: The program delivered eight weeks of mental health skills (e.g., behavioral activation, mindfulness). Data was collected online through an entry survey, weekly check-in surveys, and a post-program feedback survey. Results: Campus-wide recruitment emails were the most encountered recruitment strategy (82%). In terms of adherence, the program was initiated by 73% of students and fully completed by 11% of students. There was some evidence of program acceptability (e.g., 71% of students endorsed the program as “useful”). Common qualitative themes further suggested acceptability for some aspects of the program while also highlighting others for revision. Conclusion: Findings support further development of the online program and recommendations are made for improving the platform before future testing.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.991755,Cognitive behavioral therapy with adaptive virtual reality exposure vs. Cognitive behavioral therapy with<i>in vivo</i> exposure in the treatment of social anxiety disorder: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Ørskov, Per Trads;Lichtenstein, Mia Beck;Ernst, Mathias Torp;Fasterholdt, Iben;Matthiesen, Asge Frederik;Scirea, Marco;Bouchard, Stephane;Andersen, Tonny Elmose",Frontiers in Psychiatry,,2022.7.11,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) has a high prevalence and an early onset with recovery taking decades to occur. Current evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with virtual reality (VR) exposure. However, the evidence is based on a sparse number of studies with predominantly small sample sizes. There is a need for more trials investigating the optimal way of applying VR based exposure for SAD. In this trial, we will test the efficacy of CBT with adaptive VR exposure allowing adjustment of the exposure based on real-time monitoring of the participants's anxiety level. Methods: The trial is a randomized controlled, assessor-blinded, parallel-group superiority trail. The study has two arms: (1) CBT including exposure in vivo (CBT-Exp), (2) CBT including exposure therapy using individually tailored VR-content and a system to track anxiety levels (CBT-ExpVR). Treatment is individual, manual-based and consists of 10 weekly sessions with a duration of 60 min. The study includes 90 participants diagnosed with SAD. Assessments are carried out pre-treatment, mid-treatment and at follow-up (6 and 12 months). The primary outcome is the mean score on the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) with the primary endpoint being post-treatment. Discussion: The study adds to the existing knowledge by assessing the efficacy of CBT with adaptive VR exposure. The study has high methodological rigor using a randomized controlled trial with a large sample size that includes follow-up data and validated measures for social anxiety outcomes.

10.1007/s13178-021-00676-6,Racialized sexual discrimination (RSD) and psychological wellbeing among young sexual minority black men (YSMBM) who seek intimate partners online,"Wade, Ryan M.;Bouris, Alida M.;Neilands, Torsten B.;Harper, Gary W.",Sexuality Research & Social Policy: A Journal of the NSRC,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: Online dating is widespread among young adults, and particularly young sexual minority men. Racialized sexual discrimination (RSD), also known as “sexual racism,” is frequently reported to occur within these digital spaces and may negatively impact the psychological wellbeing of young sexual minority Black men (YSMBM). However, the association between RSD and psychological wellbeing is not well understood.MethodsUsing data (collected between July 2017–January 2018) from a cross-sectional web-survey of YSMBM ( N = 603), six multivariable regression models were estimated to examine the association between five RSD subscales and depressive symptoms and feelings of self-worth. RSD subscales were derived from the first preliminarily validated scale of sexual racism. Results: Analyses revealed that White superiority (β = .10, p &lt; .01), same-race rejection (β = .16, p &lt; .001), and White physical objectification (β = .14, p &lt; .01) were all significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms, and White physical objectification (β = -.11, p &lt; .01) was significantly associated with lower feelings of self-worth. Conclusions: This study is among the first to examine the relationship between multiple, distinct manifestations of RSD and depressive symptoms and self-worth using quantitative analyses and provides evidence that RSD is negatively associated with psychological wellbeing. Policy Implications: Site administrators should institute robust anti-racism policies on their platforms and hold users accountable for discriminatory behavior. Activists may also consider forming coalitions and/or developing campaigns to bring about greater awareness of RSD, in an effort to influence site administrators to enact policy change.

10.2196/33850,Predicting the next-day perceived and physiological stress of pregnant women by using machine learning and explainability: Algorithm development and validation,"Ng, Ada;Wei, Boyang;Jain, Jayalakshmi;Ward, Erin A.;Tandon, S. Darius;Moskowitz, Judith T.;Krogh-Jespersen, Sheila;Wakschlag, Lauren S.;Alshurafa, Nabil",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2021.9.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy–based interventions are effective in reducing prenatal stress, which can have severe adverse health effects on mothers and newborns if unaddressed. Predicting next-day physiological or perceived stress can help to inform and enable pre-emptive interventions for a likely physiologically and perceptibly stressful day. Machine learning models are useful tools that can be developed to predict next-day physiological and perceived stress by using data collected from the previous day. Such models can improve our understanding of the specific factors that predict physiological and perceived stress and allow researchers to develop systems that collect selected features for assessment in clinical trials to minimize the burden of data collection. Objective: The aim of this study was to build and evaluate a machine-learned model that predicts next-day physiological and perceived stress by using sensor-based, ecological momentary assessment (EMA)–based, and intervention-based features and to explain the prediction results. Methods: We enrolled pregnant women into a prospective proof-of-concept study and collected electrocardiography, EMA, and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention data over 12 weeks. We used the data to train and evaluate 6 machine learning models to predict next-day physiological and perceived stress. After selecting the best performing model, Shapley Additive Explanations were used to identify the feature importance and explainability of each feature. Results: A total of 16 pregnant women enrolled in the study. Overall, 4157.18 hours of data were collected, and participants answered 2838 EMAs. After applying feature selection, 8 and 10 features were found to positively predict next-day physiological and perceived stress, respectively. A random forest classifier performed the best in predicting next-day physiological stress (F1 score of 0.84) and next-day perceived stress (F1 score of 0.74) by using all features. Although any subset of sensor-based, EMA-based, or intervention-based features could reliably predict next-day physiological stress, EMA-based features were necessary to predict next-day perceived stress. The analysis of explainability metrics showed that the prolonged duration of physiological stress was highly predictive of next-day physiological stress and that physiological stress and perceived stress were temporally divergent. Conclusions: In this study, we were able to build interpretable machine learning models to predict next-day physiological and perceived stress, and we identified unique features that were highly predictive of next-day stress that can help to reduce the burden of data collection.

10.1017/S0033291720003426,Efficacy of a transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral intervention for eating disorder psychopathology delivered through a smartphone app: A randomized controlled trial,"Linardon, Jake;Shatte, Adrian;Rosato, John;Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Matthew",Psychological Medicine,,2020.6.28,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Although effective treatments exist for diagnostic and subthreshold-level eating disorders (EDs), a significant proportion of affected individuals do not receive help. Interventions translated for delivery through smartphone apps may be one solution towards reducing this treatment gap. However, evidence for the efficacy of smartphones apps for EDs is lacking. We developed a smartphone app based on the principles and techniques of transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for EDs and evaluated it through a pre-registered randomized controlled trial. Methods: Symptomatic individuals (those who reported the presence of binge eating) were randomly assigned to the app ( n = 197) or waiting list ( n = 195). Of the total sample, 42 and 31% exhibited diagnostic-level bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder symptoms, respectively. Assessments took place at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks post-randomization. Analyses were intention-to-treat. The primary outcome was global levels of ED psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were other ED symptoms, impairment, and distress. Results: Intervention participants reported greater reductions in global ED psychopathology than the control group at post-test ( d = −0.80). Significant effects were also observed for secondary outcomes ( d 's = −0.30 to −0.74), except compensatory behavior frequency. Symptom levels remained stable at follow-up. Participants were largely satisfied with the app, although the overall post-test attrition rate was 35%. Conclusion: Findings highlight the potential for this app to serve as a cost-effective and easily accessible intervention for those who cannot receive standard treatment. The capacity for apps to be flexibly integrated within current models of mental health care delivery may prove vital for addressing the unmet needs of people with EDs.

10.1097/HTR.0000000000000770,Development of RehaBot—A conversational agent for promoting rewarding activities in users with traumatic brain injury,"Rabinowitz, Amanda R.;Collier, George;Vaccaro, Monica;Wingfield, Roberto",The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: In this article, we describe the development and preliminary testing of RehaBot—a chatbot that users communicate with via text messaging designed to augment behavioral activation (BA) treatment of reducing depression and increasing participation in individuals with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Setting: Outpatient brain injury rehabilitation facility. Participants: Outpatient brain injury clinicians and individuals with moderate to severe TBI. Design: Focus groups, software demonstration trials, and single-case experiments with an A-B-A design. Main Measures: System Usability Scale (SUS) and self-reported completed target activities. Results: Focus group feedback guided the development of a flexible system to be used in conjunction with face-to-face therapy, designed to provide reminders, encouragement, and supportive feedback. Two of 3 participants completed all 6 RehaBot tasks independently. One completed 4 tasks independently and a fifth with assistance. Average SUS score in demonstration trials was 76.77 (SD = 21.19). In 4 single-case experiments, participants completed their highest proportion of planned activities in the RehaBot phase and the lowest proportion of planned activities in the reversal phase. They all interacted with RehaBot daily, exchanging an average of 225 messages over the 1-week period, and average SUS score was 95 (SD = 4.74). Their open-ended feedback revealed that participants found RehaBot enjoyable and easy to use. They felt it was a helpful memory aid and promoted better adherence to planned activities by providing accountability and positive reinforcement. Conclusions: This article presents a chatbot development process heavily involving consumer input, which may serve as a model for future development efforts. Our findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting that RehaBot is usable and may promote better adherence to planned target activities. However, future research is needed to establish usability and efficacy of RehaBot and to explore applications of chatbots to other domains of TBI rehabilitation.

10.1007/s10608-021-10272-y,Transdiagnostic processes as mediators of change in an internet-delivered intervention based on the unified protocol,"Schaeuffele, Carmen;Bär, Jonathan;Buengener, Inken;Grafiadeli, Raphaela;Heuthaler, Eva;Strieder, Judith;Ziehn, Patricia;Knaevelsrud, Christine;Renneberg, Babette;Boettcher, Johanna",Cognitive Therapy and Research,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Transdiagnostic treatments target shared mechanisms between disorders to facilitate change across diagnoses. The Unified Protocol (UP) aims at changing dysfunctional reactions towards emotions by increasing mindful emotion awareness and cognitive flexibility, as well as decreasing anxiety sensitivity and emotion avoidance. Method: We investigated whether these transdiagnostic processes were malleable by treatment and mediated the relationship between treatment and outcome in an internet-delivered adaptation of the UP. N = 129 participants with mixed anxiety, depressive, and somatic symptom disorders were randomized to treatment or waitlist. Results: The treatment yielded significant changes in all transdiagnostic processes over time in comparison to a waitlist condition. In separate mediator models, significant mediating effects were found for mindfulness, cognitive flexibility, behavioral activation, and experiential avoidance. When all mediators were combined in a multiple mediator model, the indirect effects through mindfulness and cognitive flexibility emerged as significant. Conclusion: These findings add to the growing body of research on transdiagnostic processes as mediators of change and emphasize mindfulness and cognitive flexibility as a transdiagnostic treatment target. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously, as temporal precedence could not be established. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.2196/31018,"Web-based interventions to help Australian adults address depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and general mental well-being: Scoping review","Skaczkowski, Gemma;van der Kruk, Shannen;Loxton, Sophie;Hughes-Barton, Donna;Howell, Cate;Turnbull, Deborah;Jensen, Neil;Smout, Matthew;Gunn, Kate",JMIR Mental Health,,2021.6.7,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: A large number of Australians experience mental health challenges at some point in their lives. However, in many parts of Australia, the wait times to see general practitioners and mental health professionals can be lengthy. With increasing internet use across Australia, web-based interventions may help increase access to timely mental health care. As a result, this is an area of increasing research interest, and the number of publicly available web-based interventions is growing. However, it can be confusing for clinicians and consumers to know the resources that are evidence-based and best meet their needs. Objective: This study aims to scope out the range of web-based mental health interventions that address depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or general mental well-being and are freely available to Australian adults, along with their impact, acceptability, therapeutic approach, and key features. Methods: The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR [PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews]) guided the review process. Keywords for the search were depression, anxiety, suicide, and well-being. The search was conducted using Google as well as the key intervention databases Beacon, Head to Health, and e-Mental Health in Practice. Interventions were deemed eligible if they targeted depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, or general mental well-being (eg, resilience) in adults; and were web-based, written in English, interactive, free, and publicly available. They also had to be guided by an evidence-based therapeutic approach. Results: Overall, 52 eligible programs were identified, of which 9 (17%) addressed depression, 15 (29%) addressed anxiety, 13 (25%) addressed general mental well-being, and 13 (25%) addressed multiple issues. Only 4% (2/52) addressed distress in the form of suicidal ideation. The most common therapeutic approach was cognitive behavioral therapy. Half of the programs guided users through exercises in a set sequence, and most programs enabled users to log in and complete the activities on their own without professional support. Just over half of the programs had been evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing symptoms, and 11% (6/52) were being evaluated at the time of writing. Program evaluation scores ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total average score of 85%. Conclusions: There are numerous web-based programs for depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and general well-being, which are freely and publicly available in Australia. However, identified gaps include a lack of available web-based interventions for culturally and linguistically diverse populations and programs that use newer therapeutic approaches such as acceptance and commitment therapy and dialectical behavior therapy. Despite most programs included in this review being of good quality, clinicians and consumers should pay careful attention when selecting which program to recommend and use, as variations in the levels of acceptability and impact of publicly available programs do exist.

10.2196/28647,Behavioral and self-reported data collected from smartphones for the assessment of depressive and manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder: Prospective observational study,"Dominiak, Monika;Kaczmarek-Majer, Katarzyna;Antosik-Wójcińska, Anna Z.;Opara, Karol R.;Olwert, Anna;Radziszewska, Weronika;Hryniewicz, Olgierd;Święcicki, Łukasz;Wojnar, Marcin;Mierzejewski, Paweł",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2021.3.14,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Smartphones allow for real-time monitoring of patients’ behavioral activities in a naturalistic setting. These data are suggested as markers for the mental state of patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Objective: We assessed the relations between data collected from smartphones and the clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms together with the corresponding affective states in patients with BD. Methods: BDmon, a dedicated mobile app, was developed and installed on patients’smartphones to automatically collect the statistics about their phone calls and text messages as well as their self-assessments of sleep and mood. The final sample for the numerical analyses consisted of 51 eligible patients who participated in at least two psychiatric assessments and used the BDmon app (mean participation time, 208 [SD 132] days). In total, 196 psychiatric assessments were performed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to quantify the strength of the relation between the daily statistics on the behavioral data collected automatically from smartphones and the affective symptoms and mood states in patients with BD. Results: Objective behavioral data collected from smartphones were found to be related with the BD states as follows: (1) depressed patients tended to make phone calls less frequently than euthymic patients (β = −.064, P = .01); (2) the number of incoming answered calls during depression was lower than that during euthymia (β = −.15, P = .01) and, concurrently, missed incoming calls were more frequent and increased as depressive symptoms intensified (β = 4.431, P &lt; .001; β = 4.861, P &lt; .001, respectively); (3) the fraction of outgoing calls was higher in manic states (β = 2.73, P = .03); (4) the fraction of missed calls was higher in manic/mixed states as compared to that in the euthymic state (β = 3.53, P = .01) and positively correlated to the severity of symptoms (β = 2.991, P = .02); (5) the variability of the duration of the outgoing calls was higher in manic/mixed states (β = .0012, P = .045) and positively correlated to the severity of symptoms (β = .0017, P = .02); and (6) the number and length of the sent text messages was higher in manic/mixed states as compared to that in the euthymic state (β = .031, P = .01; β = .015, P = .01; respectively) and positively correlated to the severity of manic symptoms (β = .116, P &lt; .001; β = .022, P &lt; .001; respectively). We also observed that self-assessment of mood was lower in depressive (β = −1.452, P &lt; .001) and higher in manic states (β = .509, P &lt; .001). Conclusions: Smartphone-based behavioral parameters are valid markers for assessing the severity of affective symptoms and discriminating between mood states in patients with BD. This technology opens a way toward early detection of worsening of the mental state and thereby increases the patient’s chance of improving in the course of the illness.

10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.102002,Promoting physical activity during the COVID-19 lockdown in Australia: The roles of psychological predictors and commercial physical activity apps,"Petersen, Jasmine M.;Kemps, Eva;Lewis, Lucy K.;Prichard, Ivanka",Psychology of Sport and Exercise,,2020.12.8,Scholarly Journals,English,"Purpose: Physical activity confers many physical and mental health benefits. Thus, it is of great concern that the COVID-19 lockdown has adversely impacted engagement in physical activity. There is a need to understand the factors linked to physical activity during COVID-19 as this will be fundamental to the development of innovative approaches to support engagement in physical activity during a pandemic. This study aimed to ascertain the psychological and mental health predictors of physical activity during the COVID-19 lockdown. We also examined the value of harnessing commercial physical activity apps to facilitate physical activity during a pandemic. Method: A nationwide online survey was completed by 408 Australian adults (Mage = 35.7 ± 13.9 years, 86.0% female) following the initial COVID-19 lockdown (April/May 2020). The survey incorporated measures that retrospectively assessed physical activity (and perceived changes in physical activity behaviour), psychological constructs (social support, self-efficacy, self-determined motivations), mental health, and engagement with commercial physical activity apps during the lockdown. Results: Over half of participants (53.4%) reported a reduction in physical activity during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, with markedly fewer (23.8%) reporting an increase in physical activity. App use (β = .09, p = .027), social support (β = .10, p = .021), self-efficacy (β = .42, p &lt; .001), and identified regulation (β = .25, p &lt; .001) emerged as important predictors of physical activity engagement (min/week). Self-efficacy (OR = 4.2, p &lt; .001) was also associated with a greater likelihood of perceived positive changes (increases) in physical activity. The relationship between app use and physical activity was mediated by self-efficacy (β = 0.10 [0.06, 0.15]) and identified regulation (β = 0.09 [0.04, 0.15]); self-efficacy (β = 0.15, [0.09, 0.21]) also mediated the relationship between app use and positive changes in physical activity. Conclusions: It is imperative that interventions targeted at increasing social support, self-efficacy, and autonomous motivations are developed and utilised to support engagement in physical activity during a pandemic. Commercial physical activity apps demonstrate the potential to mitigate reductions in physical activity during a pandemic, and thus the use of these apps should be encouraged.

The present pilot study in young patients with newly diagnosed BD and healthy controls (HC) aimed to (1) validate automatically generated smartphone data reflecting physical and social activity and phone usage against validated clinical rating scales and questionnaires; (2) investigate differences in automatically generated smartphone data between young patients with newly diagnosed BD and HC; and (3) investigate associations between automatically generated smartphone data and smartphone-based self-monitored mood and activity in young patients with newly diagnosed BD. Methods: A total of 40 young patients with newly diagnosed BD and 21 HC aged 15–25 years provided daily automatically generated smartphone data for 3–779 days [median (IQR) = 140 (11.5–268.5)], in addition to daily smartphone-based self-monitoring of activity and mood. All participants were assessed with clinical rating scales. Results: (1) The number of outgoing phone calls was positively associated with scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale and subitems concerning activity and speech. The number of missed calls ( p = 0.015) and the number of outgoing text messages ( p = 0.017) were positively associated with the level of psychomotor agitation according to the Hamilton Depression Rating scale subitem 9. (2) Young patients with newly diagnosed BD had a higher number of incoming calls compared with HC (BD: mean = 1.419, 95% CI: 1.162, 1.677; HC: mean = 0.972, 95% CI: 0.637, 1.308; p = 0.043) and lower self-monitored mood and activity ( p 's &lt; 0.001). (3) Smartphone-based self-monitored mood and activity were positively associated with step counts and the number of outgoing calls, respectively ( p 's &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Automatically generated data on physical and social activity and phone usage seem to reflect symptoms. These data differ between young patients with newly diagnosed BD and HC and reflect changes in illness activity in young patients with BD. Automatically generated smartphone-based data could be a useful clinical tool in diagnosing and monitoring illness activity in young patients with BD.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established evidence-based treatment for SAD, but its availability is limited. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for SAD in youths vs an active comparator, internet-delivered supportive therapy (ISUPPORT). Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-masked, superiority randomized clinical trial enrolled participants at a clinical research unit integrated within the child and adolescent mental health services in Stockholm, Sweden, from September 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018. The final participant reached the 3-month follow-up (primary end point) in May 2019. Children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with a principal diagnosis of SAD and their parents were included in the study. Interventions: ICBT and ISUPPORT, both including 10 online modules, 5 separate parental modules, and 3 video call sessions with a therapist. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Clinician Severity Rating (CSR), derived from the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule, rated by masked assessors 3 months after the end of treatment. The CSR ranges from0to 8, with scores of 4 or higher indicating caseness. Secondary outcomes included masked assessor–rated diagnostic status of SAD and global functioning, child- and parent-reported social anxiety and depressive symptoms, and health-related costs. Results: Of the 307 youths assessed for eligibility, 103 were randomized to 10 weeks of therapist-guided ICBT ( n = 51) or therapist-guided ISUPPORT (n = 52) for SAD. The sample consisted of 103 youths (mean [SD] age, 14.1 [2.1] years; 79 [77%] female). Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was significantly more efficacious than ISUPPORT in reducing the severity of SAD symptoms. Mean (SD) CSR scores for ICBT at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up were 5.06 (0.95) and 3.96 (1.46), respectively, compared with 4.94 (0.94) and 4.48 (1.30) for ISUPPORT. There was a significant between-group effect size of d = 0.67 (95%CI, 0.21-1.12) at the 3-month follow-up. Similarly, all of the secondary outcome measures demonstrated significant differences with small to large effect sizes, except for child-rated quality of life (non-significant). The cost-effectiveness analyses indicated cost savings associated with ICBT compared with ISUPPORT, with the main drivers of the savings being lower medication costs ( z = 2.38, P = .02) and increased school productivity ( z = 1.99, P = .047) in the ICBT group. There was 1 suicide attempt in the ISUPPORT group; no other serious adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was an efficacious and cost-effective intervention for children and adolescents with SAD. Implementation in clinical practice could markedly increase the availability of effective interventions for SAD.

10.3389/fpsyg.2021.702565,Evaluating delivery of a CBT-based group intervention for schoolchildren with emotional problems: Examining the reliability and applicability of a video-based adherence and competence measure,"Rasmussen, Lene-Mari Potulski;Patras, Joshua;Handegård, Bjørn Helge;Neumer, Simon-Peter;Martinsen, Kristin Dagmar;Adolfsen, Frode;Sund, Anne Mari;Martinussen, Monica",Frontiers in Psychology,,2021.4.29,Scholarly Journals,English,"Adherence and competence are essential parts of program fidelity and having adequate measures to assess these constructs is important. The Competence and Adherence Scale for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CAS CBT) was developed to evaluate the delivery of cognitive therapies for children with clinical anxiety. The present study is an assessment of the slightly adapted version of the CAS CBT evaluating the delivery of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based preventive group intervention: EMOTION: Kids Coping with Anxiety and Depression. This study was part of a Norwegian cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) investigating the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic intervention, the EMOTION program—an indicated prevention program targeting anxious and depressive symptoms. The applicability and psychometric properties of the CAS CBT were explored. Results are based on six raters evaluating 239 video-recorded sessions of the EMOTION program being delivered by 68 trained group leaders from different municipal services. Interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC [3, 1]) indicated fair to good agreement between raters. Internal consistency of the instrument's key domains was calculated using the Omega coefficient which ranged between 0.70 to 0.94. There was a strong association between the two scales Adherence and Competence, and inter-item correlations were high across the items, except for the items rating the adherence to the session goals. Competence and Adherence Scale for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a brief measure for use in first-line services, with some promising features for easily assessing program fidelity, but some of the results indicated that the instrument should be improved. Future attention should also be made to adapt the instrument to fit better within a group setting, especially regarding evaluation of session goals.

10.1007/s11469-019-00094-1,Internet-based behavioral activation program for depression and problem gambling: Lessons learned from stakeholder interviews,"Cowie, Megan E.;Huguet, Anna;Moore, Craig;McGrath, Patrick J.;Rao, Sanjay;Wozney, Lori;Kits, Olga;Stewart, Sherry H.",International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Behavioral activation (BA) is a well-established treatment for depression, often used as an adjuvant for gambling disorder. Internet-based BA programs exist and are easily accessible. However, many neglect to report program evaluations. DoNamic is an Internet-based BA program for individuals aged 14–40 years with depression and those with comorbid depression and problem gambling. We evaluated DoNamic in a pre-implementation context through interviews with 15 care providers and health care decision-makers (“stakeholders”) to guide improvements to enhance uptake. Stakeholders were interviewed regarding content, design, and implementation. Stakeholders believed DoNamic’s self-guided nature offered a unique means of enhancing access to care. Concerns with DoNamic involved its design, anonymity, and the language used within DoNamic. Suggestions included a brighter design, enhanced anonymity, and modifying language to enhance reach. Lastly, robust evaluations were deemed necessary to sustain DoNamic in certain settings. Stakeholder feedback informed integral changes to DoNamic, potentially enhancing uptake within the health system.

Methods: This analysis used data pooled from two studies: Synergy and Refresh. Synergy: Physically inactive adults (18–65 years) who reported poor sleep quality were recruited for a two-arm Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) (Physical Activity and Sleep Health (PAS; n = 80), or Wait-list Control (CON; n = 80) groups). Refresh: Physically inactive adults (40–65 years) who reported poor sleep quality were recruited for a three-arm RCT (PAS ( n = 110), Sleep Health-Only (SO; n = 110) or CON ( n = 55) groups). The SO group was omitted from this study. The PAS groups received a pedometer, and accessed a smartphone/tablet “app” using behaviour change strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, goal setting, action planning), with additional email/SMS support. The ASI score comprised self-reported moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity, resistance training, sitting time, sleep duration, efficiency, quality and timing. Outcomes were assessed using DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, stress), SF-12 (QOL-physical, QOLmental) and SF-36 (Energy &amp; Fatigue). Assessments were conducted at baseline, 3 months (primary time-point), and 6 months. Mediation effects were examined using Structural Equation Modelling and the product of coefficients approach (AB), with significance set at 0.05. Results: At 3 months there were no direct intervention effects on mental health, QOL or energy and fatigue (all p &gt; 0.05), and the intervention significantly improved the ASI (all p &lt; 0.05). A more favourable ASI score was associated with improved symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, QOL-mental and of energy and fatigue (all p &lt; 0.05). The intervention effects on symptoms of depression ([AB; 95%CI] -0.31; − 0.60,-0.11), anxiety (− 0.11; − 0.27,-0.01), stress (− 0.37; − 0.65,-0.174), QOL-mental (0.53; 0.22, 1.01) and ratings of energy and fatigue (0.85; 0.33, 1.63) were mediated by ASI. At 6 months the magnitude of association was larger although the overall pattern of results remained similar. Conclusions: Improvements in the overall physical activity and sleep behaviours of adults partially mediated the intervention effects on mental health and quality of life outcomes. This highlights the potential benefit of improving the overall pattern of physical activity and sleep on these outcomes.

10.1016/j.parkreldis.2020.11.015,Cognitive impairment and sedentary behavior predict health-related attrition in a prospective longitudinal Parkinson's disease study,"Sulzer, Patricia;Gräber, Susanne;Schaeffer, Eva;van Lummel, Rob;Berg, Daniela;Maetzler, Walter;Liepelt-Scarfone, Inga",Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,,2020.1.20,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: In Parkinson's disease (PD), the high burden of motor and non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment or falls, is associated with rapid disease progression and mortality. This is often reflected by an increased drop-out rate of PD patients in longitudinal studies. Active physical behavior can impact the disease course beneficially and has an overall positive effect on health. Contrarily, sedentary behavior is associated with cognitive impairment in PD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sedentary physical behavior assessed in the home environment and cognitive impairment can predict health-related study attrition due to sickness and death in PD. Methods: Data of 45 PD patients, longitudinally assessed, were analyzed. Of those, 20 patients completed six yearly visits, 16 dropped out due to sickness or death, and nine for other reasons. All patients wore a mobile device to assess physical behavior and completed cognitive testing. Results: Logistic regression revealed global cognition was the primary predictor for health-related drop-out in varying models ( p ≤ .04). In the survival analysis, cognitive impairment ( p = .005) and longer sedentary mean bout length ( p = .02) were associated with drop-out due to sickness and death. The occurrence of health-related study drop-out or death was highest in patients with both impaired cognition and longer sedentary bouts. Conclusions: Cognition was the primary predictor for study drop-out due to sickness and death. However, it seems that sedentary behavior might have a potential negative influence on PD patients’ health, especially those with cognitive impairment.

The purpose of this study was to pilot the feasibility and acceptability of a technology-assisted CBT intervention in ESRD patients on hemodialysis (HD), share design and implementation lessons learned, and provide preliminary results on changes in select patient-reported symptoms. This was a single-center pilot feasibility study of adult ESRD patients on HD. Study eligibility required clinically elevated levels of at least one symptom (depression, pain, or fatigue). Patients met weekly with a CBT therapist for eight sessions, each 45–60 min, during HD sessions via a video-conferencing platform. Symptom questionnaires were completed at baseline and 3 months follow-up. Of 10 patients screened, 100% screened positive for at least one symptom, 100% of eligible patients consented, and eight (of 10) completed the intervention (mean age 59 years, 50% male, 50% African American). Patient adherence and satisfaction was high, and seven of the eight patients completed all eight prescribed sessions. Minimal interference with HD was reported. Preliminary results indicate no statistically significant changes in depression, fatigue, or pain at follow-up. However, there was small improvement in SF-36 Physical Component score [ t (7) = −2.60, p = .035], and four of the six patients (67%) with clinically elevated pain at baseline reported improvement at follow-up. A technology-assisted CBT intervention for ESRD patients was feasible, well-accepted, and required minimal additional resources in the HD setting. Larger, adequately powered clinical trials are needed to evaluate the effect on ESRD patient-reported outcomes.

The temporal sequence of day-to-day interrelationships between mood and social activity is not well understood, yet could inform targets for cognitive behavioral interventions. The present study examined associations between mood and social activity in real-time through ecological momentary assessments administered via smartphones. In all, 41 outpatients with bipolar disorder were provided with smartphones for 11 weeks and completed twice-daily surveys about affective symptoms and social activity. We assessed the ways in which symptoms at baseline are related to the frequency and type of social interactions in the EMA period. Furthermore, we analyzed the associations between social activity, concurrent and lagged self-ratings of mood state, and momentary positive and negative affect ratings. Participants’ mean (and SD) age was 46.9 (11.8) years, with 53.7% being women. Participants spent an average of 42% of their sampled time alone. The average time spent alone was lower for hypo/manic symptoms (36%) than for depressive symptoms (45%) with euthymic mood intermediate between the two (40%). Positive affect was higher and negative affect (e.g., sadness, anger) was lower during concurrent social interactions. Positive affect was lower during time spent alone, but negative affect did not differ from time spent alone or from other interactions. Lagged models indicated a stronger association between prior social activity and subsequent mood than the converse. Social activity tracked mood polarity over several months. More support was found for social activity influencing mood state compared to the converse. Monitoring social activity may facilitate targeted cognitive behavioral interventions in bipolar disorder.

10.1089/tmj.2018.0088,Heart transplant recipients prefer a telemental health cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention delivered by telephone,"Epstein, Flavio Rose;Liu, Chi-Mei;Stevenson, Janet Marie",Telemedicine and e-Health,,2018.3.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depression and anxiety are common after heart transplant, and in a regional heart transplant center servicing northern California, willingness to participate in treatment can be a major barrier. Introduction: Our primary aim is to design a remote cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention. This study is the first step in the process. Through a survey to the cohort of heart transplant recipients ( N = 230), managed within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Heart Transplant Service, we aimed to assess symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety, patient willingness to participate in a CBT intervention, and preference between video and telephone. We proposed to patients a five-visit intervention, with the first and last visits in person and the three middle visits by video. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty of 230 heart transplant recipients returned the 12-question Likert-like survey. Statistical tests included chi-square, fisher exact test, t -tests, and a logistic regression model. Results: Patients who reported two or more symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety were 5.67 times more likely to engage in a remote CBT intervention (odds ratio = 5.67; 95% confidence interval 1.63–19.78; p = 0.006). Patients experiencing stress with depression were the most willing group to participate in a CBT intervention. The 12 patients who met the study criteria of 3 years post-transplant and experiencing at least one mental health symptom were invited to participate in the CBT intervention. All patients (12) who met the CBT intervention criteria were not willing to participate in the two in-person visits. All were willing to participate in a telephone-only CBT intervention. Discussion: Among the heart transplant recipients in this cohort, there is more willingness to participate in a CBT intervention when distress is higher and there is a preference for telephone visits as the modality for treatment delivery. Conclusions: Based on the findings, the CBT intervention will be shorter in duration; instead of five visits, there will be four visits; and it will be conducted by telephone only. The new intervention will be tested with 8 to 10 patients, changed, and then it will need to be empirically tested.

10.2196/12246,A web-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention to improve social and occupational functioning in adults with type 2 diabetes (The SpringboarD Trial): Randomized controlled trial,"Clarke, Janine;Sanatkar, Samineh;Baldwin, Peter Andrew;Fletcher, Susan;Gunn, Jane;Wilhelm, Kay;Campbell, Lesley;Zwar, Nicholas;Harris, Mark;Lapsley, Helen;Hadzi-Pavlovic, Dusan;Christensen, Helen;Proudfoot, Judy",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2018.9.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depressive symptoms are common in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Effective depression treatments exist; however, access to psychological support is characteristically low. Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is accessible, nonstigmatizing, and may help address substantial personal and public health impact of comorbid T2DM and depression. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the Web-based CBT program, myCompass, for improving social and occupational functioning in adults with T2DM and mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms. myCompass is a fully automated, self-guided public health treatment program for common mental health problems. The impact of treatment on depressive symptoms, diabetes-related distress, anxiety symptoms, and self-care behavior was also examined. Methods: Participants with T2DM and mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms (N = 780) were recruited online via Google and Facebook advertisements targeting adults with T2DM and via community and general practice settings. Screening, consent, and self-report scales were all self-administered online. Participants were randomized using double-blind computerized block randomization to either myCompass (n = 391) for 8 weeks plus a 4-week tailing-off period or an active placebo intervention (n = 379). At baseline and postintervention (3 months), participants completed the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item, Diabetes Distress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 item, and items from the Self-Management Profile for Type 2 Diabetes. Results: myCompass users logged in an average of 6 times and completed an average of .29 modules. Healthy Lifestyles users logged in an average of 4 times and completed an average of 1.37 modules. At baseline, mean scores on several outcome measures, including the primary outcome of work and social functioning, were near to the normal range, despite an extensive recruitment process. Approximately 61.6% (473/780) of participants completed the postintervention assessment. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed improvement in functioning, depression, anxiety, diabetes distress, and healthy eating over time in both groups. Except for blood glucose monitoring and medication adherence, there were no specific between-group effects. Follow-up analyses suggested the outcomes did not depend on age, morbidity, or treatment engagement. Conclusions: Improvement in social and occupational functioning and the secondary outcomes was generally no greater for myCompass users than for users of the control program at 3 months postintervention. These findings should be interpreted in light of near-normal mean baseline scores on several variables, the self-selected study sample, and sample attrition. Further attention to factors influencing uptake and engagement with mental health treatments by people with T2DM, and the impact of illness comorbidity on patient conceptualization and experience of mental health symptoms, is essential to reduce the burden of T2DM.

We further investigated whether sleep characteristics (ie, insomnia symptoms and sleep duration) mediate these associations. Methods: Data come from 2865 U.S. adolescents (mean age = 15.53, SD = 0.73, 51.8% male) in the age 15 follow-up of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Adolescents completed surveys regarding sleep duration and insomnia symptoms, typical daily duration of four screen activities (social messaging, web surfing, TV/movie watching, and gaming), and depressive symptoms. We constructed a multiple mediation model to elucidate the associations between age 15 screen time, sleep and depressive symptoms, while adjusting for age 9 depressive symptoms. Results: Structural Equation Modeling analyses revealed that the association between screen time and depressive symptoms is partially or fully mediated by sleep. For social messaging, web surfing and TV/movie watching, the three sleep variables fully mediated the positive association between screen time and depressive symptoms. For gaming, the three sleep variables acted as partial mediators in the model, accounting for 38.5% of the association between gaming and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Our results highlight both screen-based activities and sleep behaviors as potential intervention targets to reduce depressive symptoms among adolescents.

Smartphone apps stand as a possible means to overcome such barriers. However, there is limited evidence to understand the use and efficacy of these apps. The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p &lt; .001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait-list control participants (p = .03). Boost Me was used significantly more than was Thought Challenger (p = .02); however, there was no evidence to suggest correlations between usage and changes in depression (ps &gt; .05). The present study provides initial support that intervention strategies for depression delivered via apps with human support can impact symptoms and may promote continued use over 6 weeks. This pilot also demonstrates the feasibility of future research regarding the delivery of behavioral and cognitive intervention strategies via apps.

Materials and Methods: For this scoping review, the CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published from January 1, 2008 to December 20, 2017 using terms relevant to digital games and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Results: Eight articles met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, seven of which presented studies with participants 50 years or older. Five of the eight studies assessed physical activity. Only two studies included a control group. Digital games significantly improved exercise capacity and energy expenditure but did not affect quality of life, self-efficacy, anxiety, or depression. Digital games were found enjoyable by 79%–93% of participants, including those with lower education or age; however, barriers to game use included being tired or bored, lack of interest in digital games, poor perception of fitness through games, sensor limitations, conflicts with daily life routine, and preferences for group exercise. Average adherence ranged from 70% to 100% over 2 weeks to 6 months of study duration, with higher adherence rates in studies that included human contact through supervision or social support. Conclusion: Paucity of studies about digital games for CVD SM behaviors precludes the need to undertake a full systematic review. Future studies examining digital games should include larger sample sizes, longer durations, game-design guided by behavioral change theoretical frameworks, and CVD SM behaviors in addition to physical activity behaviors.

Core clinical features of bipolar disorder include changes in behaviour. We aimed to investigate objective smartphone data reflecting behavioural activities to classify patients with bipolar disorder compared with healthy individuals. Methods: Objective smartphone data were automatically collected from 29 patients with bipolar disorder and 37 healthy individuals. Repeated measurements of objective smartphone data were performed during different affective states in patients with bipolar disorder over 12 weeks and compared with healthy individuals. Results: Overall, the sensitivity of objective smartphone data in patients with bipolar disorder versus healthy individuals was 0.92, specificity 0.39, positive predictive value 0.88 and negative predictive value 0.52. In euthymic patients versus healthy individuals, the sensitivity was 0.90, specificity 0.56, positive predictive value 0.85 and negative predictive value 0.67. In mixed models, automatically generated objective smartphone data (the number of text messages/day, the duration of phone calls/day) were increased in patients with bipolar disorder (during euthymia, depressive and manic or mixed states, and overall) compared with healthy individuals. The amount of time the smartphone screen was ‘on’ per day was decreased in patients with bipolar disorder (during euthymia, depressive state and overall) compared with healthy individuals. Conclusion: Objective smartphone data may represent a potential diagnostic behavioural marker in bipolar disorder and may be a candidate supplementary method to the diagnostic process in the future.

Method: Relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials were identified by searching PsycINFO, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases. Additional relevant studies were identified from reference lists of identified articles, grey literature and literature known to the working group. Evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations were formulated by synthesising the evidence from efficacy studies, considering effectiveness in routine practice, accessibility and availability of treatment options in Australia and New Zealand, fidelity, acceptability to patients, safety and costs. The draft guidelines were reviewed by expert and clinical advisors, key stakeholders, professional bodies, and specialist groups with interest and expertise in anxiety disorders. Results: The guidelines recommend a pragmatic approach beginning with psychoeducation and advice on lifestyle factors, followed by initial treatment selected in collaboration with the patient from evidence-based options, taking into account symptom severity, patient preference, accessibility and cost. Recommended initial treatment options for all three anxiety disorders are cognitive–behavioural therapy (face-to-face or delivered by computer, tablet or smartphone application), pharmacotherapy (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor together with advice about graded exposure to anxiety triggers), or the combination of cognitive–behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy. Conclusion: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and generalised anxiety disorder provide up-to-date guidance and advice on the management of these disorders for use by health professionals in Australia and New Zealand.

Asunción;Martínez, Nora;Fernández, Morise;Aguilar, Araceli",Substance Use & Misuse,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Web-based cognitive-behavioral interventions to reduce substance use can be a useful low-cost treatment for a large number of people, and an attractive option in countries where a greater availability of treatment is needed. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and initial effectiveness of a web-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for the reduction of substance use and depression compared with treatment as usual, with and without a printed self-help manual. Method: Individuals seeking outpatient treatment for substance use were randomly assigned to one of the following: (1) the web-based Help Program for Drug Abuse and Depression ( n = 23); (2) an in-person session with an addiction therapist and use of the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test Self-Help Strategies guide, followed by treatment as usual ( n = 25), or (3) treatment ordinarily offered in the participating treatment centers ( n = 26). The study took place in 2013–2014 and participants completed baseline, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up evaluation interviews. Results: Treatment retention and data availability were comparable in all three conditions. A reduction was observed from baseline to follow-up in average days of use [ F (1,28) = 29.70, p &lt; 0.001], severity of use [ F (2,28) = 143.66, p &lt; 0.001], and depressive symptomatology [ F = (4)16.40, p &lt; 0.001], independent of the type of treatment provided. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the web-based intervention to reduce substance abuse is feasible, although it is not more effective than other intervention modalities; its effectiveness must be evaluated in a larger sample. Attrition was a main limitation; future studies must improve retention and assess cost-effectiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Despite advances in treatments, its management over time remains a challenge; many treated for depression do not achieve full recovery or remain well for long. Novel ways to monitor patients are warranted, as well as better understanding of contributors to relapse or sustained wellness. Mobile health technologies (m-Health) are emerging as useful tools for real-time assessments of moods, behaviours and activities in a more convenient and less burdensome manner. Yet, there are numerous questions around privacy, reliability and accuracy of data collected via mobile apps. This review provides a critical overview of advances in m-Health and evaluate the future potential of smartphone technology in the assessment and treatment of depression. Recent findings: There is an abundance of apps in the market that claim to exert beneficial effects on the management of depression; to date, only a small fraction has been validated in clinical trials or has had the support of academic centers.

A total of 63 male college students with IGD were assigned into the intervention group (six-session CBI intervention) or the waiting-list control group. Structured questionnaires were administered at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up (T3), and 6-month follow-up (T4). Compared to the control group, a significant decrease in the severity of IGD in intervention group was found at post-intervention and lasting to 6 months after intervention. The value changes of craving could partially mediate the relationship between intervention and changes of IGD among all effects tests (immediate, T2-T1; short-term, T3-T1; and long-term effects, T4-T1). Further, explorations of the active ingredients of intervention found depression relief and shift of psychological needs from Internet to real life significantly predict craving amelioration at both post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. Although preliminary, the current study provides evidence for the value of craving-aimed intervention practice in IGD treatment and identifies two potential active ingredients for mitigation of craving, and the long-term therapeutic benefits are further conferred.

Objective smartphone data reflecting illness activity could facilitate early treatment and act as outcome in efficacy trials. A total of 29 patients with BD presenting with moderate to severe levels of depressive and manic symptoms used a smartphone‐based self‐monitoring system during 12 weeks. Objective smartphone data on behavioral activities were collected. Symptoms were clinically assessed every second week using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale. Objective smartphone data correlated with symptom severity. The more severe the depressive symptoms (1) the longer the smartphone's screen was “on”/day, (2) more received incoming calls/day, (3) fewer outgoing calls/day were made, (4) less answered incoming calls/day, (5) the patients moved less between cell towers IDs/day. Conversely, the more severe the manic symptoms (1) more outgoing text messages/day sent, (2) the phone calls/day were longer, (3) the fewer number of characters in incoming text messages/day, (4) the lower duration of outgoing calls/day, (5) the patients moved more between cell towers IDs/day. Further, objective smartphone data were able to discriminate between affective states. Objective smartphone data reflect illness severity, discriminates between affective states in BD and may facilitate the cooperation between patient and clinician.

10.1080/00207411.2016.1204823,The youth-mental health engagement network: An exploratory pilot study of a smartphone and computer-based personal health record for youth experiencing depressive symptoms,"Forchuk, Cheryl;Reiss, Jeff;Eichstedt, Julie;Singh, Devita;Collins, Kerry;Rudnick, Abraham;Walsh, Julie;Ethridge, Paige;Kutcher, Stan;Fisman, Sandra",International Journal of Mental Health,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"The Youth-Mental Health Engagement Network study explored the use of mobile technology to support youth in managing their mental health. The Lawson SMART record (LSR) is a web-based application that allows individuals to create and manage an electronic personal health record (ePHR). Through this record, individuals can store their personal health information (e.g., list of medications, family history, immunization records, allergies, care provider contact information, care plans, and crisis plans) and use interactive tools to manage their health care (e.g., mood monitor, reminder prompts, alerts, and mental health assessments). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of using an ePHR in providing mental health care to youth with mental illnesses who were experiencing depressive symptoms, from the perspectives of both the patients and their care providers. This 6-month study employed an exploratory descriptive design. Mixed methods research methodology was used to determine the uptake of the LSR as part of their mental health treatment by youth experiencing depressive symptoms. Participants included 41 patients, aged 16 to 21, receiving outpatient services from one of 9 care providers employed within a hospital-based youth mental health care program. Focus groups were held with participating care providers and patients throughout the study to explore youth and care provider perceptions of using the LSR for mental health care management. In addition, both patients and care providers completed surveys to elaborate on their use of and comfort with the technology. This study found that the majority of patients used a phone (90.6%) and computer (70.7%) daily and felt extremely comfortable using cell phones (71.9%) and computers (58.5%). Of the 41 patients, 9 (22%) had their smartphone lost, stolen, broken, or given away. Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions with patients and care providers revealed 6 themes: 1) extent of LSR use was related to the severity of illness and treatment intensity; 2) symptom tracking was the most common use of the LSR; 3) patients reported increased self-awareness and autonomy with LSR use; 4) use of the LSR changed and had the potential to enhance the therapeutic relationship; 5) use of the LSR was a good fit with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy treatment requirements; and 6) the LSR should be personalized and simplified. In a population of youth with mental illnesses who were experiencing depressive symptoms, the LSR was found to be useful and to fit well with standard treatment practices. However, youth would prefer a simpler tool. Future research should evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of using an ePHR in a larger sample of youth with mixed clinical presentations and over a longer period of time. This additional research would be valuable in understanding the usability and acceptability of smart technologies as an integral part of usual mental health care for youth.

10.12740/APP/19144,Trichotillomania in a 7 year old girl,"Nguyen, Mathew;Tharani, Shalini",Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Presents a case report of a 7 year old girl with trichotillomania. Trichotillomania is considered a type of impulse control disorder in DSM-IV-TR where repetitive hair pulling results in hair loss, distress, and social and occupational dysfunction. This case encountered a girl with skin picking and hair-pulling on her eyebrows, eyelashes, and the hairs on her arms and legs. There had been significant stressors in the child's life over the past few years. Although risk factors for hair pulling are unknown, most theories are associated with a transitional object or separation response to an impaired mother-child relationship in young children. Common comorbidities include depression, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), tic disorders, and OCD. While performing a wide search through PubMed for treatment, there was a dearth of studies showing treatment efficacy in children, adolescents, and adults. Medications, including antidepressants (eg. citalopram, fluoxetine, and clomipramine), have minimal role in treatment. The cornerstone treatment is habit reversal therapy (HRT), which is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Other forms of therapies including behavior therapy and simplified HRT appear promising. Due to limited statistical power involving populations below the age of 9 years, no definitive conclusions on effectiveness can be made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1111/bjc.12463,A randomized controlled trial testing theory‐driven enhancements to increase the efficacy of and engagement in a brief cognitive‐behavioural therapy text‐message intervention for co‐occurring posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and alcohol misuse,"Bedard‐Gilligan, Michele;Lindgren, Kristen;Dworkin, Emily;Tristao, Ty;Kaysen, Debra;Rhew, Isaac",British Journal of Clinical Psychology,,2023.10.31,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Engaging individuals with co‐occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse (AM) in effective treatments is difficult. Brief, self‐directed approaches that deliver empirically supported intervention techniques, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) strategies, via technology may be effective and easier‐to‐access alternatives to traditional in‐person therapy approaches for PTSD + AM. This paper describes the protocol for an intervention development study (NCT05372042) that evaluates a text‐message intervention combining CBT texts with techniques from cognitive psychology (message framing) and social psychology (growth mindsets) for treatment of PTSD + AM. Method: The study uses a 3 (message framing: gain vs. loss vs. no framing) × 2 (mindset: growth mindsets vs. not) factorial design to test enhancements to CBT texts. Individuals age 18+, who report symptoms of PTSD and AM, will be recruited to participate. Participants will complete screening, verification, and baseline measures. They will be randomized to condition and receive 3 text messages per week for 4 weeks. Participants will be assessed at post‐, 1‐, and 3‐month follow‐up. Results: Analyses will evaluate whether framing and growth mindsets enhance the efficacy of CBT texts. A priori decision rules will be applied to select the intervention condition that is both the most effective and the simplest, which will be tested in a follow‐up randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: This study will identify the simplest, most efficacious CBT intervention for PTSD + AM. Its use of cognitive and social psychology‐based enhancement and of a factorial decision can serve as examples of how to enhance and increase engagement in brief, self‐directed CBT interventions.

Methods Online surveys were conducted twice with mothers who gave birth to their first child between March and June 2020. The survey periods were November 2020 and May–June 2022. Measures included baseline characteristics and family environment factors, maternal postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), maternal lifestyle and mother-reported toddler behaviors, and Internet/media use. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ² test, trend test, and logistic regression. Results Of the 339 participants, 82 (24.1%) were in the “persistent maternal depression” group with high EPDS scores (≥ 9 points) at both time points, and 178 (52.5%) were in the “no maternal depression” group with low EPDS scores (&lt; 9 points) at both time points. Persistent maternal depression was associated with sleep, eating behavior, physical activity, parenting emotions, and abusive behavior of mothers. Furthermore, persistent maternal depression may be related to undesirable toddler behaviors such as smartphone overuse and hyperactivity-like symptoms. Conclusions for Practice The persistence of postpartum depression is influenced by factors such as mothers’ parenting emotions. Preventing and supporting maternal depression in mothers can foster favorable behaviors in toddlers. In Japan, enhanced individualized, ongoing support for postpartum mothers, tailored in duration and form, could promote both maternal well-being and positive parenting practices.

This randomised‐controlled pilot trial examined the efficacy of a digital, guided cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia adapted to shift work (SleepCare) in nurses with shift work disorder. The hypothesis was that SleepCare reduces insomnia severity compared with a waitlist control condition. A total of 46 unmedicated nurses suffering from shift work disorder with insomnia (age: 39.7 ± 12.1 years; 80.4% female) were randomised to the SleepCare group or the waitlist control group. The primary outcome measure was the Insomnia Severity Index. Other questionnaires on sleep, mental health and occupational functioning, sleep diary data and actigraphy data were analysed as secondary outcomes. Assessments were conducted before (T0), after the intervention/waitlist period (T1), and 6 months after treatment completion (T2). The SleepCare group showed a significant reduction in insomnia severity from T0 to T1 compared with the control condition (β = −4.73, SE = 1.12, p &lt; 0.001). Significant improvements were observed in sleepiness, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, pre‐sleep arousal, sleep effort, self‐reported sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency. No significant effect was found in actigraphy data. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognitive irritation and work ability improved significantly. Overall, satisfaction and engagement with the intervention was high. SleepCare improved insomnia severity, sleep, mental health and occupational functioning. This is the first randomised‐controlled trial investigating the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in a population suffering from shift work disorder with insomnia. Future research should further explore these effects with larger sample sizes and active control conditions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

The results demonstrated that text-related activities lowered withdrawal and attention deficit. Higher use of online communities or personal websites was associated with higher depressive symptoms, withdrawal, somatic symptoms, and aggression. Online gaming increased both attention deficit’ initial value and its decrease rate. Taking photos decreased withdrawal. Watching videos increased depressive symptoms, withdrawal, and attention deficit. Listening to music lowered attention deficit’ initial value and somatic symptoms’ decrease rate. Accessing adult websites increased attention deficit and aggression. Educational information searches reduced attention deficit and aggression. Online transactions increased somatic symptoms. This study indicates that adolescents' problem behaviors may appear differently depending on the type of information technology use.

Mobile health (m-Health) apps can lead to greater patient treatment adherence and health behaviour change. This study aimed to evaluate the health behaviour change of elderly people through a healthcare programme focused on activation with the support of technology. Three phases were conducted: (1) pre-intervention – design of the intervention protocol and the app, (2) intervention – randomised clinical trial with 41 overweight/obese elderly people. m-Health app-supported group psychotherapy was compared with group psychotherapy only and individual psychotherapy (control) and (3) post-intervention – statistical analysis, intervention’s assistant interviews and app heuristics evaluation. By crossing the results, the study has shown that there was no significant difference in the activation level before and after intervention between groups. However, there was a significant increase from the initial mean score to the final one when considering the three groups together. Group therapy, whether with or without the support of the app, was more effective for behaviour change measured by the achievement of the goals, than individual psychotherapy. The lack of impact on group therapy with app support calls into question which and how much technology support is useful.

However, few studies have compared it to an active comparator. The current study randomly assigned 138 participants seeking help for perfectionism to iCBT-P or Internet-based Unified Protocol (iUP). Both treatments provided guidance on demand from a therapist and were eight weeks in duration. The results indicated large within-group effects of Cohen’s d 2.03 (iCBT) and 2.51 (iUP) on the Clinical Perfectionism Questionnaire at post-treatment, and maintained effects at 6- and 12-month follow-up, but no between-group difference (β = 0.02, SE = 1.04, p = .98). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, quality of life, self-compassion, procrastination, and stress ranged from small to large, with no differences between the conditions. Both treatments were deemed credible, relevant, of high quality, and well-adhered by the participants. Further research needs to be conducted, but the findings could indicate a lack of specificity, perhaps suggesting there is no need to differentiate between different treatments that are transdiagnostic in nature.

R.;van Klaveren, C.;Cornelisz, I.;Toffolo, M. B. J.;van Straten, A.;van Gelder, J. -L.",Psychological Medicine,,2022.5.23,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Access to evidence-based psychological treatment is a challenge worldwide. We assessed the effectiveness of a fully automated aviophobia smartphone app treatment delivered in combination with a $5 virtual reality (VR) viewer. Methods: In total, 153 participants from the Dutch general population with aviophobia symptoms and smartphone access were randomized in a single-blind randomized controlled trial to either an automated VR cognitive behavior therapy (VR-CBT) app treatment condition ( n = 77) or a wait-list control condition ( n = 76). The VR-CBT app was delivered over a 6-week period in the participants' natural environment. Online self-report assessments were completed at baseline, post-treatment, at 3-month and at 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (FAS). Analyses were based on intent-to-treat. Results: A significant reduction of aviophobia symptoms at post-test for the VR-CBT app compared with the control condition [ p &lt; 0.001; d = 0. 98 (95% CI 0.65–1.32)] was demonstrated. The dropout rate was 21%. Results were maintained at 3-month follow-up [within-group d = 1.14 (95% CI 0.46–1.81)] and at 12-month follow-up [within-group d = 1.12 (95% CI 0.46–1.79)]. Six participants reported adverse effects of cyber sickness symptoms. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that fully automated mobile VR-CBT therapy delivered in a natural setting can maintain long-term effectiveness in reducing aviophobia symptoms. In doing so, it offers an accessible and scalable evidence-based treatment solution that can be applied globally at a fraction of the cost of current treatment alternatives.

Approximately 84% of American adolescents own a smartphone, which can continuously and unobtrusively track variables potentially predictive of heightened negative emotions (e.g. activity levels, location, pattern of phone usage). The extent to which built-in smartphone sensors can reliably predict states of elevated negative affect in adolescents is an open question. Methods Adolescent participants ( n = 22; ages 13–18) with low to high levels of depressive symptoms were followed for 15 weeks using a combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and continuously collected passive smartphone sensor data. EMAs probed negative emotional states (i.e. anger, sadness and anxiety) 2–3 times per day every other week throughout the study (total: 1145 EMA measurements). Smartphone accelerometer, location and device state data were collected to derive 14 discrete estimates of behavior, including activity level, percentage of time spent at home, sleep onset and duration, and phone usage. Results A personalized ensemble machine learning model derived from smartphone sensor data outperformed other statistical approaches (e.g. linear mixed model) and predicted states of elevated anger and anxiety with acceptable discrimination ability (area under the curve (AUC) = 74% and 71%, respectively), but demonstrated more modest discrimination ability for predicting states of high sadness (AUC = 66%). Conclusions To the extent that smartphone data could provide reasonably accurate real-time predictions of states of high negative affect in teens, brief ‘just-in-time’ interventions could be immediately deployed via smartphone notifications or mental health apps to alleviate these states.

Improving access to empirically based interventions is critical, and mobile health (mHealth) interventions are growing in support. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported intervention that has been applied to college students, via mobile app, and in brief intervals. Objective: This study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of an ACT-based mHealth intervention using a microrandomized trial (MRT) design. Methods: Participants (N=34) were 18- to 19-year-old first-generation college students reporting distress, who participated in a 6-week intervention period of twice-daily assessments and randomization to intervention. Participants logged symptoms, moods, and behaviors on the mobile app Lorevimo. After the assessment, participants were randomized to an ACT-based intervention or no intervention. Analyses examined proximal change after randomization using a weighted and centered least squares approach. Outcomes included values-based and avoidance behavior, as well as depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Results: The findings indicated the intervention was safe and feasible. The intervention increased values-based behavior but did not decrease avoidance behavior. The intervention reduced depressive symptoms but not perceived stress. Conclusions: An MRT of an mHealth ACT-based intervention among distressed first-generation college students suggests that a larger MRT is warranted. Future investigations may tailor interventions to contexts where intervention is most impactful. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

A 12-week family-based, Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for 7-15 year-old autistic youth with anxiety and/or OCD was developed as a potential method to address this problem. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from stakeholders (parents, youth, clinicians) was gathered on an initial draft of content before conducting a pilot trial. This feedback suggested high quality, engagement, usability, and informativeness of the material. Suggestions were incorporated into the treatment program that was tested in a pilot trial. Eight families were randomized to the iCBT program with either 1) weekly email support or 2) weekly email support plus biweekly telehealth check-ins, and seven of these families completed pre- and post-treatment assessments. An average reduction of 39% in anxiety severity scores was found, with six of the seven being classified as responders. Preliminary evidence suggests that family-based iCBT is an acceptable and promising treatment for autistic youth with anxiety and/or obsessive-compulsive disorders that should be further modified and tested in future work.

Abd",International Journal of Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that depression, anxiety, and stress disorders (DASDs) are prevalent worldwide, resulting in the loss of 13 million years of life and trillions of dollars of economic loss annually. Mobile-based health (M-health) interventions can employ mental health interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescents worldwide. Arab youth who struggle with DASDs do not tend to engage in mental therapies, but gamification and modularization have the potential to boost their appeal. The authors have selected effective CBT interventions for DASDs, adapted them to digital interactive formats, and integrated gamification concepts. An Arabic mobile application, Sokoon, which means relaxation and relief, may encourage Arab users to practice the required CBT skills for mild-to-moderate DASDs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Sokoon App in a small group of adults who had signs of aDASDs. Sokoon was practicable, well-received by users, and had a positive impact on participants' feelings of anxiety and sadness.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the attitudes towards an Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) intervention for the treatment of depression as well as its level of normalization and early implementation success (operationalized as intention to use the intervention) among German health care professionals (HCP). Data were collected following onetime information sessions on an iCBT tool using the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS) and the Normalization Process Theory Measure (NoMAD). Influences of attitudes on normalization as well as influences of attitude and normalization on intention to use were analysed. Most participants (n = 78; 86.3% clinical psychologists, 9.6% general practitioners) intended to use the intervention in the future (82.1%) and had a moderately positive attitude towards iCBT interventions. The perceived level of normalization (i.e., the level of how well iCBT is integrated in practice) was moderate in the overall sample. High appeal, openness towards iCBT, low requirement to use it, and low perceived divergence (perceived difference between current and new practices) had a significant positive effect on normalization. This study indicates that iCBT can be implemented in German routine mental healthcare. However, implementation processes might benefit from tailored information campaigns that clearly highlight the effectiveness and benefits of iCBT interventions to foster openness towards iCBT interventions among HCPs.

10.1080/00050067.2021.1979884,Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Mahoney, Alison;Li, Ian;Grierson, Ashlee;Millard, Michael;Haskelberg, Hila;Mason, Elizabeth",Australian Psychologist,,2021.3.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Online cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) provides scalable access to psychological interventions; however, the effectiveness of these courses during COVID-19 has not been examined. This study investigated the uptake and potential effectiveness of iCBT-I during the first 10 months of the pandemic in Australia (March-December 2020) and compared outcomes in the year prior. Method: Two thousand six hundred and ninety-four adults commenced a four-lesson iCBT-I course (1,883 during the pandemic; 811 in the year before). Measures of insomnia and psychological distress were administered pre-, mid- and post-treatment. Results: In the COVID-19 period, we observed a 140% increase in monthly course registrations compared to the year prior (with a peak increase of 257% from April-June 2020). Insomnia symptom severity was marginally lower for the during-COVID group compared to the pre-COVID group, although levels of psychological distress were similar. Before and during COVID-19, iCBT-I was associated with large effect size reductions in insomnia symptom severity (gs = .86–1.09) and small effect size improvements in psychological distress and wellbeing (gs = 0.34–0.41). Conclusion: iCBT-I uptake substantially increased during the pandemic; treatment outcomes were similar. The findings demonstrate the scalability and potential effectiveness of iCBT-I. Key Points: What is already known about this topic: (1) Insomnia is a significant public health issue. (2) Internet delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) is effective in reducing insomnia symptom severity. (3) The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on mental health with higher estimated rates of insomnia during the pandemic. What this topic adds: (1) Uptake of an online insomnia course increased by &gt;180% during COVID-19. (2) The course was associated with large effect size reductions in insomnia symptoms. (3) Results highlight the utility and scalability of digital mental health services. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

One of the main health risks refugees in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region suffer from is mental health disorders, mainly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Due to the limited accessibility of mental health services and the shortage of mental health professionals in host communities, refugees end up neglecting their conditions and subsequent consequences, which result in a long-term social, psychological, and economic impact. The following scoping review aims to evaluate PTSD interventions implemented for refugee children in developing nations within the MENA region. The York methodology was used to ensure transparency, enable replication of the search strategy, and increase the reliability of study findings. The results indicate that several strategies such as art therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, digital-based educational games, writing for recovery, group theraplay, and profound stress attunement framework deemed effective in decreasing PTSD symptoms on a short-term basis. However, future interventions should apply more sustainable strategies to help refugee children in the long-term management of the chronic mental illness. Additional research regarding this topic is needed in the MENA region. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

It is unknown, however, how dCBT-I compares to individual face-to-face (FtF) CBT-I for individuals referred to clinical secondary services. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to test whether fully automated dCBT-I is non-inferior to individual FtF CBT-I in reducing insomnia severity. Methods: Eligible participants were adult patients with a diagnosis of insomnia disorder recruited from a sleep clinic provided via public mental health services in Norway. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was the primary outcome measure. The non-inferiority margin was defined a priori as 2.0 points on the ISI at week 33. Results: Individuals were randomized to FtF CBT-I ( n = 52) or dCBT-I ( n = 49); mean baseline ISI scores were 18.4 (SD 3.7) and 19.4 (SD 4.1), respectively. At week 33, the mean scores were 8.9 (SD 6.0) and 12.3 (SD 6.9), respectively. There was a significant time effect for both interventions ( p &lt; 0.001); and the mean difference in ISI at week 33 was −2.8 (95% CI: −4.8 to −0.8; p = 0.007, Cohen’s d = 0.7), and −4.6 at week 9 (95% CI −6.6 to −2.7; p &lt; 0.001), Cohen’s d = 1.2. Conclusions: At the primary endpoint at week 33, the 95% CI of the estimated treatment difference included the non-inferiority margin and was wholly to the left of zero. Thus, this result is inconclusive regarding the possible inferiority or non-inferiority of dCBT-I over FtF CBT-I, but dCBT-I performed significantly worse than FtF CBT-I. At week 9, dCBT-I was inferior to FtF CBT-I as the 95% CI was fully outside the non-inferiority margin. These findings highlight the need for more clinical research to clarify the optimal application, dissemination, and implementation of dCBT-I.

10.1093/sleep/zsab166,Efficacy of a stepped care approach to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in cancer patients: A noninferiority randomized controlled trial,"Savard, Josée;Ivers, Hans;Savard, Marie-Hélène;Morin, Charles M.;Caplette-Gingras, Aude;Bouchard, Stéphane;Lacroix, Guy",Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research,,2021.1.22,Scholarly Journals,English,"Study Objectives: Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for cancer-related insomnia, but its accessibility is very limited in routine care. A stepped care approach has been recommended as a cost-effective way to make CBT-I more widely accessible. However, no controlled study has yet been published about the efficacy of this approach. The goal of this non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the short and long-term efficacy of a stepped care CBT-I (StepCBT-I) to a standard face-to-face CBT-I (StanCBT-I). Methods: A total of 177 cancer patients were randomized to: (1) StanCBT-I (6 face-to-face CBT-I sessions; n = 59) or (2) StepCBT-I ( n = 118). In the StepCBT-I group, patients with less severe insomnia first received a web-based CBT-I ( n = 65), while those with more severe insomnia received 6 face-to-face CBT-I sessions ( n = 53). In both cases, patients could receive up to three booster sessions of CBT-I if they still had insomnia symptoms following this first step. Results: Results indicated that the Step-CBT-I group showed an Insomnia Severity Index score reduction and a sleep efficiency (on a sleep diary) increase that was not significantly inferior to that of StanCBT-I at all post-treatment time points. Analyses of secondary outcomes indicated significant time effects ( p s &lt; .001) and no significant group-by-time interactions (ps from .07 to .91) on other sleep diary parameters, sleep medication use, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life scores. Conclusion( s): The efficacy of stepped care CBT-I is not inferior to that of a standard face-to-face intervention and is a valuable approach to making this treatment more widely accessible to cancer patients.

This study aims at testing in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the effectiveness of a disorder‐specific, Internet‐delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (ICBT) intervention for AjD. Participants were randomly allocated to either an ICBT with brief weekly telephone support ( n = 34) or a waiting list group ( n = 34). Beck's inventories for depression and anxiety were used as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were AjD symptoms, post‐traumatic growth, positive and negative affect, and quality of life. In all, 76.5% of the participants completed the intervention. Compared with the control group, participants in the intervention condition showed significantly greater improvement in all outcomes (Cohen's d ranged from 0.54 to 1.21) except in anxiety symptoms measured by Beck Anxiety Inventory ( d = 0.27). Only ICBT group showed a significant improvement in post‐traumatic growth, positive and negative affect, and quality of life. The number of cases that achieved clinically meaningful change in all outcome measures was also higher in the ICBT group. All therapeutic gains were maintained at 3‐, 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐ups. The current study provides evidence on the effectiveness of ICBT interventions to reduce the impact of AjD. Results suggest that brief self‐help intervention with minimal therapist support is more effective than the mere passage of time in reducing the distress symptoms associated to the disorder and also can confer additional benefits.

Digital solutions improve access to care and can be integrated into patients’ everyday lives. Objective: ACTsmart, a guided smartphone-delivered ACT intervention, was developed to improve the accessibility of an evidence-based behavioral treatment for chronic pain. In the present study, we evaluated the preliminary efficacy of ACTsmart in adults with chronic pain. Methods: The study was an open-label pilot trial. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks, and participants completed all outcome measures at pretreatment and posttreatment and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, with weekly assessments of selected measures during treatment. The primary outcome was pain interference. The secondary outcomes were psychological flexibility, values, insomnia, anxiety, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and pain intensity. All outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Results: The sample consisted of 34 adults (88% women) with long-standing chronic pain (M=20.4 years, SD=11.7). Compliance to treatment was high, and at the end of treatment, we observed a significant improvement in the primary outcome of pain interference (d = –1.01). All secondary outcomes significantly improved from pretreatment to posttreatment with small to large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained throughout 12 months of follow-up. Conclusion: The results of this pilot study provide preliminary support for ACTsmart as an accessible and effective behavioral health treatment for adults with chronic pain and warrant a randomized controlled trial to further evaluate the efficacy of the intervention.

Psychological treatment of loneliness can be effective, but the evidence base is limited. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of 2 internet-based interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IIPT) relative to a wait-list control group and each other. Methods: A total of 170 participants were recruited and randomized to either 9 weeks of ICBT ( n = 68), IIPT ( n = 68), or a wait-list condition ( n = 34). The primary outcome was loneliness, measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale before, during, and after treatment. Secondary measures of psychiatric disorders and quality of life were administered before and after treatment. Follow-up was conducted 4 months after the treatment had ended. Primary outcome data were analyzed using growth curve modeling. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using robust regression models. The trial was preregistered (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03807154). Results: The ICBT condition had a significantly greater impact on loneliness compared to the wait-list and IIPT conditions. Effect sizes were moderate to large (Cohen d = 0.71) compared to the wait-list and moderate ( d = 0.53) compared to IIPT. The IIPT condition did not differ significantly from the wait-list. Both active treatments led to significant increases in quality of life. Only the ICBT group had significantly lower symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety compared to the wait-list group. Treatment gains were maintained but not improved at follow-up. Conclusions: ICBT can be an efficacious option for alleviating loneliness. The IIPT intervention was not as effective.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if a brief self-guided, online psychological intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated symptoms. Methods: 670 adults from the Swedish general population reporting daily uncontrollable worry about CO VID-19 and its possible consequences (e.g., illness, death, the economy, one’s family) were randomised (1:1 ratio) to a 3-week self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry and associated symptoms, or a waiting list of equal duration. The primary outcome measure was a COVID-19 adapted version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale administered at baseline and weeks 1–3 (primary endpoint). Follow-up assessments were conducted 1 month after treatment completion. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04341922) before inclusion of the first participant. Results: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in COVID-19-related worry for the intervention group compared to the waiting list (β = 1.14, Z = 9.27, p &lt; 0.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58–0.90]). Improvements were also seen on all secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning, insomnia, and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high. No serious adverse events were recorded.

10.1111/hsc.13074,A preliminary comparison of the efficacy of online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) stress management interventions for social and healthcare workers,"Barrett, Kate;Stewart, Ian",Health & Social Care in the Community,,2019.11.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Social and healthcare workers have been shown to experience greater levels of illness, depression and burnout as a result of chronic workplace stress. The purpose of this study was to examine whether brief online ACT and CBT interventions could reduce the experience of stress and burnout in employees, while also improving mental health and psychological flexibility. A total of 42 individuals working within the social and healthcare professions were randomly assigned to either a 2‐week online ACT or CBT intervention. Recruitment was undertaken internationally, although the majority of participants were based in Ireland at the time of their participation (79%). Participants’ perceived stress, burnout, mental health and work‐related psychological flexibility were assessed at baseline and post‐treatment. Intent‐to‐treat analyses were conducted on all data. Outcomes indicated that both interventions resulted in significant improvements in stress, burnout and mental health scores from baseline to post‐treatment. No significant differences were observed between ACT and CBT conditions, or in psychological flexibility scores from baseline to post‐treatment. Reliable Change Index (RCI) scores indicated that clinically significant improvements in stress and mental health were seen in 42% and 19% of programme‐completers, respectively. These results provide preliminary evidence for the usefulness of brief internet‐delivered ACT and CBT interventions for the treatment of occupational stress and its comorbid symptoms. Online programmes with a longer duration and additional therapist support should be evaluated, as these may improve the outcomes of future interventions.

Recently, virtual reality (VR) therapy has emerged as a promising method to increase psychological treatment motivation and accessibility. However, few studies have examined the potential of VR technology for the management of IGD, and VR content tailored to IGD characteristics remains scarce. Objective: This preliminary study aimed to examine the potential of a VR-based program that was designed to help users identify their leisure time use patterns, especially those related to gaming, and to modify their gaming overuse by alternative activities provided in the VR content. Moreover, to investigate whether users' VR activities reflect various clinical variables of IGD in youth, we examined the relationships among the leisure time activity selection pattern, built-in response, and speech data obtained from the VR program, as well as symptom severity of internet gaming, psychiatric comorbidities, and motivation of participants reported through relevant questionnaire data. Methods: Three types of VR content (understanding my daily activities at home, finding an alternative activity to internet gaming at home, expressing contradictory opinions toward a friend's gaming beliefs) were developed by simulating the daily situations in which patients with IGD can select alternative free-time leisure activities. We examined internet addiction, mental health problems, and motivation for 23 IGD and 29 control participants. Behavioral and self-rated responses from VR, such as alternative activity selection data and speech patterns (speech time, speech satisfaction, and speech accordance), and results from various questionnaires were compared between groups. The correlations between IGD behaviors in VR and real-life behaviors assessed by questionnaire measures were analyzed. Results: Significant correlations were found between internet gaming behavior and user activity data, such as speech and activity selection pattern, in our VR program. Our results showed that the IGD group had fewer leisure activities and preferred game or digital activities to other types of activities compared to controls, even in VR. There was a positive relationship between the viability of alternative leisure activities the participants selected in VR and the amount of perceived satisfaction from that activity (r = .748, P &lt; .001). Speech accordance in the IGD group was lower than in the control group and was correlated negatively with Internet Addiction Test and Internet Addiction Test-gaming scores (r = .300, P = .03) but positively with users' motivation (r = .312, P = .02). Conclusions: The results from our VR program can provide information about daily activity patterns of youths with IGD and the relationship between user VR activities and IGD symptoms, which can be useful in applying VR technology to IGD management.

10.1093/schbul/sbaa121,Geolocation as a digital phenotyping measure of negative symptoms and functional outcome,"Raugh, Ian M.;James, Sydney H.;Gonzalez, Cristina M.;Chapman, Hannah C.;Cohen, Alex S.;Kirkpatrick, Brian;Strauss, Gregory P.",Schizophrenia Bulletin,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Negative symptoms and functional outcome have traditionally been assessed using clinical rating scales, which rely on retrospective self-reports and have several inherent limitations that impact validity. These issues may be addressed with more objective digital phenotyping measures. In the current study, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel “passive” digital phenotyping method: geolocation. Method: Participants included outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ: n = 44), outpatients with bipolar disorder (BD: n =19), and demographically matched healthy controls (CN: n = 42) who completed 6 days of “active” digital phenotyping assessments (eg, surveys) while geolocation was recorded. Results: Results indicated that SZ patients show less activity than CN and BD, particularly, in their travel from home. Geolocation variables demonstrated convergent validity by small to medium correlations with negative symptoms and functional outcome measured via clinical rating scales, as well as active digital phenotyping behavioral indices of avolition, asociality, and anhedonia. Discriminant validity was supported by low correlations with positive symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Reliability was supported by good internal consistency and moderate stability across days. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of geolocation as an objective measure of negative symptoms and functional outcome. Geolocation offers enhanced precision and the ability to take a “big data” approach that facilitates sophisticated computational models. Near-continuous recordings and large numbers of samples may make geolocation a novel outcome measure for clinical trials due to enhanced power to detect treatment effects.

Recent studies show that Type D personality might be an important predictor of social behavior. Hence, the current exploratory study aims to examine, using ecological assessment, whether Type D personality is associated with a lower likelihood to engage in social encounters in patients with cardiovascular disease. Method: Cardiac patients who participated in the Do CHANGE (Phase 2) trial were included in current analysis. As part of the Do CHANGE intervention, real-life data were collected in the intervention group using the MOVES app, which was installed on patients’ mobile phones. For a period of 6 months, Global Positioning System (GPS) data from the participating patients were collected. From the GPS data, 3 target variables were computed: (a) general activity level, (b) social variety, and (c) social opportunity. Results: A total of 70 patients were included in the analysis. Patients with a Type D personality had lower scores on the “social opportunity” variable compared to non–Type D patients ( F = 6.72; p = .01). Type D personality was associated with lower social participation after adjusting for depression and anxiety. No association between Type D personality and general activity or behavioral variety was observed. Conclusions: This is the first study to use an ecological measure to assess social behavior of cardiac patients with a Type D personality. Results show that Type D personality might be associated with lower social engagement, which could, in turn, partly explain its association with adverse health outcomes.

The audio program consisted of eight compact discs and a workbook while the computer program consisted of 11 modules of similar duration provided on a tablet PC. Both interventions consisted of the following topics: 1) introduction, 2) identifying and changing unhelpful thoughts, 3) addressing feelings, 4) relaxation, 5) engaging in pleasant events, 6) assertiveness, and 7) problem-solving. Methods: Fifty-one older adults were recruited from medical settings and rural communities and randomly assigned to an immediate treatment group (computer or audio) with minimal contact or a four-week minimal contact delayed treatment control condition. Results: Participants rated computer- based and audio-based cognitive behavioral therapy fairly equally, with 75% of those who received audio treatment and 85% of those who received computer-based treatment indicating benefits to their mood. Discussion: Computer-based or audio-based cognitive behavioral treatments may be valuable, low-cost modalities to deliver psychotherapy to older adults with depressive symptoms within a health care setting. Both modalities seem to be accepted by older adults. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Despite the many benefits of social networking, a small minority of individuals appear to develop issues surrounding social media use, and more specifically Facebook use. It has, therefore, led some scholars to describe such problematic activity as a behavioral addiction. Such problematic behaviors have been reported in many countries including Italy. The present study validated and examined the reliability and validity of the Italian version of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale (BFAS) by conducting a psychometric examination among an Italian sample of adults (n = 217; aged 18 to 68 years). Internal reliability was examined using various indicators, including Cronbach’s α, which was excellent (α = 0.94). Results indicated that Facebook addiction was significantly correlated with social media addiction, smartphone addiction, narcissism, depression, and self-esteem. The results of the present study support the use of the Italian version of the BFAS in research and confirms the uni-dimensional nature of the single factor proposed by the original authors.

Although these themes have been explored in extant research, much remains to be learned with regard to how the challenges of aging and technology use and the experiences of participating in a social and learning environment are interrelated. Objective: This study aimed to perform a qualitative analysis of data collected from MoodTech, a pilot study of an internet-based intervention with a peer support component for older adults with symptoms of depression, to better understand the participants’ experience of using technological interventions, including the challenges and benefits that they experienced over the course of these interventions. Methods: We employed an inductive qualitative analysis method based on grounded theory methodology and interpretative phenomenological analysis to analyze participant textual data. These textual data were of 3 main types: (1) assignments in which participants challenged their negative thoughts, (2) status updates, and (3) comments in the peer support component of the intervention. Results: We have presented the results through 3 main themes: (1) the challenges of aging as seen through the participants’ comments, (2) the difficulties experienced by the participants in using MoodTech, and (3) the benefits they derived from participating. Conclusions: This paper offers several contributions concerning study participants’ experiences with internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) interventions with a peer support component and design considerations for developing complex technological interventions that support the challenges participants experience due to aging and cognitive difficulties. First, technical issues encountered by older adults within the context of the intervention can interact with and exacerbate the insecurities they experience in life, and it is important to consider how intervention components might be designed to mitigate these issues. Second, peer support can be employed as a mechanism to facilitate communication, support, and collaborative problem solving among participants in an intervention. The insights from this paper can inform the design of iCBT interventions for older adults. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

The aims of this paper are twofold: (1) to describe the study protocol of the APOLO-Teens randomized controlled effectiveness trial and (2) to present baseline descriptive information of the Portuguese sample. Methods: APOLO-Teens includes adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years with BMI percentile ≥ 85 ( N = 210; 60.00% girls, BMI z -score 2.40 ± 0.75) undergoing hospital ambulatory treatment for overweight/obesity. Participants completed a set of self-report measures regarding eating behaviors and habits, psychological functioning (depression, anxiety, stress, and impulsivity), physical activity, and quality of life. Results: Depression, anxiety, stress, impulsivity, and percentage body fat were inversely associated with health-related quality of life ( r s = −0.39 to −0.62), while physical activity out-of-school was positively correlated with health-related quality of life ( r s = 0.22). When compared to boys, girls demonstrated statistically significant higher scores on psychological distress, disturbed eating behaviors, impulsivity, were less active at school and had lower scores on the health-related quality of life ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The results showed that there were gender differences in key psychological constructs that are likely to determine success with the treatment and that, therefore, need to be considered in future interventions. The results of APOLO-Teens randomized controlled trial will determine the impact of these constructs on the efficacy and adherence to a web-based intervention for weight loss in the Portuguese population.

Reducing depression rates is difficult because of persistently stressful work environments and inadequate time or resources to access traditional mental health care services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an opportunity to deliver real-time interventions in the real world. In addition, the delivery times of interventions can be based on real-time data collected with a mobile device. To date, data and analyses informing the timing of delivery of mHealth interventions are generally lacking. Objective: This study aimed to investigate when to provide mHealth interventions to individuals in stressful work environments to improve their behavior and mental health. The mHealth interventions targeted 3 categories of behavior: mood, activity, and sleep. The interventions aimed to improve 3 different outcomes: weekly mood (assessed through a daily survey), weekly step count, and weekly sleep time. We explored when these interventions were most effective, based on previous mood, step, and sleep scores. Methods: We conducted a 6-month micro-randomized trial on 1565 medical interns. Medical internship, during the first year of physician residency training, is highly stressful, resulting in depression rates several folds higher than those of the general population. Every week, interns were randomly assigned to receive push notifications related to a particular category (mood, activity, sleep, or no notifications). Every day, we collected interns’ daily mood valence, sleep, and step data. We assessed the causal effect moderation by the previous week’s mood, steps, and sleep. Specifically, we examined changes in the effect of notifications containing mood, activity, and sleep messages based on the previous week’s mood, step, and sleep scores. Moderation was assessed with a weighted and centered least-squares estimator. Results: We found that the previous week’s mood negatively moderated the effect of notifications on the current week’s mood with an estimated moderation of −0.052 ( P = .001). That is, notifications had a better impact on mood when the studied interns had a low mood in the previous week. Similarly, we found that the previous week’s step count negatively moderated the effect of activity notifications on the current week’s step count, with an estimated moderation of −0.039 ( P = .01) and that the previous week’s sleep negatively moderated the effect of sleep notifications on the current week’s sleep with an estimated moderation of −0.075 ( P &lt; .001). For all three of these moderators, we estimated that the treatment effect was positive (beneficial) when the moderator was low, and negative (harmful) when the moderator was high. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an individual’s current state meaningfully influences their receptivity to mHealth interventions for mental health. Timing interventions to match an individual’s state may be critical to maximizing the efficacy of interventions.

Social anxiety is one of the most common sources of mental distress in the population, and many people with symptoms do not seek help for what represents a significant public health problem. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided cognitive behavioral internet intervention for people with social anxiety symptoms in the general population. Methods: We conducted a two-group randomized controlled trial in England between May 11, 2016, and June 27, 2018. Adults with social anxiety symptoms who were not receiving treatment for social anxiety were recruited using online advertisements. All participants had unrestricted access to usual care and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either a Web-based unguided self-help intervention based on cognitive behavioral principles or a waiting list control group. All outcomes were collected through self-report online questionnaires. The primary outcome was the change in 17-item Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN-17) score from baseline to 6 weeks using a linear mixed-effect model that used data from all time points (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). Results: A total of 2122 participants were randomized, and 6 were excluded from analyses because they were ineligible. Of the 2116 eligible randomized participants (mean age 37 years; 80.24%, 1698/2116 women), 70.13% (1484/2116) had follow-up data available for analysis, and 56.95% (1205/2116) had data on the primary outcome, although attrition was higher in the intervention arm. At 6 weeks, the mean (95% CI) adjusted difference in change in SPIN-17 score in the intervention group compared with control was −1.94 (−3.13 to −0.75; P = .001), a standardized mean difference effect size of 0.2. The improvement was maintained at 12 months. Given the high dropout rate, sensitivity analyses explored missing data assumptions, with results that were consistent with those of the primary analysis. The economic evaluation demonstrated cost-effectiveness with a small health status benefit and a reduction in health service utilization. Conclusions: For people with social anxiety symptoms who are not receiving other forms of help, this study suggests that the use of an online self-help tool based on cognitive behavioral principles can provide a small improvement in social anxiety symptoms compared with no intervention, although dropout rates were high.

10.1007/s11482-018-9654-8,Quality of life outcomes in internet-delivered (<i>Space from Depression</i>) treatment for depression,"Enrique, A.;Burke, J.;Richards, D.;Timulak, L.",Applied Research in Quality of Life,,2018.1.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes in interventions for depression are an area in the literature that has received little focus, particularly in trials relating to internet-delivered psychological interventions. Evaluating QoL outcomes are necessary to more completely understand if an intervention is successful in the treatment of depression, given that a decrease in negative symptoms in depression does not equate to synonymous increase in QoL. This secondary analysis study is aimed to examine the effects of an internet-delivered intervention for a mild to moderate depressed sample on QoL. 188 participants were randomly allocated to the Space from Depression intervention ( n = 96) or a waiting-list group ( n = 92). The intervention is an eight-module online cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention for depression. The trial had a duration of 8 weeks and the results were explored up to 3 months later. QoL was measured using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) at different time points. The intervention produced positive effects in the global scores of QoL at post-treatment an these results were maintained at follow-up, although no differences between conditions were found. Analyses of the QoL dimensions showed a significant improvement on the Anxiety/depression dimension compared to controls, but no effects were found in other dimensions. The results suggest that internet-delivered interventions has the potential to produce changes in QoL. These results can potentially be understood by the lower impairments within a mild to moderate depressed sample. Further inferences about the sensitivity of the EQ-5D measure within this population are discussed in light of the findings.

Patients in rural areas can access CBT via the internet. The effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has been consistently shown, but no clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of ICBT with real-time therapist support via videoconference for OCD, PD, and SAD at the same time. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of videoconference-delivered CBT for patients with OCD, PD, or SAD. Methods: A total of 30 Japanese participants (mean age 35.4 years, SD 9.2) with OCD, SAD, or PD received 16 sessions of individualized videoconference-delivered CBT with real-time support of a therapist, using tablet personal computer (Apple iPad Mini 2). Treatment involved individualized CBT formulations specific to the presenting diagnosis; all sessions were provided by the same therapist. The primary outcomes were reduction in symptomatology, using the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) for OCD, Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) for PD, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) for SAD. The secondary outcomes included the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) for Quality of Life, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety, and Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-SF). All primary outcomes were assessed at baseline and at weeks 1 (baseline), 8 (midintervention), and 16 (postintervention) face-to-face during therapy. The occurrence of adverse events was observed after each session. For the primary analysis comparing between pre- and posttreatments, the participants’ points and 95% CIs were estimated by the paired t tests with the change between pre- and posttreatment. Results: A significant reduction in symptom of obsession-compulsion (Y-BOCS = −6.2; Cohen d = 0.74; 95% CI −9.4 to −3.0, P = .002), panic (PDSS = −5.6; Cohen d = 0.89; 95% CI −9.83 to −1.37; P = .02), social anxiety (LSAS = −33.6; Cohen d = 1.10; 95% CI −59.62 to −7.49, P = .02) were observed. In addition, depression (PHQ-9 = −1.72; Cohen d = 0.27; 95% CI −3.26 to −0.19; P = .03) and general anxiety (GAD-7 = −3.03; Cohen d = 0.61; 95% CI −4.57 to −1.49, P &lt; .001) were significantly improved. Although there were no significant changes at 16 weeks from baseline in EQ-5D (0.0336; Cohen d = -0.202; 95% CI −0.0198 to 0.00869; P = .21), there were high therapeutic alliance (ie, WAI-SF) scores (from 68.0 to 73.7) throughout treatment, which significantly increased (4.14; 95% CI 1.24 to 7.04; P = .007). Of the participants, 86% (25/29) were satisfied with videoconference-delivered CBT, and 83% (24/29) preferred videoconference-delivered CBT to face-to-face CBT. An adverse event occurred to a patient with SAD; the incidence was 3% (1/30). Conclusions: Videoconference-delivered CBT for patients with OCD, SAD, and SAD may be feasible and acceptable.

M.",PLoS ONE,,2017.7.13,Scholarly Journals,English,"Computer-based interventions target improvement of physical and emotional functioning in patients with chronic pain and functional somatic syndromes. However, it is unclear to what extent which interventions work and for whom. This systematic review and meta-analysis (registered at PROSPERO, 2016: CRD42016050839) assesses efficacy relative to passive and active control conditions, and explores patient and intervention factors. Controlled studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Pooled standardized mean differences by comparison type, and somatic symptom, health-related quality of life, functional interference, catastrophizing, and depression outcomes were calculated at post-treatment and at 6 or more months follow-up. Risk of bias was assessed. Sub-group analyses were performed by patient and intervention characteristics when heterogeneous outcomes were observed. Maximally, 30 out of 46 eligible studies and 3,387 participants were included per meta-analysis. Mostly, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapies were identified. Significantly higher patient reported outcomes were found in comparisons with passive control groups (standardized mean differences ranged between -.41 and -.18), but not in comparisons with active control groups ( SMD = -.26--.14). For some outcomes, significant heterogeneity related to patient and intervention characteristics. To conclude, there is a minority of good quality evidence for small positive average effects of computer-based (cognitive) behavior change interventions, similar to traditional modes. These effects may be sustainable. Indications were found as of which interventions work better or more consistently across outcomes for which patients. Future process analyses are recommended in the aim of better understanding individual chances of clinically relevant outcomes.

Recent studies indicate altered resting-state static functional connectivity (FC) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in subjects with IGD. Whereas static FC often provides information on functional changes in subjects with IGD, investigations of temporal changes in FC between the DLPFC and the other brain regions may shed light on the dynamic characteristics of brain function associated with IGD. Thirty subjects with IGD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) matched for age, gender and education status were recruited. Using the bilateral DLPFC as seeds, static FC and dynamic FC maps were calculated and compared between groups. Correlations between alterations in static FC and dynamic FC and clinical variables were also investigated within the IGD group. The IGD group showed significantly lower static FC between the right DLPFC and the left rolandic operculum while higher static FC between the right DLPFC and the left pars triangularis when compared to HCs. The IGD group also had significantly decreased dynamic FC between the right DLPFC and the left insula, right putamen and left precentral gyrus, and increased dynamic FC in the left precuneus. Moreover, the dynamic FC between the right DLPFC and the left insula was negatively correlated with the severity of IGD. Dynamic FC can be used as a powerful supplement to static FC, helping us obtain a more comprehensive understanding of large-scale brain network activity in IGD and put forward new ideas for behavioral intervention therapy for it.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. Cortical‐ventral striatum (VS) circuitry is a common target of psychobehavioral interventions in drug addiction, and cortical‐VS dysfunction has been reported in IGD; hence, the primary aim of the study was to investigate how the VS circuitry responds to psychobehavioral interventions in IGD. In a cross‐sectional study, we examined resting‐state functional connectivity of the VS in 74 IGD subjects (IGDs) and 41 healthy controls (HCs). In a follow‐up craving behavioral intervention (CBI) study, of the 74 IGD subjects, 20 IGD subjects received CBI (CBI+) and 16 IGD subjects did not (CBI−). All participants were scanned twice with similar time interval to assess the effects of CBI. IGD subjects showed greater resting‐state functional connectivity of the VS to left inferior parietal lobule (lIPL), right inferior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus, in positive association with the severity of IGD. Moreover, compared with CBI−, CBI+ showed significantly greater decrease in VS‐lIPL connectivity, along with amelioration in addiction severity following the intervention. These findings demonstrated that functional connectivity between VS and lIPL, each presumably mediating gaming craving and attentional bias, may be a potential biomarker of the efficacy of psychobehavioral intervention. These results also suggested that non‐invasive techniques such as transcranial magnetic or direct current stimulation targeting the VS‐IPL circuitry may be used in the treatment of Internet gaming disorders.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a group behavioral intervention combining reality therapy and mindfulness meditation in reducing decisional impulsivity and IGD severity. Twenty-five IGD and 21 healthy comparison (HC) young adults participated in baseline tests on the delay discounting and balloon analog risk tasks to measure intertemporal and risky decision-making respectively. Among them, 18 IGD subjects participated in the intervention and were tested again at the end of intervention, and 19 HC subjects without intervention were also tested twice within a similar time period. Results indicate that: (1) at baseline, IGD subjects showed greater intertemporal and risky decisional impulsivity than HC subjects; (2) After intervention, IGD subjects were decreased in delay discounting rate and IGD severity, but did not perform differently on decisional impulsivity in risky choices, as compared with baseline. These findings suggest that decisional impulsivity is a multifaceted behavioral construct and may serve as a possible therapeutic target for IGD. In addition, these results highlight the need for further research into the roles of different forms of decisional impulsivity in the shaping, maintenance, and remission of IGD.

Kobak, James C. Mundt and Betsy Kennard ( Annals of General Psychiatry , 2015[Dec], Vol 14[37]). In the original article, there was an error in Table 7. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-50628-001). Background: Rapid advances in information technology and telecommunications have resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of mobile devices and the internet to enhance and facilitate access to treatment. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an empirically based treatment that is well suited for enhancement by new technologies, particularly with youth. To facilitate the dissemination of this evidence-based treatment, we developed a technology-enhanced CBT intervention for the treatment of adolescent depression consisting of (1) online therapist training (2) in-session use of tablets for teaching clients CBT concepts and skills, and (3) text messaging for between session homework reminders and self-monitoring. Methods: Eighteen licensed clinicians (social workers n = 7, psychologists n = 9) were randomized to have their patients receive either the intervention (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Each clinician treated four adolescents for 12 weeks. Clinicians in the CBT arm completed an online tutorial on CBT treatment of adolescent depression, then received an iPad with access to patient education materials for teaching CBT concepts to patients during sessions. Individualized text messages were integrated into treatment for homework reminders, support, and outcomes measurement. Outcome measures included a 49-item multiple choice test for tutorial effectiveness; the system usability scale (SUS) for user satisfaction; quick inventory of depressive symptomatology–adolescent version (QIDS-A-Pat); and clinician and patient ratings on the therapeutic alliance scale for adolescents (TASA). Results: A significant increase in knowledge of CBT concepts was found after completing the tutorial, t (8) = 7.02, p &lt; 0.001. Clinician and patient ratings of user satisfaction were high for both the iPad teaching tools, and the text messaging. Ninety-five percent of teens said reviewing their text messages with their therapist was helpful, and all said they would use text messaging in treatment again. Ratings of the therapeutic alliance were higher in the CBT arm t (131) = 4.03, p = 0.001. A significant reduction in depression was found in both groups [ t (34) = 8.453, p &lt; 0.001 and t (29) = 6.67, p &lt; 0.001 for CBT and TAU, respectively). Clinical ratings of improvement were greater on all outcome measures for the CBT arm; however, none reached statistical significance. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranged from small (QIDS-A) to large (TASA). Conclusions: Results support the feasibility of this technology-enhanced CBT intervention as a means of improving CBT treatment of adolescent depression and may help address the critical shortage of therapists trained on empirically based treatments.

Methods: We recruited 119 adolescents and adults with IGD. We treated these participants for 6 weeks in three groups as follows: 44 participants were treated with bupropion SR (bupropion group), 42 participants were treated with escitalopram (escitalopram group), and 33 patients without any medication were observed in the community (observation group). At baseline and at the 6-week follow-up visit, all subjects were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, the Young Internet Addiction Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the ADHD Rating Scale, and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Scales. Results: Both the escitalopram group and the bupropion group showed improvement on all clinical symptom scales after 6 weeks of treatment compared to the observation group. Additionally, the bupropion group showed greater improvement on scores for the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, the Young Internet Addiction Scale, the ADHD Rating Scale, and the Behavioral Inhibition Scale than the escitalopram group. Conclusion: Both bupropion and escitalopram were effective in treating and managing IGD symptoms. Moreover, bupropion appeared to be more effective than escitalopram in improving attention and impulsivity in IGD patients. In addition, attention and impulsivity seem to be important for the management of IGD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

A case report,"Loo, Jiann Lin;Samad, Farah Deena Binti Abdul;Sidi, Hatta Bin;Thambu, Maniam",Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the standard treatments for treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBD). However, there is limited literature on the role of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with TRBD who fail to respond to ECT. Aim: To establish whether TRBD resistant to ECT may be successfully treated with CBT. Method: A case report of a patient with TRBD who achieved full functional recovery with CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy after failing to respond to ECT. Results: A 45 year-old male with diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy and bipolar II disorder presented with a third recurrence of a depressive episode. In view of poor response to the combination pharmacotherapy, he was diagnosed with TRBD and prescribed a full course of ECT. Failing that, he was then given CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy and achieved full functional recovery. Discussion: To date there is a lack of consensus on either the diagnostic criteria of TRBD or evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of TRBD. Adjunctive modafinil, pramipexole, tranylcypromine and vagus nerve stimulation have been tried but the response rate is variable. Family-focused treatment, group psychoeducation and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy have been tried in bipolar depression but more research is still required for TRBD patients that failed to respond to ECT. In conclusion, combination of CBT and pharmacotherapy is worth a try for TRBD patients who do not respond to ECT.

However, because IM interventions are multidimensional, it has been difficult to examine their effectiveness and mechanisms of action. Optimal assessment of IM intervention effects in the elderly should include a multifaceted approach, utilizing advanced analytic methods to integrate psychological, behavioral, physiological, and biomolecular measures of a patient's response to IM treatment. Research is presented describing methods for collecting and analyzing psychological data; wearable unobtrusive devices for monitoring heart rate variability, activity and other behavioral responses in real time; immunochemical methods for noninvasive molecular biomarker analysis, and considerations and analytical approaches for the integration of these measures. The combination of methods and devices presented in this review will provide new approaches for evaluating the effects of IM interventions in real-life ambulatory settings of older adults, and will extend the concept of mobile health to the domains of IM and healthy aging.

10.1089/cyber.2013.0690,Using a digital game for training desirable behavior in cognitive–behavioral therapy of burnout syndrome: A controlled study,"Zielhorst, Thomas;van den Brule, Daphne;Visch, Valentijn;Melles, Marijke;van Tienhoven, Sam;Sinkbaek, Helle;Schrieken, Bart;Tan, Eduard S.-H.;Lange, Alfred","Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Burnout is a globally increasing illness, and as a result, many forms of burnout therapy have arisen. The use of digital games can be psychotherapeutically effective because they can transform exercises that are by themselves unattractive into intrinsically motivated action. This pilot study aims to test whether a specially designed game contributes to patients learning desired behavior and achieving other specific therapeutic goals in an online cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT)-based burnout treatment context. In total, 101 participants took part in the experiment, under four conditions: (a) Game + Therapy, (b) Therapy Only, (c) Game Only, and (d) No Game + No Therapy. Pre- and postmeasures were taken online. Results showed that the two therapy conditions (Game + Therapy and Therapy Only) showed a greater decrease in complaints and disengagement, and a stronger increase in coping skills than the nontherapy conditions (Game Only and No Game + No Therapy). As expected, the Game + Therapy condition outperformed the Therapy Only condition on combined improvement measures of burnout symptoms. However, analyses of individual measures showed no effects. It can be cautiously concluded that the therapeutic digital game may be a useful tool when embedded in a therapeutic burnout treatment program and is probably more efficient than CBT, as it is used in current practice.

Three MATS interventions were developed to target medication adherence, socialization, and auditory hallucinations. Participants received up to 840 text messages over a 12-week intervention period. Fifty-five consumers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were enrolled, but 13 consumers with more severe negative symptoms, lower functioning,and lower premorbid IQ did not complete the intervention, despite repeated prompting and training. For completers, the average valid response rate for 216 outcome assessment questions over the 12-week period was 86%, and 86% of phones were returned undamaged. Medication adherence improved significantly, but only for individuals who were living independently. Number of social interactions increased significantly and a significant reduction in severity of hallucinations was found. In addition, the probability of endorsing attitudes that could interfere with improvement in these outcomes was also significantly reduce din MATS. Lab-based assessments of more general symptoms and functioning did not change significantly. This pilot study demonstrated that low-intensity text-messaging interventions like MATS are feasible and effective interventions to improve several important outcomes, especially for higher functioning consumers with schizophrenia.

10.1016/j.jad.2025.04.100,Effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy with virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder: A randomized controlled trial in Hong Kong,"Pan, Jia-Yan;Thew, Graham R.;Clark, David M.",Journal of Affective Disorders,,2024.9.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common but under-treated mental health condition. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) are effective treatment approaches for SAD. However, few studies have integrated both, particularly in Chinese communities. This study examines the effectiveness of a 14-week iCBT program that includes VRET, called “Ease Anxiety in Social Event Online” (Ease Online), among Hong Kong adults with SAD. Method: 329 Hong Kong Chinese adults with SAD were randomized into web-based iCBT with VRET ( n = 117), app-based iCBT with VRET ( n = 111), or waitlist control (WLC) ( n = 101) groups. The mean age was 30.49 years old (SD = 9.34), with 36 % male and 64 % female. Assessments were administered at pre-test, post-test, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure was the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Data were analysed by using linear regression and mixed effects models. Results: Both treatment groups were superior to WLC group on both the primary and secondary outcome measures. The effects were comparable between the two iCBT formats. Improvements were maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The rate of reliable improvement based on the SPIN was 34 % and 40 % in the web-based and app-based iCBT groups, respectively, compared to 11 % in the WLC group; and 15 % and 23 % who meet the criteria for remission of social anxiety, compared to 3 % in the WLC group. Conclusions: Both web- and app-based iCBT with VRET are effective for Hong Kong Chinese adults with SAD. The EASE Online iCBT programme is an effective treatment approach for Hong Kong Chinese with SAD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1111/jsr.14363,Smartphone application‐delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia with telephone support for insomnia disorder compared to a waitlist control: A randomised clinical trial,"Jansson‐Fröjmark, Markus;Sunnhed, Rikard",Journal of Sleep Research,,2024.5.2,Scholarly Journals,English,"Although there have been promising findings for smartphone application (app)‐delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I), previous trials have not screened participants rigorously for insomnia disorder and used therapist support. Based on the above, we aimed to examine the effects of smartphone app‐delivered CBT‐I with telephone support against a waitlist (WL) in a sample with insomnia disorder. A total of 64 participants with insomnia disorder were randomised to smartphone app‐delivered CBT‐I ( n = 32) or a WL ( n = 32). Smartphone app‐delivered CBT‐I consisted of six weekly smartphone app modules with 15 min of telephone support per week. At pre‐ and post‐treatment, and the 3‐month follow‐up, we assessed insomnia symptoms and associated correlates and consequences. At post‐treatment, we also assessed measures related to adherence (therapist support, exercise/module completion), self‐rated perception of treatment content, activity, and adverse events. CBT‐I significantly outperformed the WL with large effects on the primary outcome ( d = 2.26) and was significantly different on most of the secondary outcomes with medium to large effects. CBT‐I also resulted in a significantly larger proportion of treatment remitters (CBT‐I: 64.5–77.4%, WL: 6.5–6.9%) and responders (CBT‐I: 77.4–90.3%, WL: 19.4–24.1%) at post‐treatment and follow‐up, compared to the WL. Treatment was associated with high satisfaction, high adherence, low attrition, and few treatment‐impeding adverse events. Based on the medium to large effects of smartphone app‐delivered CBT‐I with telephone support, this trial highlights the potential of delivering CBT‐I exclusively through an app with therapist telephone support for high efficacy, satisfaction, and adherence.

10.2196/69320,App-based ecological momentary assessment of problematic smartphone use during examination weeks in university students: 6-week observational study,"Ahn, Ji Seon;Jeong, InJi;Park, Sehwan;Lee, Jooho;Jeon, Minjeong;Lee, Sangil;Do, Gangho;Jung, Dooyoung;Park, Jin Young",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2024.11.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The increasing prevalence of problematic smartphone use (PSU) among university students is raising concerns, particularly as excessive smartphone engagement is linked to negative outcomes such as mental health issues, academic underperformance, and sleep disruption. Despite the severity of PSU, its association with behaviors such as physical activity, mobility, and sociability has received limited research attention. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), including passive data collection through digital phenotyping indicators, offers an objective approach to explore these behavioral patterns. Objective: This study aimed to examine associations between self-reported psychosocial measures; app-based EMA data, including daily behavioral indicators from GPS location tracking; and PSU in university students during the examination period. Methods: A 6-week observational study involving 243 university students was conducted using app-based EMA on personal smartphones to collect data on daily behaviors and psychosocial factors related to smartphone overuse. PSU was assessed using the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale. Data collected from the Big4+ app, including self-reports on mood, sleep, and appetite, as well as passive sensor data (GPS location, acceleration, and steps) were used to evaluate overall health. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that significantly influenced smartphone overuse, providing insights into daily behavior and mental health patterns. Results: In total, 23% (56/243) of the students exhibited PSU. The regression analysis revealed significant positive associations between PSU and several factors, including depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; odds ratio [OR] 8.48, 95% CI 1.95-36.87; P = .004), social interaction anxiety (Social Interaction Anxiety Scale; OR 4.40, 95% CI 1.59-12.15; P = .004), sleep disturbances (General Sleep Disturbance Scale; OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.15-10.30; P = .03), and longer sleep duration (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.14-8.48; P = .03). Conversely, a significant negative association was found between PSU and time spent at home (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.94; P = .04). Conclusions: This study suggests that negative self-perceptions of mood and sleep, along with patterns of increased mobility identified through GPS data, increase the risk of PSU, particularly during periods of academic stress. Combining psychosocial assessments with EMA data offers valuable insights for managing PSU during high-stress periods, such as examinations, and provides new directions for future research.

10.1016/j.beth.2024.05.010,A pilot open trial of a text message safety behavior fading intervention for appearance concerns among women,"Patel, Tapan A.;Cougle, Jesse R.",Behavior Therapy,,2023.10.13,Scholarly Journals,English,"Appearance concerns are a key feature in body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders, and they have been found to be a common feature of social anxiety disorder. Given the lack of transdiagnostic treatments for appearance concerns, we developed a preliminary text-based intervention targeting appearance-related safety behaviors (ARSBs; i.e., maladaptive behavioral strategies that seek to mitigate the feared consequences of the evaluation of appearance). The intervention utilized a daily text-message protocol where individuals are asked to fade their behaviors, provided encouragement, and log ARSB use in the past day. We evaluated the efficacy of ARSB fading in two successive cohorts of women with elevated appearance concerns (Study 1 N = 38, Study 2 N = 39). We found that across both studies participants experienced large reductions in appearance concerns (d = .93–1.36) and eating disorder symptoms (d = 1.06–1.20) that were maintained 1 month after treatment. Further, participants experienced small-to-medium reductions in social anxiety (d = 0.38–0.58) and depression (d = 0.52–0.96) from pre- to posttreatment. Notably, there were missing data in both studies (31%–50%), but multiple imputation was used to observe stability of effects. We also collected and incorporated feedback on the treatment to optimize the treatment before conducting the second trial. While these changes did not lead to significant differences in study outcomes, the second cohort demonstrated greater adherence to treatment and found the treatment to be more credible than the first cohort. Further, we found that greater baseline ARSBs predicted greater pre- to follow-up changes in appearance concerns. Taken together, text-based ARSB fading appears to be a promising treatment, and further research on the treatment appears warranted.

10.1002/eat.24079,Effectiveness of web‐based guided self‐help cognitive behavioral therapy‐enhanced for binge‐eating disorder: An implementation study,"Melisse, Bernou;van den Berg, Elske;de Beurs, Edwin",International Journal of Eating Disorders,,2023.6.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction Web‐based guided self‐help cognitive behavioral therapy‐enhanced (CBT‐E) is a 12‐weeks, 12‐sessions, digitalized version of part II of the self‐help book Overcoming Binge Eating . This intervention is effective when offered under controlled circumstances in a randomized‐controlled‐trial. It is unknown how patients with binge‐eating disorder (BED) respond to this intervention when offered in real‐world clinical‐settings. The aim of this study is to examine post‐intervention effectiveness of guided self‐help CBT‐E for BED in real‐world settings. Method The present study used a cohort‐design examining the effectiveness of web‐based guided self‐help CBT‐E according to an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis. BED patients ( n = 278) were assessed pre‐ and post‐intervention. The primary outcome was reduction in binge‐eating episodes. Other outcomes were full‐recovery (EDE‐Q score &lt;2.77 and abstinence from binge‐eating episodes), impaired psychosocial functioning, defined as secondary impairment, and general psychopathology post‐intervention. Results The number of binge‐eating episodes reduced by an average of 16 binge‐eating episodes per 4 weeks pre‐intervention to five binge‐eating episodes during the last 4 weeks of treatment. Abstinence from binge eating was reported by 30%, and 28% reported full recovery. Effect sizes (Cohen's d ) were large ( d ≥ 1.0) for all outcome measures. There were no differences in outcomes between the ITT and the completers sample. Discussion Guided self‐help CBT‐E is associated with significant improvements. The effects of guided self‐help CBT‐E offered in a real‐world‐setting are comparable to self‐help CBT‐E offered in a randomized‐controlled‐trial. However, it should be noted that comparisons with randomized‐controlled‐trials requires caution. Longer‐term follow‐up data are necessary to measure persistence of treatment benefits. Public Significance Offering CBT‐E as a web‐based guided self‐help intervention has several benefits for patients with BED. Guided self‐help CBT‐E is associated with significant improvements on the short term when offered in real‐world clinical settings.

10.1017/S1352465823000516,The impact of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for perfectionism: A reinterpretation through the lens of the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism,"Gaudreau, Patrick;Schellenberg, Benjamin J. I.",Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy,,2023.2.22,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Grieve et al. (2022) tested the effects of an intervention designed to reduce perfectionism. Contrary to their hypotheses, the intervention reduced both perfectionism and excellencism. Furthermore, excellencism positively correlated with negative outcomes (e.g. anxiety). Aims: A theory-driven framework (with five hypothetical scenarios) is proposed to reconsider how we interpret the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce perfectionism. Our goal was to offer a constructive reinterpretation of the results of Grieve et al. (2022) using our new framework derived from the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism. Method: Secondary data analyses using the experimental and correlational results are published in the randomized control trial of Grieve et al. (2022). Results: Our re-examination of the results reveals that excellencism was reduced by a smaller extent (approximately 25% less) than perfectionism. Based on our framework, such a ratio provides conclusive evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention. Students entered the intervention as perfectionists and they ended up somewhere between the zones of excellence striving and non-perfectionism. Furthermore, our multivariate re-analysis of the bivariate correlations indicates that excellence strivers experienced better adjustment (lower anxiety, depression, stress, body-related acceptance, and higher self-compassion) compared with perfectionists. Conclusion: Future interventions should target the reduction of perfectionism and the maintenance of excellencism because excellencism relates to desirable outcomes. Our secondary data analysis was needed to inform researchers and practitioners about an alternative interpretation of Grieve and colleagues’ findings. Future interventions to reduce perfectionism should closely monitor excellencism and follow the interpretational guidelines advanced in this article.

10.2196/48896,Use of e-cigarettes in cigarette smoking cessation: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"Santiago-Torres, Margarita;Mull, Kristin E.;Sullivan, Brianna M.;Bricker, Jonathan B.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2023.5.10,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Many adults use e-cigarettes to help them quit cigarette smoking. However, the impact of self-selected use of e-cigarettes on cigarette smoking cessation, particularly when concurrently receiving app-based behavioral interventions, remains unexplored. Objective: This study used data from a randomized trial of 2 smartphone apps to compare 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates between participants who used e-cigarettes on their own (ie, adopters: n = 465) versus those who did not (ie, nonadopters: n = 1097). Methods: The study population included all participants who did not use e-cigarettes at baseline. “Adopters” were those who self-reported the use of e-cigarettes at either 3- or 6-month follow-ups. “Nonadopters” were those who self-reported no use of e-cigarettes at either follow-up time point. The primary cessation outcome was self-reported, complete-case, 30-day point prevalence abstinence from cigarette smoking at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were missing-as-smoking and multiple imputation analyses of the primary outcome, prolonged abstinence, and cessation of all nicotine and tobacco products at 12 months. In logistic regression models, we first examined the potential interaction between e-cigarette use and treatment arm (iCanQuit vs QuitGuide) on the primary cessation outcome. Subsequently, we compared 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates between adopters and nonadopters separately for each app. Results: There was suggestive evidence for an interaction between e-cigarette use and treatment arm on cessation ( P = .05). In the iCanQuit arm, 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates were significantly lower among e-cigarette adopters compared with nonadopters (41/193, 21.2% vs 184/527, 34.9%; P = .003; odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.81). In contrast, in the QuitGuide arm, 12-month cigarette smoking cessation rates did not differ between adopters and nonadopters (46/246, 18.7% vs 104/522, 19.9%; P = .64; odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.62-1.35). Conclusions: The use of e-cigarettes while concurrently receiving an app-based smoking cessation intervention was associated with either a lower or an unimproved likelihood of quitting cigarette smoking compared to no use. Future behavioral treatments for cigarette smoking cessation should consider including information on the potential consequences of e-cigarette use.

This has not been explored for one-to-one internet-delivered therapy or functional impairment trajectories. Patients experiencing depression or anxiety received cognitive-behavioural therapy with a therapist using an online chat platform (N = 52,029). Trajectory classes of depression symptoms (PHQ9), anxiety symptoms (GAD7) and functional impairment (WSAS) were investigated using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial regressions tested associations between baseline variables and trajectory class. A four-class trajectory model was selected for each outcome, and these were highly similar. Each outcome showed three classes with initially moderate-severe symptoms or impairment: one demonstrated no change, one gradual improvement and one fast improvement. A fourth class had mild baseline scores and minimal improvement. In the moderate-severe classes, patients in the two with improvement were more likely to be employed and not to have obsessive-compulsive disorder. Fast improvement was likelier than gradual improvement or no change for patients with older age, no disability (e.g., physical, learning), or lower comorbid symptom or impairment scores. Associations with functional impairment classes were more similar to associations with depression classes than anxiety classes. Results were largely consistent with findings from face-to-face therapy. This study is an important step towards personalising therapy in terms of suitability and continuation.

10.2196/45414,Usage and daily attrition of a smartphone-based health behavior intervention: Randomized controlled trial,"Egilsson, Erlendur;Bjarnason, Ragnar;Njardvik, Urdur",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2022.12.29,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Although most adolescents have access to smartphones, few of them use mobile health (mHealth) apps for health improvement, highlighting the apparent lack of interest in mHealth apps among adolescents. Adolescent mHealth interventions have been burdened with high attrition rates. Research on these interventions among adolescents has frequently lacked detailed time-related attrition data alongside analysis of attrition reasons through usage. Objective: The objective was to obtain daily attrition rates among adolescents in an mHealth intervention to gain a deeper understanding of attrition patterns, including the role of motivational support, such as altruistic rewards, through analysis of app usage data. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 304 adolescent participants (152 boys and 152 girls) aged 13-15 years. Based on 3 participating schools, participants were randomly assigned to control, treatment as usual (TAU), and intervention groups. Measures were obtained at baseline, continuously throughout the 42-day trial period (research groups), and at the trial end. The mHealth app is called SidekickHealth and is a social health game with the following 3 main categories: nutrition, mental health, and physical health. Primary measures were attrition based on time from launch, and the type, frequency, and time of health behavior exercise usage. Outcome differences were obtained through comparison tests, while regression models and survival analyses were used for attrition measures. Results: Attrition differed significantly between the intervention and TAU groups (44.4% vs 94.3%; χ²₁ = 61.220; P &lt; .001). The mean usage duration was 6.286 days in the TAU group and 24.975 days in the intervention group. In the intervention group, male participants were active significantly longer than female participants (29.155 vs 20.433 days; χ²₁ = 6.574; P &lt; .001). Participants in the intervention group completed a larger number of health exercises in all trial weeks, and a significant decrease in usage was observed from the first to second week in the TAU group (t₁₀₅ = 9.208; P &lt; .001) but not in the intervention group. There was a significant increase in health exercises in the intervention group from the fifth to sixth week (t₁₀₅ = 3.446; P &lt; .001). Such a significant increase in usage was not evident in the TAU group. The research group was significantly related to attrition time (hazard ratio 0.308, 95% CI 0.222-0.420), as well as the numbers of mental health exercises ( P &lt; .001) and nutrition exercises ( P &lt; .001). Conclusions: Differences in attrition rates and usage between groups of adolescents were identified. Motivational support is a significant factor for lowering attrition in adolescent mHealth interventions. The results point to sensitivity periods in the completion of diverse health tasks, and emphasis on time-specific attrition, along with the type, frequency, and time of health behavior exercise usage, is likely a fruitful avenue for further research on mHealth interventions for adolescent populations, in which attrition rates remain excessive.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-17222-003). Background: Prevention of perinatal depression beginning from the antenatal period is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of recently developed internet‐delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for preventing the onset of a major depressive episode (MDE) in the third trimester and at 3 months postpartum. Methods: This is a two‐arm, parallel‐group, general‐information controlled, randomized controlled trial. Participants were 5017 pregnant women at 16–20 weeks' gestation without MDE at baseline. They were randomly assigned to an iCBT (intervention; n = 2509) or general‐information (control; n = 2508) group, stratified by psychological distress at baseline. The primary outcomes were the numbers of new MDE onsets, measured using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0, at 32 weeks' gestation and at 3 months postpartum. Results: New MDE onset was reported by 59 participants (2.35%) in the intervention group and 73 (2.91%) in the control group during follow‐up. Compared with the control group, the hazard ratio (HR) of MDE in the intervention group was 0.85 (95% CI 0.61–1.20), which was not significantly different. Among participants who scored between 5 and 8 on K6 at baseline, 10 (1.37%) in the intervention group reported new onset of MDE, compared with 28 (3.81%) in the control group, and the HR of MDE was 0.38 (95%CI 0.19–0.79). Conclusions: No intervention effect was found for iCBT in preventing new onset of perinatal MDE. iCBT might prevent perinatal depression only among pregnant women with subthreshold depressive symptoms.

10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.09.003,Effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety and depression symptoms in cancer patients: A meta-analysis,"Liu, Tingting;Xu, Juan;Cheng, Hui;Zhang, Yueyue;Wang, Shaotong;Lin, Lu;Tian, Li",General Hospital Psychiatry,,2022.8.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Purpose: This meta-analysis was to critically evaluate the effects of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) on the symptoms of anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Methods: Eight Chinese and English databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched from the inception of databases to May 2022 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). According to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and extract data from included studies. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.4. Results: Thirteen qualified studies were included in the meta-analysis, twelve of which reported the effect of ICBT on anxiety in 2079 cancer patients; thirteen of the studies reported the effect of ICBT on depression in 2179 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that ICBT was effective in improving anxiety [SMD = -0.37, 95%CI (−0.62, −0.12), P &lt; 0.01, I² = 86%] and depression [SMD = -0.27, 95%CI (−0.44, −0.09), P &lt; 0.01, I² = 72%] symptoms in cancer patients, especially those undergoing anti-cancer treatment. Therapist-guided ICBT was more effective than self-directed ICBT. ICBT lasting for ≤12 weeks could relieve anxiety and depressive symptoms of cancer patients. ICBT with number of modules ≥5 had a small effect on anxiety and depression relief while ICBT with number of modules &lt;5 was found to be ineffective. Conclusions: ICBT lasting for ≤12 weeks, especially therapist-directed, helps relieve the anxiety and depressive symptoms of cancer patients. The ideal number of modules for ICBT and its long-term efficacy need to be validated by more studies of higher-quality.

10.1111/psyg.12856,Effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy app developed for care workers involved in elderly care,"Takeda, Shinya;Fukuzaki, Toshiki;Nakayama, Shigeki",Psychogeriatrics,,2022.2.3,Scholarly Journals,English,"The article presents a study which seeks to create and examine the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral therapy-based app that care workers can quickly and easily use at home on a tablet device. The study participants were six care workers (two men and four women; mean age 50.3± 11.4 years) who work for a social welfare corporation and provide home visit care to elderly people. The app consisted of five modules. The first module comprised a task to enable participants to gain an understanding of the correspondence between thoughts and moods. The second module comprised a task to enable participants to notice negative moods, in which participants looked back on their day and selected the mood they felt most strongly from among the nine negative moods. The third module comprised a task which enabled participants to notice the thoughts that came into their minds, in which participants were asked to put in those thoughts when they were experiencing a negative mood. The app displayed suggestions for typical examples of thoughts corresponding to each mood. The fourth module comprised a task which enabled participants to find rational ways of thinking, in which participants were asked to think of and put in rational thoughts that were different from negative thoughts by thinking about them from a different perspective. The app displayed suggestions for rational thoughts corresponding to each of the moods. The fifth module comprised a task that enabled participants to think about behaviors that they could implement that would make the next day more pleasant. The app provided suggestions for four different ways of thinking about pleasant activities, such as: simple actions, specific actions, things that you want to do instead of things that you ‘should’ do, and actions that match up with your values. The results suggest the app developed in the present study may be effective in reducing cognitive distortion among care workers. Cognitive distortion has been shown to be associated with depressive symptoms and problems with social adaptation. The app reduced levels of cognitive distortion in general, which indicates it may be useful as a tool to support the mental health and workplace adaptation of care workers. However, no reduction in the stress response of care workers was observed after using the app. Stress responses would decrease after cognitive distortion has been reduced. Future research should therefore examine the long-term effects of this app, in order to evaluate the effect on stress responses associated with reductions in cognitive distortion.

Mental health problems can seriously impact students' functioning, interpersonal relationships, and academic achievement. Actively reaching out to college students with mental health problems and offering them internet-based interventions may be a promising way of providing low-threshold access to evidence-based treatment in colleges. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) in treating college students with depression and/or anxiety symptoms. Through an online survey that screened college students’ mental health, we recruited 100 college students aged ≥18 years who reported mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety symptoms and were attending colleges in the Netherlands. Participants were randomly allocated to guided iCBT (n = 48) or treatment as usual (TAU) control (n = 52). Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety measured at post-treatment (7 weeks post-randomization). We also measured all outcomes at 6- and 12-months post-randomization. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle and were repeated using the complete-case sample. We found no evidence of a difference between the effects of guided iCBT and TAU in any of the examined outcomes (i.e., symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, educational achievement, and college dropout) across all time points (p &gt; .05). There was no evidence that effects of iCBT were associated with treatment satisfaction and adherence. More research into transdiagnostic individually tailored iCBT is necessary. Further, future studies should recruit larger samples to investigate possible smaller but clinically relevant effects of internet-based interventions for college students with depression and/or anxiety.

10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.3491,Errors in relative risks reported in figure 3 in a network meta-analysis of cognitive behavior therapy delivery formats in adults with depression,"Cuijpers, Pim;Noma, Hisashi;Furukawa, Toshi A.",JAMA Psychiatry,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Reports an error in ""Effectiveness and Acceptability of Cognitive Behavior Therapy Delivery Formats in Adults With Depression: A Network Meta-Analysis"" by P. Cuijpers, H. Noma, E. Karyotaki, A. Cipriani and T. A. Furukawa ( JAMA Psychiatry , 2019[Jul], Vol 76[7], 700-707). In the original article, Figure 3B was not represented correctly. In the original Figure 3B, the authors had shown the dropouts of care as usual over each of the treatment formats, instead of dropouts of the formats over care as usual. But Figure 3B supposed care as usual to be the common comparator, so the correct representation should give the dropouts of the various formats over care as usual. The authors therefore had to reverse the relative risks. Because of this adjustment, the authors had to change a number in the text and add a phrase for context, but none of these changes affect the interpretations or conclusions of the study. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-75735-005). [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 76(9) of JAMA Psychiatry (see record 2019-76057-018). In the original article, a column heading in Figure 3B was incorrect. The label given as “SMD(95%CI)” should have been “RR (95%CI).” This article was corrected online.] Importance: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute depression. However, whether CBT can be effectively delivered in individual, group, telephone-administered, guided self-help, and unguided self-help formats remains unclear. Objective: To examine the most effective delivery format for CBT via a network meta-analysis. Data Sources: A database updated yearly from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Literature search dates encompassed January 1, 1966, to January 1, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of CBT for adult depression. The 5 treatment formats were compared with each other and the control conditions (waiting list, care as usual, and pill placebo). Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines were used when extracting data and assessing data quality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity of depression and acceptability of the treatment formats. Results: A total of 155 trials with 15 191 participants compared 5 CBT delivery formats with 2 control conditions. In half of the studies (78 [50.3%]), patients met the criteria for a depressive disorder; in the other half (77 [49.7%]), participants scored above the cutoff point on a self-report measure. The effectiveness of individual, group, telephone, and guided self-help CBT did not differ statistically significantly from each other. These formats were statistically significantly more effective than the waiting list (standardized mean differences [SMDs], 0.87-1.02) and care as usual (SMDs, 0.47-0.72) control conditions as well as the unguided self-help CBT (SMDs, 0.34-0.59). In terms of acceptability (dropout for any reason), individual (relative risk [RR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09-1.89) and group (RR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.80) CBT were significantly better than guided self-help. Guided self-help was also less acceptable than being on a waiting list (RR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.75) and care as usual (RR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90). Sensitivity analyses supported the overall findings. Conclusions and Relevance: For acute symptoms of depression, group, telephone, and guided self-help treatment formats appeared to be effective interventions, which may be considered as alternatives to individual CBT; although there were few indications of significant differences in efficacy between treatments with human support, guided self-help CBT may be less acceptable for patients than individual, group, or telephone formats.

10.1159/000521302,"Effectiveness of an internet-based self-help intervention versus public mental health advice to reduce worry during the COVID-19 pandemic: A pragmatic, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial","Heckendorf, Hanna;Lehr, Dirk;Boß, Leif",Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics,,2021.7.16,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: The mental health burden for the general population due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been highlighted. Evidence on effective, easily accessible public health interventions to reduce worry, a major transdiagnostic risk-factor for, e.g., anxiety and depression, is scarce. Objective: In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, we aimed to assess whether an internet cognitive-behavioral self-help intervention could reduce worry more than public mental health advice in the general population. Methods: Eligible internet users above the age of 18 were recruited from the German general population and randomly assigned, to either get.calm-move.on (GCMO), a 10-day unguided, internet-based self-help intervention, or mental health advice waiting group (MHA-W, receiving officially endorsed mental health recommendations). The primary outcome was level of worry, using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), 2 weeks after randomization. Baseline assessment and 2-month and 6-month follow-ups were conducted. The trial was registered at the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00021153). Results: Between April 7, 2020 and December 11, 2020, we randomly assigned 351 individuals to receive either GCMO ( n = 175) or MHA-W ( n = 176). Participants receiving GCMO (PSWQ = 46.6; change –10.3) reported significantly less worrying at post-intervention ( F 1,219 = 12.9; p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.38) than MHA-W controls (PSWQ = 51.6; change –5.1). Improvements were also seen on most secondary outcomes, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, general well-being, resiliency, and emotion regulation skills. Improvements made from baseline were stable until the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: This internet-based self-help intervention providing cognitive-behavioral techniques to cope with the threatening pandemic situation is effective in reducing worry in the general population and should complement existing and potentially effective mental health recommendations.

10.1017/S1754470X22000095,A cognitive behavioural therapy smartphone app for adolescent depression and anxiety: Co-design of ClearlyMe,"Li, S. H.;Achilles, M. R.;Spanos, S.;Habak, S.;Werner-Seidler, A.;O'Dea, B.",the Cognitive Behaviour Therapist,,2021.11.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"Adolescence is associated with heightened vulnerability to symptoms of depression and anxiety. In-person and computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are effective treatment options, yet uptake and engagement remain low. Smartphone delivery of CBT offers an alternative, highly accessible method of delivering CBT. However, there is no freely available CBT smartphone application (app) specifically designed to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. The aim of this study was to design a new CBT smartphone app (ClearlyMe) that targets depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. We engaged in a rigorous co-design process with adolescents ( n = 36), parents ( n = 15), and mental health professionals ( n = 32). Co-design involved: (1) discovery of users’ needs, views and preferences by conducting focus groups, (2) defining app features through ideation workshops and user consultations, (3) designing therapeutic CBT content and visual features, and (4) testing prototypes. Users were involved at every step and the process was iterative, with findings carried forward to ensure continued refinement of concepts and features. We found a preference for vibrant, cheerful colours and illustrations and non-endorsement of gamification and chatbots, which contrasted with findings from other studies. Preferences were largely consistent between the three user groups. However, adolescents preferred an app that could be used autonomously without professional support, whereas mental health professionals desired a product for use as a therapy adjunct to support CBT skill development. The importance of co-design, and particularly the inclusion of all stakeholders throughout the entire co-design process, is discussed in relation to the design of ClearlyMe.

10.1093/sleep/zsab202,A step in the right direction: Making cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia more accessible to people diagnosed with cancer,"Garland, Sheila N.",Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Comments on an article by J. Savard et al. (see record 2022-60268-026). Savard et al. used a non-inferiority design to test whether the short- and long-term effects of a stepped care approach to deliver CBT-I (StepCBT-I) was not significantly worse than professionally administered treatment (StanCBT-I) in a cancer setting. Their CBT-I protocol was a 6-week intervention combining stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive restructuring, and sleep hygiene education. They found that StepCBT-I was not significantly inferior to StanCBT-I with overall reductions in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores of −8.16 and −9.24, respectively, and that these improvements were durable up to 1 year. Improvements were also observed on measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life. These reductions are consistent with the overall data for the efficacy of CBT-I 5, further strengthening the evidence for the use of CBT-I with those impacted by cancer. An important feature of the model tested by Savard et al. was that initial treatment was tailored based on symptom severity. Compared with a pure stepped care model where everyone starts out with the least intensive intervention and then moves upwards, this stratification allows patients to receive more timely delivery of the appropriate intensity of intervention. Another unique feature of the Savard et al. trial was that the treatment algorithm was able to adapt to the needs of the patient in cases where there was an incomplete therapeutic response to the lower-level intervention. The study by Savard et al. is a much-needed demonstration that a stepped care approach to treating insomnia in cancer survivors is effective and can make efficient use of limited resources.

A.;Glikmann-Johnston, Yifat;Loy, Clement;Bellgrove, Mark A.;Stout, Julie C.;Andrews, Sophie C.",Neuropsychology,,2020.11.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate how sleep and physical activity habits related to cognitive functioning, in naturalistic settings, in early Huntington’s disease (HD). Method: Forty-two participants with the expanded HD repeat (20 manifest, 22 premanifest) and 29 healthy controls wore Fitbit One sleep and activity monitors for 7 days and 7 nights. They used a smartphone application to complete daily sleep and activity diaries, sleep and mood inventories, and a brief battery of cognitive tests, which were completed on Day 8 of the study. All data were collected in naturalistic home and community settings. Results: Amongst participants with the expanded HD repeat, greater time spent in bed, measured by Fitbit, was associated with poorer accuracy and response speed on a test of visual memory, whereas lower levels of physical activity, measured by Fitbit, were associated with poorer accuracy on a test involving a working memory component. Neither time in bed nor physical activity is associated with a test of psychomotor speed. Groups were mostly similar across a range of Fitbit and self-report measures of sleep and physical activity, although the Manifest-HD group spent more time in bed than the Premanifest-HD and Healthy Control groups and had better self-reported sleep quality and more self-reported time spent sitting than the Healthy Control group and the Premanifest-HD group, respectively. Conclusions: Sleep timing and physical activity relate to cognitive functioning in HD and may be important targets for management in behavioral intervention studies aimed at improving cognition in HD.

10.1002/da.23161,Depression subtypes and their response to cognitive behavioral therapy: A latent transition analysis,"Simmonds‐Buckley, Melanie;Catarino, Ana;Delgadillo, Jaime",Depression and Anxiety,,2020.12.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depression is a heterogeneous condition, with multiple possible symptom‐profiles leading to the same diagnosis. Descriptive depression subtypes based on observation and theory have so far proven to have limited clinical utility. Aim: To identify depression subtypes and to examine their time‐course and prognosis using data‐driven methods. Methods: Latent transition analysis was applied to a large ( N = 8380) multi‐service sample of depressed patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in outpatient clinics. Patients were classed into initial latent states based on their responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 of depression symptoms, and transition probabilities to other states during treatment were quantified. Qualitatively similar states were clustered into overarching depression subtypes and we statistically compared indices of treatment engagement and outcomes between subtypes using post hoc analyses. Results: Fourteen latent states were clustered into five depression subtypes: mild (2.7%), severe (9.8%), cognitive‐affective (23.7%), somatic (21.4%), and typical (42.4%). These subtypes had high temporal stability, and the most common transitions during treatment were from severe toward milder states within the same subtype. Differential response to treatment was evident, with the highest improvement rate (63.6%) observed in the cognitive‐affective subtype. Conclusion: Replicated evidence indicates that depression subtypes are temporally stable and associated with differential response to CBT.

In the Original Investigation, a technical error caused the surname of Frederic Maas genannt Bermpohl to be displayed incorrectly. The surname should have appeared as Maas genannt Bermpohl. This article was corrected online.] Importance: Personalized treatment choices would increase the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression to the extent that patients differ in interventions that better suit them. OBJECTIVE To provide personalized estimates of short-term and long-term relative efficacy of guided and unguided iCBT for depression using patient-level information. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published up to January 1, 2019. Study Selection: Eligible RCTs were those comparing guided or unguided iCBT against each other or against any control intervention in individuals with depression. Available individual patient data (IPD) was collected from all eligible studies. Depression symptom severity was assessed after treatment, 6 months, and 12 months after randomization. Data Extraction and Synthsis: We conducted a systematic review and IPD network meta-analysis and estimated relative treatment effect sizes across different patient characteristics through IPD network meta-regression. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) scores. Results: Of 42 eligible RCTs, 39 studies comprising 9751 participants with depression contributed IPD to the IPD network meta-analysis, of which 8107 IPD were synthesized. Overall, both guided and unguided iCBT were associated with more effectiveness as measured by PHQ-9 scores than control treatments over the short term and the long term. Guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT (mean difference [MD] in posttreatment PHQ-9 scores, −0.8; 95%CI, −1.4 to −0.2), but we found no evidence of a difference at 6 or 12 months following randomization. Baseline depression was found to be the most important modifier of the relative association for efficacy of guided vs unguided iCBT. Differences between unguided and guided iCBT in people with baseline symptoms of subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 scores 5-9) were small, while guided iCBT was associated with overall better outcomes in patients with baseline PHQ-9 greater than 9. Conclusions and Relevance: In this network meta-analysis with IPD, guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT for individuals with depression, benefits were more substantial in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Unguided iCBT was associated with similar effectiveness among individuals with symptoms of mild/subthreshold depression. Personalized treatment selection is entirely possible and necessary to ensure the best allocation of treatment resources for depression.

G.;Sylvén, Ylva Hägg;Sjöström, Jonas;Johansson, Birgitta;von Essen, Louise;Grönqvist, Helena",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2020.9.25,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Web-based interventions are effective for several psychological problems. However, recruitment, adherence, and missing data are challenges when evaluating these interventions. Objective: This study aimed to describe the use patterns during the commencement phase, possible retention patterns (continuation of data provision), and responses to prompts and reminders among participants in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating web-based interventions. Methods: Data on use patterns logged in 2 RCTs aiming to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression among adult patients recently diagnosed with cancer (AdultCan RCT) and patients with a recent myocardial infarction (Heart RCT) were analyzed. The web-based intervention in the AdultCan trial consisted of unguided self-help and psychoeducation and that in the Heart trial consisted of therapist-supported cognitive behavioral therapy. In total, 2360 participants’ use patterns at first log-in, including data collection at baseline (ie, commencement) and at 2 follow-ups, were analyzed. Both the intervention and comparison groups were analyzed. Results: At commencement, 70.85% (909/1283) and 86.82% (935/1077) of the participants in AdultCan and Heart RCTs, respectively, logged in and completed baseline data collection after receiving a welcome email with log-in credentials. The median duration of the first log-in was 44 minutes and 38 minutes in AdultCan and Heart RCTs, respectively. Slightly less than half of the participants’first log-ins were completed outside standard office hours. More than 80% (92/114 and 103/111) of the participants in both trials explored the intervention within 2 weeks of being randomized to the treatment group, with a median duration of 7 minutes and 47 minutes in AdultCan and Heart RCTs, respectively. There was a significant association between intervention exploration time during the first 2 weeks and retention in the Heart trial but not in the AdultCan trial. However, the control group was most likely to retain and provide complete follow-up data. Across the 3 time points of data collection explored in this study, the proportion of participants responding to all questionnaires within 1 week from the prompt, without a reminder, varied between 35.45% (413/1165) and 66.3% (112/169). After 2 reminders, up to 97.6% (165/169) of the participants responded. Conclusions: Most participants in both RCTs completed the baseline questionnaires within 1 week of receiving the welcome email. Approximately half of them answered questions at baseline data collection outside office hours, suggesting that the time flexibility inherent in web-based interventions contributes to commencement and use. In contrast to what was expected, the intervention groups generally had lower completion rates than the comparison groups. About half of the participants completed the questionnaires without a reminder, but thereafter, reminders contributed to both baseline and follow-up retention, suggesting they were effective. Strategies to increase commencement of and retention in eHealth interventions are important for the future development of effective interventions and relevant research.

10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.143,Self-guided online cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia: A naturalistic evaluation in patients with potential psychiatric comorbidities,"Grierson, A. B.;Hobbs, M. J.;Mason, E. C.",Journal of Affective Disorders,,2019.11.7,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder worldwide, and regularly co-occurs with anxiety and depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the gold standard treatment for insomnia (CBT-I), however demand for treatment providers drastically exceeds supply. Internet-delivered programs for insomnia (iCBT-I) improve treatment access. However the effects of unguided iCBT-I for individuals with comorbidities within a naturalistic setting remains unexplored. We developed a novel unguided iCBT-I program and evaluated its impact on insomnia, psychological distress, and wellbeing when accessed by the public. Methods: 317 participants experiencing insomnia for over 3 months enrolled in the program. The program consisted of 4 lessons delivered online with automated web support. Insomnia symptoms, psychological distress, and general wellbeing were assessed at lesson 1 and 4. Intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to examine effects on insomnia, distress, and wellbeing. Results: Participants experienced large ( g = 1.11) and significant reductions in insomnia, moderate ( g = 0.55) and significant reductions in distress, and small ( g = 0.37) but significant improvements in wellbeing. 65% of participants who reported pre-treatment insomnia severity at clinical levels remitted following treatment. Limitations: To examine the program in a naturalistic setting, we did not employ a control group or follow participants beyond the completion of treatment. Conclusions: Unguided iCBT-I is effective for individuals in the community who experience insomnia and are likely experiencing comorbid mental health problems. These effects in the absence of guided contact strengthen the utility of unguided iCBT-I as a scalable and cost-effective method of disseminating treatments for this disorder.

We aimed to investigate whether internet delivered cognitive-behaviour therapy (iCBT) could prevent depressive disorders in older adults with multimorbidity who were not currently depressed. Method: 302 primary care and community participants aged 65 years and over, who had multimorbidity but did not meet criteria for a depressive disorder were randomised to an intervention group who received an eight-week, five session iCBT ( n = 150) or to a control group ( n = 152) who received treatment as usual. Diagnostic interviews were conducted at baseline, and three and six months after the intervention period, where indicated, and the presence of depressive disorder was the primary outcome. Results: The intention to treat, chi-square analyses indicated there were significantly fewer cases of depressive disorder in the treatment group compared to the control group by six-month follow-up (χ²(1,302) = 5.21, p = .02). Limitations: The main limitations of this RCT are a short follow up period and low proportion of participants who developed depressive disorders. Participants were relatively well educated, with a majority having English as their first language. Conclusions: These results indicate that depressive disorder was prevented in the first six months following iCBT with three times the number of cases of depressive disorder in the control group compared to the treatment group. Further research is required to determine whether iCBT can be effective for preventing depressive disorder in this population over a longer time period.

The IAPT database collects routine session-by-session outcome monitoring data for this population, including outcomes for depression and anxiety in a stepped care model which includes a range of psychological therapies, among them Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Person-centred Experiential Therapy, known in the IAPT programme as Counselling for Depression (CfD). In 2017–18, 32% of all referrals were for anxiety and stress disorders, 26% for depression, and 35% were unspecified. The definition of treatment completion is receipt of 2 sessions or more and on this basis 60% of all referrals in 2017–18 did not complete treatment, predominantly because they failed to attend the initial appointment, or ended after only one session. Four years of data on outcomes for CBT and CfD suggests these therapies are broadly comparable in terms of both recovery rate and average number of sessions, though the number of referrals to each therapy varied widely. Data on treatment choice and satisfaction was favourable but there were issues with low return rates and invalid data. Information on outcomes for ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and religion, as well as a measure of local economic deprivation, indicate lower outcomes for a number of patient groups. Data on employment status outcomes suggest little overall change, including for the category of those on benefits payments. The data published alongside the annual IAPT reports mean there is an increasing amount of information in the public domain about IAPT performance, but it is time consuming to extract and evaluate. This report highlights a number of points of concern which suggest the need for improvement on multiple axes. We suggest that improved researcher access to the huge IAPT dataset can allow for more detailed evaluations of IAPT that can inform policy/decision-making to improve outcomes for clients.

10.1111/ap.12383,Engagement with a cognitive behavioural therapy mobile phone app predicts changes in mental health and wellbeing: MoodMission,"Bakker, David;Rickard, Nikki",Australian Psychologist,,2018.9.15,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: There is an abundance of evidence supporting the efficacy of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), but few studies have evaluated mobile applications (apps) that provide CBT strategies. This study investigating the relationships between mental health outcomes and engagement with a mobile app that recommended short CBT strategies. Method: Participants downloaded the MoodMission app from the iOS and Android app stores, completed in-app baseline assessments, and final assessments 30 days later. Participants reported their mood to MoodMission when they were feeling low or anxious and received a list of short CBT strategies to choose from and engage in. Data from 617 assessment completers (71% female; M age = 27 years) were analysed via hierarchical and mediated regressions. Results: App engagement ratings predicted increases in mental wellbeing. Mediation analyses revealed that there were indirect effects of app engagement on depression, anxiety, and mental wellbeing via the mediator of coping self-efficacy. Subsample analyses found this only for participants who were experiencing a moderate level of depression or anxiety at the time of the baseline assessment. Conclusions: Engaging with an app that provides CBT strategies can increase mental wellbeing, and coping self-efficacy may mediate effects of the app in individuals experiencing moderate depression or anxiety.

The sentence given as “Guided self-help format ranked considerably lower than the other treatment formats (1.6%; RR=0.72)” should have presented the relative risk as 1.39, followed by the phrase “increasing dropouts in comparison with care as usual.”In addition, the label of Figure 3B given as “Acceptability” should have been “Dropouts from study (acceptability).” The values for the forest plot of Figure 3B presented dropouts of care as usual over each of the treatment formats but should have presented dropouts of the various formats over care as usual. This article has been corrected. [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 79(2) of JAMA Psychiatry (see record 2023-11602-010). In the original article, Figure 3B was not represented correctly. In the original Figure 3B, the authors had shown the dropouts of care as usual over each of the treatment formats, instead of dropouts of the formats over care as usual. But Figure 3B supposed care as usual to be the common comparator, so the correct representation should give the dropouts of the various formats over care as usual. The authors therefore had to reverse the relative risks. Because of this adjustment, the authors had to change a number in the text and add a phrase for context, but none of these changes affect the interpretations or conclusions of the study.] [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 76(9) of JAMA Psychiatry (see record 2019-76057-018).

However, whether CBT can be effectively delivered in individual, group, telephone-administered, guided self-help, and unguided self-help formats remains unclear. Objective: To examine the most effective delivery format for CBT via a network meta-analysis. Data Sources: A database updated yearly from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Literature search dates encompassed January 1, 1966, to January 1, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of CBT for adult depression. The 5 treatment formats were compared with each other and the control conditions (waiting list, care as usual, and pill placebo). Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines were used when extracting data and assessing data quality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity of depression and acceptability of the treatment formats. Results: A total of 155 trials with 15 191 participants compared 5 CBT delivery formats with 2 control conditions. In half of the studies (78 [50.3%]), patients met the criteria for a depressive disorder; in the other half (77 [49.7%]), participants scored above the cutoff point on a self-report measure. The effectiveness of individual, group, telephone, and guided self-help CBT did not differ statistically significantly from each other. These formats were statistically significantly more effective than the waiting list (standardized mean differences [SMDs], 0.87-1.02) and care as usual (SMDs, 0.47-0.72) control conditions as well as the unguided self-help CBT (SMDs, 0.34-0.59). In terms of acceptability (dropout for any reason), individual (relative risk [RR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09-1.89) and group (RR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.80) CBT were significantly better than guided self-help....

10.1016/j.janxdis.2019.02.002,Preference trial of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy comparing standard weekly versus optional weekly therapist support,"Hadjistavropoulos, H. D.;Schneider, L. H.;Mehta, S.;Karin, E.;Dear, B. F.;Titov, N.",Journal of Anxiety Disorders,,2018.7.6,Scholarly Journals,English,"Emerging evidence from research trials suggests that Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) produces similar symptom improvements whether patients receive weekly therapist support ( standard support ) or therapist support only when requested ( optional support ). It remains unknown, however, how many patients receiving ICBT as part of routine clinical care would prefer optional support compared to standard support and how outcomes compare when patients select their preferred treatment option. In this uncontrolled trial, we investigated patient preference and outcomes for standard versus optional support among patients with depression and or anxiety who were offered an 8-week transdiagnostic ICBT intervention in routine care. Of 401 patients accepted for ICBT, 22% selected optional support and 78% selected standard support. At assessment, patients who selected optional support had lower symptoms of anxiety and panic than patients who selected standard support. At post-treatment, both groups achieved similar large improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression, with improvements sustained at 3-month follow-up. Patients receiving optional support sent and received fewer messages compared to patients receiving standard support. This study demonstrates the potential of optional therapist support to meet the needs and preferences of patients and to also reduce therapist costs in routine care.

10.1002/cpp.2341,Cognitive–behavioral therapy for Internet gaming disorder: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Stevens, Matthew W. R.;King, Daniel L.;Dorstyn, Diana;Delfabbro, Paul H.",Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy,,2018.7.17,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Although there is sufficient research and clinical evidence to support the inclusion of gaming disorder in the latest revision of the International Classification of Diseases, relatively little is known about the effectiveness of first‐line psychological treatment for gaming disorder or internet gaming disorder (IGD) as it is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. This systematic review employed meta‐analytic techniques to determine the effectiveness of cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) for IGD on four key outcomes: IGD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and time spent gaming. Method: A database search identified 12 independent CBT studies. Effect size estimates (Hedges' g) with associated confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and p values for each pre–post treatment outcome, were calculated. Study reporting quality was evaluated in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. Subgroup and moderator analyses were undertaken to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Results: CBT demonstrated high efficacy in reducing IGD symptoms ( g = 0.92; [0.50, 1.34]) and depression ( g = 0.80, [0.21, 1.38]), and showed moderate efficacy in reducing anxiety ( g = 0.55, [0.17, 0.93]) at post‐test. There was insufficient power to determine whether CBT was capable of reducing time spent gaming. Treatment gains at follow‐up were nonsignificant across the four treatment outcomes. Conclusions: The pooled findings suggest that CBT for IGD is an effective shortterm intervention for reducing IGD and depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness of CBT for reducing actual time spent gaming was unclear. Given the limitations of this evidence base, there is a need for more rigorous studies to determine the potential long‐term benefits of CBT for IGD. Public Health Significance Statement: Given the rise in treatment demand for internet gaming disorder (IGD) and problematic gaming, it is necessary to determine which treatments are most effective for whom and under which conditions. This review shows that cognitive‐behavioural therapy for IGD, which is often considered the first‐line therapy, can improve IGD symptoms and comorbid depression. However, treatment gains tend to be short‐term and their effect in reducing time spent gaming is unclear. Programs that target problematic gaming may be improved by additional support beyond the standard program of therapy sessions. More funding and resources are needed to support the development of a more rigorous evidence base on IGD and its treatment.

10.1016/j.cbpra.2018.07.002,Development and pilot evaluation of smartphone-delivered cognitive behavior therapy strategies for mood- and anxiety-related problems: MoodMission,"Bakker, David;Kazantzis, Nikolaos;Rickwood, Debra;Rickard, Nikki",Cognitive and Behavioral Practice,,2017.9.28,Scholarly Journals,English,"Given the ubiquity and interactive power of smartphones, there are opportunities to develop smartphone applications (apps) that provide novel, highly accessible mental health supports. This paper details the development of a smartphone app, “MoodMission,” that aims to provide evidence-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) strategies for mood- and anxiety-related problems, contributing to the prevention of clinically significant depression and anxiety disorders and serving as an adjunct to therapeutic interventions delivered by trained health professionals. MoodMission was designed to deliver strategies in the form of real-time, momentary responses to user-reported low moods and anxiety. The development process involved: (a) construction of a battery of strategies, (b) empirical evaluation, (c) a software and behavioral plan design and testing process, (d) user feedback, and (e) a public launch. A pilot study of 44 participants completed the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS; Hides et al., 2014) for usability testing and feedback. MoodMission was rated significantly higher than standardized health app norms on the majority of the domains, including Entertainment, Interest, Customization, Target Group, Graphics, Visual Appeal, Quality of Information, Quantity of Information, Visual Information, Credibility of Source, Recommendation to Use, Estimated Frequency of Use, and Overall Rating (Hedges’s g range 0.57–1.97, p &lt; .006). Case examples illustrate the practical uses of the app. In addition to clinical applications, MoodMission holds promise as a research tool either as an augmentation to clinician-delivered therapy, or as a vehicle for standardizing client access to specific CBT strategies (e.g., in studies intending to study different change processes).

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Web-based CBT blended with face-to-face sessions that reduce therapist time in patients with major depression who were unresponsive to antidepressant medications. Methods: A 12-week, assessor-masked, parallel-group, waiting- list controlled, randomized trial was conducted at 3 medical institutions in Tokyo. Outpatients aged 20-65 years with a primary diagnosis of major depression who were taking ≥ 1 antidepressant medications at an adequate dose for ≥ 6 weeks and had a 17-item GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of ≥ 14 were randomly assigned (1:1) to blended CBT or waiting-list groups using a computer allocation system, stratified by the study site with the minimization method, to balance age and baseline GRID-HAMD score. The CBT intervention was given in a combined format, comprising a Web-based program and 12 45-minute face-to-face sessions. Thus, across 12 weeks, a participant could receive up to 540 minutes of contact with a therapist, which is approximately two-thirds of the therapist contact time provided in the conventional CBT protocol, which typically provides 16 50-minute sessions. The primary outcome was the alleviation of depressive symptoms, as measured by a change in the total GRID-HAMD score from baseline (at randomization) to posttreatment (at 12 weeks). Moreover, in an exploratory analysis, we investigated whether the expected positive effects of the intervention were sustained during follow-up, 3 months after the posttreatment assessment. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, and the primary outcome was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Results: We randomized 40 participants to either blended CBT (n = 20) or waiting-list (n = 20) groups. All patients completed the 12-week treatment protocol and were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Participants in the blended CBT group had significantly alleviated depressive symptoms at week 12, as shown by greater least squares mean changes in the GRID-HAMD score, than those in the waiting list group (−8.9 points vs −3.0 points; mean between-group difference = −5.95; 95% CI −9.53 to −2.37; P &lt; .001). The follow-up effects within the blended CBT group, as measured by the GRID-HAMD score, were sustained at the 3-month follow-up (week 24) and posttreatment (week 12): posttreatment, 9.4 (SD 5.2), versus follow-up, 7.2 (SD 5.7); P = .009. Conclusions: Although our findings warrant confirmation in larger and longer term studies with active controls, these suggest that a combined form of CBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with major depression who are unresponsive to antidepressant medications.

10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00371,Internet game overuse is associated with an alteration of fronto-striatal functional connectivity during reward feedback processing,"Kim, Jinhee;Kang, Eunjoo",Frontiers in Psychiatry,,2018.3.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Internet gaming disorder is associated with abnormal reward processing in the reward circuit, which is known to interact with other brain regions during feedback learning. Kim et al. (1) observed that individuals with internet game overuse (IGO) exhibit altered behavior and neural activity for non-monetary reward, but not for monetary reward. Here, we extend our analysis of IGO to the functional connectivity of the reward network. Functional MRI data were obtained during a stimulus-response association learning task from 18 young males with IGO and 20 age-matched controls, where either monetary or non-monetary rewards were given as positive feedback for a correct response. Group differences in task-dependent functional connectivity were examined for the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum (VS), which are known for reward evaluation and hedonic response processing, respectively, using a generalized form of the psychophysiological interaction approach. For non-monetary reward processing, no differences in functional connectivity were found. In contrast, for monetary reward, connectivity of the vmPFC with the left caudate nucleus was weaker for the IGO group relative to controls, while vmPFC connectivity with the right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was elevated. The strength of vmPFC-NAcc functional connectivity appeared to be behaviorally relevant, because individuals with stronger vmPFC-NAcc connectivity showed lower learning rates for monetary reward. In addition, the IGO group showed weaker ventral striatum functional connectivity with various brain regions, including the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate regions, and left pallidum. Thus, for monetary reward, the IGO group exhibited stronger functional connectivity within the brain regions involved in motivational salience, whereas they showed reduced functional connectivity the widely distributed brain areas involved in learning or attention. These differences in functional connectivity of reward networks, along with related behavioral impairments of reward learning, suggest that internet gaming disorder is associated with the increased incentive salience or “wanting” of addiction disorders, and may serve as the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the impaired goal-directed behavior.

Anxiety and depressive disorders are highly prevalent in children and adolescents. Clinician-administered instruments, such as diagnostic and clinician-administered interviews and parent- and youth-report questionnaires, are the most commonly used methods to assess for anxiety and depression in youth. The latest research in the field has focused on innovative approaches to enhance CBT, and the personalization of treatment. To address difficulties in accessing treatment of youth, researchers have begun to evaluate the efficacy of computer-, Internet-, and mobile phone–delivered CBT, with promising outcomes to date. Over the past 20 years, considerable progress has been made in treating anxiety and depression using CBT in youth; however, with less than optimal remission rates, more is needed to improve outcomes for youth who fail to respond to the current best treatments.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with a random sample of 293 respondents aged from 13 to 24 years. Participants completed an online survey. Problematic gaming behavior was measured with the Game Addiction Scale (GAS). Self-reports covered health measures such as psychological health (psychopathological symptoms, satisfaction with life), social health (preferences for social interaction), and physical health (general health, Body Mass Index [BMI], body discomfort, physical activity). Results: Problematic gaming behavior was found to relate to psychological and health problems, namely fatigue, sleep interference, depression and anxiety symptoms. Multiple linear regression indicated that the amount of weekly gaming, depression and a preference for online social interaction predicted increased problematic gaming symptoms. Conclusions: This research emphasized that problematic gaming behavior had a strong negative correlation to a variety of subjective health outcomes.

Numerous challenges interfere with exercise participation in this high-risk group including mental health symptoms, low motivation, and limited access to safe and affordable options for physical activity. Wearable devices and mobile health technologies may afford new opportunities for promoting physical activity and supporting behavioral weight loss efforts. This exploratory study examined whether daily step count measured using Fitbit wearable devices was associated with weight loss and improved fitness among individuals with serious mental illness enrolled in a 6-month lifestyle program. Participants ( n = 34) had a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (23.5%), major depression (50.0%), or bipolar disorder (26.5%), and wore Fitbits most of the days (M = 86.2%; SD = 18.4%) they were enrolled in the study. At 6-months, higher average daily step count was associated with greater weight loss ( F = 5.07; df = 1,32; p = 0.0314), but not improved fitness ( F = 1.92; df = 1,31; p = 0.176). These findings demonstrate that encouraging participants with serious mental illness enrolled in lifestyle interventions to collect more steps may contribute to greater weight loss. This suggests that wearable devices may offer a feasible and potentially effective strategy for supporting behavioral weight loss in community mental health settings.

Behavioral interventions for smoking cessation yield modest benefits, particularly in lower socioeconomic groups. Pharmacotherapy, a first-line option for smoking cessation, has not shown clear benefits for pregnant smokers, partly due to limited adherence. We evaluated the feasibility of conducting a pharmacotherapy trial for smoking cessation in pregnant women, using text messaging to enhance medication adherence. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 724 predominantly minority pregnant women to examine the prevalence and correlates of smoking and the use of cellular telephones and text messaging. Results: Nearly 18% of the respondents were current smokers, with a majority (67.7%) expressing interest in participating in a smoking cessation trial. Only about 6% of women with a smoking history ever received nicotine dependence treatment. Smokers were significantly more likely to be depressed than nonsmokers. The vast majority of respondents (92.1%) owned cell phones, with 93.2% having an unlimited text messaging plan. Conclusions:These data support the feasibility of conducting a pharmacotherapy smoking cessation trial and using text messaging to enhance medication adherence in a predominantly minority population of pregnant smokers.

The correction is present in the erratum.] Purpose: To examine the relation between “sexting” (sending and sharing sexual photos online, via text messaging, and in person) with sexual risk behaviors and psychosocial challenge in adolescence. Methods: Data were collected online between 2010 and 2011 with 3,715 randomly selected 13- to 18-year-old youth across the United States. Results: Seven percent of youth reported sending or showing someone sexual pictures of themselves, in which they were nude or nearly nude, online, via text messaging, or in person, during the past year. Although females and older youth were more likely to share sexual photos than males and younger youth, the profile of psychosocial challenge and sexual behavior was similar for all youth. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, sharing sexual photos was associated with all types of sexual behaviors assessed (e.g., oral sex, vaginal sex) as well as some of the risky sexual behaviors examined—particularly having concurrent sexual partners and having more past-year sexual partners. Adolescents who shared sexual photos also were more likely to use substances and less likely to have high self-esteem than their demographically similar peers. Conclusions: Although the media has portrayed sexting as a problem caused by new technology, health professionals may be more effective by approaching it as an aspect of adolescent sexual development and exploration and, in some cases, risk-taking and psychosocial challenge.

Method: 25 residents with depression were randomized to GIST (n = 13) or TAU (n = 12). Outcome measures included geriatric depression scale-short form (GDS-S), life satisfaction index Z (LSI-Z), and subjective ratings of treatment satisfaction. The GIST group participated in 15 group sessions. TAU crossed over to GIST at the end of the treatment trial. Results: There were significant differences between GIST and TAU in favor of GIST on the GDS-S and LSI-Z. The GIST group maintained improvements over another 14 sessions. After crossover to GIST, TAU members showed significant improvement from baseline. Participants also reported high subjective ratings of treatment satisfaction. Discussion: This trial demonstrated GIST to be more effective for depression in LTC than standard treatments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1111/bjc.12517,Predictors of dropout in self‐guided internet‐delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for obsessive‐compulsive disorder: An exploratory study,"Wootton, Bethany M.;Melkonian, Maral;McDonald, Sarah;Karin, Eyal;Titov, Nickolai;Dear, Blake F.",British Journal of Clinical Psychology,,2024.6.5,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objectives: Self‐guided internet‐delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD); however, there is little research investigating who dropouts of treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct an exploratory study of predictors of dropout in self‐guided ICBT for OCD. Given that definitions of dropout vary across ICBT studies, we conceptualized dropout in multiple ways: (1) early dropout (proportion of participants who did not complete the pre‐treatment questionnaires); (2) proportion of participants who did not commence the intervention; (3) proportion of participants who did not complete the treatment; and (4) proportion of participants who did not complete the post‐treatment questionnaires. Method: This was a secondary data analysis of 323 participants with OCD symptoms who provided a successful screening assessment to commence an ICBT intervention. Binary logistic regression was used to predict dropout based on a number of exploratory variables. Results: Early dropout was predicted by the country of the participant (participants in the United Kingdom and India being more likely to dropout), as well as shorter symptom duration (explaining 7% of the variance). Medication use predicted non‐completion of the intervention with those taking medication for OCD being less likely to complete the treatment (explaining 3% of the variance). Completion of the post‐treatment questionnaires was predicted by higher contamination symptoms, lower depressive symptoms and higher pre‐treatment conscientiousness (explaining 13% of the variance). There were no significant predictors of treatment commencement. Conclusions: The study provides important preliminary information concerning which patients with OCD may be more likely to drop out of a self‐guided ICBT intervention.

Gold standard treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) that incorporate exposure to traumatic memories to facilitate extinction. CBT can be effective in PTSD, but effects are incomplete and symptoms are prone to spontaneous return. Pharmacologically facilitating fear extinction could potentiate the effects of exposure-based therapy. Here, we explored whether targeting the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, a neuromodulatory system critically involved in fear extinction, would promote the efficacy of exposure-based CBT. Specifically, we tested the effects of elevating the eCB ligand anandamide (AEA) via inhibition of its main degradative enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with PTSD (N = 100; 85 women) were randomized to the FAAH inhibitor (FAAHi) JNJ-42165279 (25 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 12 weeks. In weeks 5–12, all participants completed an internet-delivered CBT that included exposure-based modules. The primary outcome was clinician-assessed PTSD symptom severity (CAPS-5). Secondary outcomes included self-reported symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Blood samples were taken to measure levels of drug and eCBs. Overall, PTSD symptoms improved over time. While FAAHi increased AEA levels, there was no effect of FAAHi on PTSD symptoms or any secondary measure. FAAHi combined with internet-delivered CBT did not improve PTSD symptoms to a greater extent than internet-delivered CBT alone. Thus, FAAH inhibition does not appear to be a suitable adjunct treatment for enhancing CBT in PTSD. This study was registered as Eudra-CT 2020-001965-36.

10.1007/s12671-025-02548-1,"The effects of non-mindfulness practices and human support on depression, mental well-being, and mindfulness in digital mindfulness-based interventions: A four-armed randomized dismantling trial","Zheng, Yuan;Dou, Zenan;Guo, Tingting;Wang, Yunheng;Zeng, Xianglong",Mindfulness,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"ObjectivesThis study examined whether adding non-mindfulness practices (based on positive psychology and cognitive–behavioral therapy) and human support to mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) improved their effectiveness in treating depression and enhancing mental well-being and mindfulness.MethodParticipants experiencing emotional distress (n = 375) were randomly assigned to waitlist control, mindfulness alone (MA), multicomponent MBI without human support (MM; incorporating non-mindfulness practices in addition to MA), and multicomponent MBI with human support (MM-H) groups. Self-help interventions were delivered online over 25 days, with assessments conducted at preintervention, postintervention, and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups.ResultsCompared with the waitlist control, all interventions improved depression and nonreacting (i.e., nonreactivity to inner experience), with small to medium effect sizes. However, intervention effects on mental well-being, observing, describing, acting with awareness, and nonjudging were non-significant. Depression reductions were sustained in the MM and MM-H groups but not in the MA group at the 3-month follow-up. No significant differences emerged between intervention groups on any outcome. Nonreacting mediated the effects of all three interventions on depression. Observing mediated improvements in mental well-being for the MM and MM-H groups but not for the MA group.ConclusionsBrief digital MBIs can effectively reduce depression, with nonreacting as a key mediator. The mediating role of observing in well-being may depend on intervention components. Combining mindfulness, non-mindfulness practices, and human support may enhance long-term effects on depression. Targeting nonreacting and observing in MBIs may facilitate improvements in depression and well-being, respectively.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

10.1017/S1754470X2400028X,Video call-based cognitive behaviour therapy for adults with common mental health conditions: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ebrahimjee, Anisah;Hodsoll, John;Valmaggia, Lucia;Hickling, Lauren M.;Riches, Simon",the Cognitive Behaviour Therapist,,2023.10.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"Implementation of video call-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling more flexible delivery, but less is known about user experience and effectiveness. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of individual video call-based CBT for adults with mild to moderate mental health conditions (Prospero CRD42021291055). Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched until 4 September 2023. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP) assessed methodological quality of studies. Meta-analysis was conducted in R. Thirty studies ( n = 3275), published 2000 to 2022, mainly in the USA ( n = 22/30, 73%), were included. There were 15 randomised control trials, one controlled clinical trial, and 14 uncontrolled studies. Findings indicated feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness (effect size range 0.02–8.30), especially in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for military populations. Other studies investigated depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic with agoraphobia, insomnia, and anxiety. Studies indicated that initial challenges with video call-based CBT subsided as therapy progressed and technical difficulties were managed with limited impact on care. EPHPP ratings were strong ( n = 12/30, 40%), moderate ( n = 12/30, 40%), and weak ( n = 6/30, 20%). Meta-analysis on 12 studies indicated that the difference in effectiveness of video call-based CBT and in-person CBT in reducing symptoms was not significant (SMD = 0.044; CI = –0.086; 0.174). Video calls could increase access to CBT without diminishing effectiveness. Limitations include high prevalence of PTSD studies, lack of standardised definitions, and limited studies, especially those since the COVID-19 pandemic escalated use of video calls. Key learning aims: (1) This review assesses feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of individual video call-based CBT for adults with mild to moderate common mental health conditions, as defined by the ICD-11. (2) Secondary aims were to assess if the therapeutic relationship is affected and identify any potential training needs in delivering video call-based CBT. (3) The adjunct meta-analysis quantitatively explored whether video call-based CBT is as effective as in-person interventions in symptom reduction on primary outcome measures by pooling estimates for studies that compare these treatment conditions.

10.32872/cpe.12899,The effects of mindfulness-focused internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy on elevated levels of stress and symptoms of exhaustion disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Vernmark, Kristofer;Hursti, Timo;Blom, Victoria;Asplund, Robert Persson;Nathanson, Elise;Engelro, Linda;Radvogin, Ella;Andersson, Gerhard",Clinical Psychology in Europe,,2023.9.29,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Internet-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) and mindfulness interventions are commonly used to treat elevated levels of stress. There are however few high-quality studies that examine ICBT with integrated mindfulness components for symptoms of stress and exhaustion, and the role of mindfulness exercises in digital treatment. Method: The aim of the present study was to evaluate if a mindfulness-focused ICBT-program could reduce symptoms of stress and exhaustion, and increase quality of life, in a randomized controlled trial including 97 self-referred participants between 18 and 65 years who experienced elevated levels of stress. Results: The intervention group had significantly reduced symptoms of stress and exhaustion, and increased quality of life, compared to the control group. Compared with the controls, participants in the intervention group showed a significant improvement with moderate to large effects on the primary outcome measure perceived stress ( d = 0.79), and the secondary outcomes, exhaustion ( d = 0.65), and quality of life ( d = 0.40). Participants in the ICBT group also increased their level of mindfulness ( d = 0.66) during the program. The amount of mindfulness training was significantly associated with an increased level of mindfulness, which in turn was significantly associated with reduced stress symptoms. Conclusions: Mindfulness-focused ICBT can be an effective method to reduce stress-related mental health problems and the amount of mindfulness training seems to be of importance to increase the level of experienced mindfulness after treatment.

The effects of these treatments may vary with the degree to which patients are able to implement these practices. In offspring of parents with bipolar and major depressive disorders, we examined whether youth who frequently practiced communication and problem‐solving skills between family‐focused therapy (FFT) sessions had less severe mood symptoms and better psychosocial functioning over 6 months than youth who practiced less frequently. Methods We randomly assigned offspring (ages 12–19) of parents with mood disorders to 12 sessions of FFT plus a mobile app that encouraged the practice of communication, problem‐solving and mood management skills (FFT‐MyCoachConnect [MCC] condition) or 12 sessions of FFT with an app that only allowed for tracking of symptoms and stress (FFT‐Track condition). Independent evaluators assessed youths' mood and psychosocial functioning at 9‐week intervals over 27 weeks. Clinicians rated participants' between‐session skill practice at each FFT session. Results FFT‐MCC was associated with more frequent skill practice than FFT‐Track over 18 weeks of treatment. Skill practice was associated with reductions in youths' mood instability and perceptions of family conflict over 27 weeks in both app conditions. Skill practice mediated the effects of app condition on youths' mood instability and family functioning. Conclusions Mobile applications as adjuncts to family therapy for youth with mood disorders can help increase skill practice. These findings provide preliminary causal evidence for behavioral skill practice improving mood symptoms and family functioning among youth with mood disorders.

Breathing therapy, particularly slow-paced exercises, is gaining recognition for enhancing mental well-being. Integrating these exercises with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appears effective for stress and anxiety management. Technological solutions for home therapy have emerged, improving patient engagement. This study assesses a tactile breath pacer as a CBT adjunct for various mental health conditions. Six participants with conditions including autism, depression, burnout, bipolar disorder, insomnia, and anorexia engaged in therapy using the moonbird breath pacer for a month, with regular email check-ins. The breath pacer's integration into CBT showed positive outcomes. Participants found it user-friendly, adapting it into their daily routines. Customized usage patterns promoted relaxation, emotion regulation, and improved sleep, with many extending use for sleep enhancement. This study demonstrates the benefits of technology in therapy, specifically for emotion regulation, relaxation and sleep. It supports blended care, combining in-person and remote therapy elements, with personalization encouraging active client engagement. Incorporating a breath pacer into CBT shows promise for mental well-being. Technology-enhanced exercises complement traditional therapy, offering personalized treatment and client empowerment. The study emphasizes the potential of technology-assisted mental health care in advancing personalized therapeutic methods.

10.1111/bjc.12444,A randomized clinical trial of a gamified app for the treatment of perfectionism,"Abramovitch, Amitai;Uwadiale, Akuekegbe;Robinson, Anthony",British Journal of Clinical Psychology,,2023.5.15,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objectives Perfectionism is a common transdiagnostic problem that may lead to substantial distress and functional impairments. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for perfectionism. However, the existing significant barriers to access and utilization of mental health services, including among college students, demand the development of low‐intensity accessible interventions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low‐intensity CBT‐based self‐help gamified app developed specifically for perfectionism in a sample of college students. Methods Participants completed assessments of perfectionism, related symptoms, emotional burden and functional impairments at pretreatment, posttreatment and at one‐month follow‐up. Results Compared with the waitlist condition (n = 35), the app condition (n = 35) demonstrated a significant and greater reduction in perfectionism, obsessive‐compulsive symptoms, functional impairments and subjective ratings of emotional burden. Conclusions Results suggest that a brief, daily app‐based game‐like intervention targeting maladaptive perfectionistic beliefs may be a viable, low‐cost alternative to traditional CBT treatments for vulnerable populations on college campuses.

Scalable interventions are needed. This study compared transdiagnostic self-guided and guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (i-CBT) with treatment as usual (TAU) for clinically significant anxiety and depression among undergraduates in Colombia and Mexico. Method: 1,319 anxious, as determined by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 (GAD-7) = 10+ and/or depressed, as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) = 10+, undergraduates (mean [SD] age = 21.4 [3.2]); 78.7% female; 55.9% first-generation university student) from seven universities in Colombia and Mexico were randomized to culturally adapted versions of self-guided i-CBT (n = 439), guided i-CBT (n = 445), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 435). All randomized participants were reassessed 3 months after randomization. The primary outcome was remission of both anxiety (GAD-7 = 0–4) and depression (PHQ-9 = 0–4). We hypothesized that remission would be higher with guided i-CBT than with the other interventions. Results: Intent-to-treat analysis found significantly higher adjusted (for university and loss to follow-up) remission rates (ARD) among participants randomized to guided i-CBT than either self-guided i-CBT (ARD = 13.1%, χ12 = 10.4, p = .001) or TAU (ARD = 11.2%, χ12 = 8.4, p = .004), but no significant difference between self-guided i-CBT and TAU (ARD = −1.9%, χ12 = 0.2, p = .63). Per-protocol sensitivity analyses and analyses of dimensional outcomes yielded similar results. Conclusions: Significant reductions in anxiety and depression among LMIC university students could be achieved with guided i-CBT, although further research is needed to determine which students would most likely benefit from this intervention.

10.2196/42377,Examining predictors of depression and anxiety symptom change in cognitive behavioral immersion: Observational study,"Ezawa, Iony D.;Hollon, Steven D.;Robinson, Noah",JMIR Mental Health,,2022.9.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depressive and anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders, and there is a critical need for effective, affordable, and accessible interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Immersion (CBI) is a novel group-based cognitive behavioral skills training program delivered by lay coaches in the metaverse that can be accessed through various modalities including virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays or flat-screen devices. Combining its ability to offer empirically supported therapy skills in a digital setting that can still facilitate interpersonal variables (eg, working alliance and sense of social support) with the aid of lay coaches, CBI has the potential to help fill this critical need. Objective: This study had 2 primary aims. First, we aimed to examine changes in depression and anxiety symptoms in a sample of individuals who participated in CBI. Second, we aimed to examine 2 interpersonal process variables (working alliance and web-based social support) as predictors of symptom changes. We predicted CBI participants would experience depression and anxiety symptom improvements and that such improvements would be associated with an increase in both interpersonal process variables. Methods: The study sample consists of 127 participants who endorsed clinical levels of depression or anxiety symptoms during their first CBI session and attended at least 2 sessions. Participants were asked to complete self-report measures of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, alliance, and web-based social support throughout their participation in CBI. Results: Repeated measures ANOVAs determined that depression and anxiety symptom scores differed significantly across sessions ( P s&lt;.01). We also found participants’ web-based social support predicted improvement in depression symptoms ( P =.01), but neither the alliance nor web-based social support predicted change in anxiety symptoms ( P s&gt;.05). We also observed a significant difference in anxiety symptoms between participants who used a VR head-mounted display to access CBI and those who did not, such that participants who used VR head-mounted displays endorsed lower anxiety symptoms than those who did not at nearly every session ( P =.04). Conclusions: Participation in CBI is associated with both depression and anxiety symptom improvement. Web-based social support may play an important role in fostering changes in depression symptoms. Future studies are encouraged to continue examining the process of change in CBI with special attention paid to methods that can elucidate causal mechanisms of change (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Access to evidence‐based psychological therapy remains a major challenge. Despite the proven effectiveness of internet‐delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) in reducing depression and anxiety, the research with cancer survivors is still limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an iCBT intervention on depression and anxiety, quality of life, fear of recurrence, active and avoidant coping, and perceived social support in breast cancer survivors. Methods: Seventy‐two participants were randomised to a 7‐module guided iCBT intervention or treatment‐as‐usual (TAU). Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score (HADS‐T). The secondary measures included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC‐QLQ), Breast Cancer Worry Scale (CWC), Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Encountered (Brief COPE), Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS‐SSS). All were completed at baseline, post‐intervention, and 2‐month follow‐up. Groups were compared using linear mixed models. Results: Although non‐significant, iCBT group had lower HADS‐T scores than TAU at post‐intervention. This difference was statistically significant at 2‐month follow‐up ( Hedge's g = −0.094). No significant group‐by‐time interaction effects were found for quality of life, fear of recurrence, active coping, avoidant coping, and perceived social support. The intervention adherence was acceptable; 52.8% ( n = 28) completed all seven modules. Conclusions: iCBT intervention demonstrated its preliminary effectiveness in reducing distress in breast cancer survivors.

However, only a few studies have explored the possible associations between these behaviors and morningness-eveningness. The authors examined whether eveningness predicts these distinct problematic online behaviors differently and directly or via mediators. The associations between eveningness and three different problematic online behaviors (problematic Internet use, problematic online gaming, and problematic social media use) were explored among a large sample of Hungarian young adults (N = 1729, 57.2% female, Mage = 22.01, SDage = 1.97) by using a self-report survey. Depression and the time spent engaging in online activities were assessed as possible mediators. The effects of age and sex were controlled for. Using structural equation modeling, the results supported the association between eveningness and the higher risk for all three problematic online behaviors and highlighted that these associations were mediated by depressive mood and time spent on the activities. In addition, eveningness also predicted PIU directly. Eveningness is a risk factor for problematic online behaviors not only because of the higher amount of time spent on the activities but also because of the worse mood associated with eveningness. The results highlight that it is important to examine the different types of online activity separately and explore the role of diverse risk factors, among them morningness-eveningness.

There is a need for strategies that improve implementation in routine practice. One-size-fits-all strategies are likely to be ineffective. Tailored implementation is considered as a promising approach. The self-guided integrated theory-based Framework for intervention tailoring strategies toolkit (ItFits-toolkit) supports local implementers in developing tailored implementation strategies. Tailoring involves identifying local barriers; matching selected barriers to implementation strategies; developing an actionable work plan; and applying, monitoring, and adapting where necessary. Objective: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the ItFits-toolkit with implementation-as-usual (IAU) in implementing iCBT services in 12 routine mental health care organizations in 9 countries in Europe and Australia. Methods: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design with repeated measures was applied. The trial period lasted 30 months. The primary outcome was the normalization of iCBT delivery by service providers (therapists, referrers, IT developers, and administrators), which was measured with the Normalization Measure Development as a proxy for implementation success. A 3-level linear mixed-effects modeling was applied to estimate the effects. iCBT service uptake (referral and treatment completion rates) and implementation effort (hours) were used as secondary outcomes. The perceived satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire), usability (System Usability Scale), and impact of the ItFits-toolkit by implementers were used to assess the acceptability of the ItFits-toolkit. Results: In total, 456 mental health service providers were included in this study. Compared with IAU, the ItFits-toolkit had a small positive statistically significant effect on normalization levels in service providers (mean 0.09, SD 0.04; P=.02; Cohen d=0.12). The uptake of iCBT by patients was similar to that of IAU. Implementers did not spend more time on implementation work when using the ItFits-toolkit and generally regarded the ItFits-toolkit as usable and were satisfied with it. Conclusions: The ItFits-toolkit performed better than the usual implementation activities in implementing iCBT services in routine practice. There is practical utility in the ItFits-toolkit for supporting implementers in developing and applying effective tailored implementation strategies. However, the effect on normalization levels among mental health service providers was small. These findings warrant modesty regarding the effectiveness of self-guided tailored implementation of iCBT services in routine practice.

Previous research has explored the impact of specific types of activities on participant's main depressive symptoms i.e., anhedonia, or enjoyment levels, and mood (Bunge et al., 2017).The aim of the current study is to improve the understanding of the effects of online micro interventions targeting motivation, enjoyment levels, and mood. Methods: A total of 838 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk participated in an online calendar activity to improve mood. Results: A regression analysis showed that confidence and motivation were significantly associated with mood ( R ² = 0.467, p &lt; .001). The total number of activities reported in the last two days was associated with participants' current mood ( R ² = 0.203, p &lt; .001) and enjoyment ( R ² = 0.156, p &lt; .001). Interestingly, only mastery and meaningful activities improved mood but not pleasant activities. Regarding enjoyment, pleasant and meaningful activities impacted current enjoyment of the day but not mastery activities. Lastly, only individuals who engaged with the calendar showed a significant increase in motivation and confidence. Limitations: Depression may moderate engagement and was not analyzed in the present study. Additionally, there were no follow-up analyses that looked at the long-term effects of the intervention or changes in actual activity engagement. Conclusions: Online micro interventions have a promising future as an intervention that can impact the mood and motivation for change. Future studies should examine increasing engagement to facilitate confidence and motivation to enact change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1089/tmj.2021.0393,Increasing acceptability and outcome expectancy for Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Molloy, Anthony;Anderson, Page L.",Telemedicine and e-Health,,2021.8.4,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: e-Health interventions for mental health have the potential to reduce burdens on health care systems, but large survey studies find low acceptability for these interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic may make attitudes toward e-health more malleable. The current study examined whether an intervention to improve attitudes toward Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has a greater impact during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. Materials and Methods: Individuals ( N = 662) recruited from a large university and surrounding community who participated in a study about the acceptability of iCBT in 2018 and 2019 were asked to participate in a follow-up survey. In the original study, participants were randomized to receive or not receive a rationale designed to increase acceptability of iCBT, and then they completed measures of acceptability and outcome expectancy for iCBT. Fifty-one participants enrolled in the follow-up study from May to July 2020. They received a treatment rationale for iCBT (or not) in keeping with randomization from the parent study and re-completed measures assessing the acceptability and outcome expectancy for iCBT. Results: Contrary to hypotheses, two-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA's) demonstrated that there was no significant interaction between time point and rationale condition on acceptability or outcome expectancy for iCBT. There was a significant main effect of rationale condition on acceptability, such that participants who received a treatment rationale reported greater acceptability for iCBT. There were no significant main effects of time. Conclusions: A treatment rationale was effective in improving acceptability for iCBT in a general population sample, but not more so during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Setting: Community dwelling. Participants: Thirty participants with a traumatic brain injury or stroke randomized to receive CBT-SF in a parent randomized controlled trial. Design: Participants took part in a parallel-groups, parent randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment, comparing an 8-week CBT-SF program with an attentionally equivalent health education control. They were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 2 months post-treatment, and 4 months post-treatment. The study was completed either face-to-face or via telehealth (videoconferencing). Following this trial, a secondary analysis of variables associated with treatment response to CBT-SF was conducted, including: demographic variables; injury-related variables; neuropsychological characteristics; pretreatment sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, anxiety and pain; and mode of treatment delivery (face-to-face or telehealth). Main Measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Results: Greater treatment response to CBT-SF at 4-month follow-up was associated with higher baseline sleep and fatigue symptoms. Reductions in fatigue on the FSS were also related to injury mechanism, where those with a traumatic brain injury had a more rapid and short-lasting improvement in fatigue, compared with those with stroke, who had a delayed but longer-term reduction in fatigue. Mode of treatment delivery did not significantly impact CBT-SF outcomes. Conclusion: Our findings highlight potential differences between fatigue trajectories in traumatic brain injury and stroke, and also provide preliminary support for the equivalence of face-to-face and telehealth delivery of CBT-SF in individuals with ABI.

10.1186/s12888-022-03939-7,The experience of participating in an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program among patients with cardiovascular disease and depression: A qualitative interview study,"Westas, Mats;Mourad, Ghassan;Andersson, Gerhard;Neher, Margit;Lundgren, Johan;Johansson, Peter",BMC Psychiatry,,2021.12.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depression in conjunction with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with worsening in CVD, higher mortality, and poorer quality of life. Despite the poor outcomes there is a treatment gap of depression in CVD patients. Recently we found that an Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) tailored for CVD patients led to reduced symptoms of depression. However, we still have little knowledge about CVD patients’ experiences of working with iCBT. The aim of this study was therefore to explore CVD patients’ experiences of engaging in a tailored iCBT program. Methods: A qualitative interview study using inductive thematic analysis. Data was obtained from 20 patients with CVD and depressive symptoms who had participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a nine-week iCBT program on depression. Results: Three main themes emerged: (1) Taking control of the disease, (2) Not just a walk in the park, and (3) Feeling a personal engagement with the iCBT program. The first theme included comments that the tailored program gave the patients a feeling of being active in the treatment process and helped them achieve changes in thoughts and behaviors necessary to take control of their CVD. The second theme showed that patients also experienced the program as demanding and emotionally challenging. However, it was viewed as helpful to challenge negative thinking about living with CVD and to change depressive thoughts. In the third theme patients reported that the structure inherent in the program, in the form of organizing their own health and the scheduled feedback from the therapist created a feeling of being seen as an individual. The feeling of being acknowledged as a person also made it easier to continuously work with the changes necessary to improve their health. Conclusions: Engaging in an iCBT program tailored for patients with CVD and depression was by the patients perceived as helpful in the treatment of depression. They experienced positive changes in emotions, thoughts, and behaviors which a result of learning to take control of their CVD, being confirmed and getting support. The patients considered working with the iCBT program as demanding and emotionally challenging, but necessary to achieve changes in emotions, thoughts, and behaviors.

Evidence-based lifestyle guidance is required to improve insomnia symptoms not only in person but also in easy-to-use web-based formats. Objective: This study aims to clarify whether unguided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) or the Three Good Things (TGT) exercise, both administered as self-help internet interventions without email support, could improve insomnia symptoms compared with a waiting list control (WLC) group. Methods: A 4-week program was implemented, and participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups. The primary outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI) score at 4 weeks compared with baseline. Results: Of the 21,394 individuals invited to participate, 312 (1.46%) met the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups. Of these 312 individuals, 270 (86.5%; ICBT 79/270, 29.3%; TGT 88/270, 32.6%; and WLC 103/270, 38.1%) completed a postintervention survey at 4 and 8 weeks. The adjusted mean changes of the primary outcome measure (PSQI) in the ICBT (−1.56, 95% CI −2.52 to −0.59; P &lt; .001) and TGT (−1.15, 95% CI −2.08 to −0.23; P = .002) groups at 4 weeks from baseline showed a significant improvement compared with the WLC group. The adjusted mean changes in the secondary outcome measures of sleep onset latency, total sleep time, Athens Insomnia Scale score, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score at 4 weeks from baseline, as well as in the PSQI at 8 weeks from baseline, showed significant improvement for ICBT. Moreover, total sleep time, Athens Insomnia Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores at 4 weeks from baseline showed a significant improvement in the TGT group compared with the WLC group. Conclusions: A total of 4 weeks of unguided ICBT and TGT exercises improved insomnia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.2196/29008,"Effectiveness, user engagement and experience, and safety of a mobile app (Lumi Nova) delivering exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy strategies to manage anxiety in children via immersive gaming technology: Preliminary evaluation study","Lockwood, Joanna;Williams, Laura;Martin, Jennifer L.;Rathee, Manjul;Hill, Claire",JMIR Mental Health,,2021.3.22,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Childhood anxiety disorders are a prevalent mental health problem that can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy, in which exposure is a key component; however, access to treatment is poor. Mobile-based apps on smartphones or tablets may facilitate the delivery of evidence-based therapy for child anxiety, thereby overcoming the access and engagement barriers of traditional treatment. Apps that deliver therapeutic content via immersive gaming technology could offer an effective, highly engaging, and flexible treatment proposition. Objective: In this paper, we aim to describe a preliminary multi-method evaluation of Lumi Nova, a mobile app intervention targeting mild to moderate anxiety problems in children aged 7-12 years using exposure therapy delivered via an immersive game. The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, user engagement and experience, and safety of the beta version of Lumi Nova. Methods: Lumi Nova was co-designed with children, parents, teachers, clinicians, game industry experts, and academic partnerships. In total, 120 community-based children with mild to moderate anxiety and their guardians were enrolled to participate in an 8-week pilot study. The outcome measures captured the app’s effectiveness (anxiety symptoms, child-identified goal-based outcomes, and functional impairment), user engagement (game play data and ease-of-use ratings), and safety (mood ratings and adverse events). The outcome measures before and after the intervention were available for 30 children (age: mean 9.8, SD 1.7 years; girls: 18/30, 60%; White: 24/30, 80%). Additional game play data were automatically generated for 67 children (age: mean 9.6, SD 1.53 years; girls: 35/67, 52%; White: 42/67, 63%). Postintervention open-response data from 53% (16/30) of guardians relating to the primary objectives were also examined. Results: Playing Lumi Nova was effective in reducing anxiety symptom severity over the 8-week period of game play ( t₂₉ =2.79; P =.009; Cohen d =0.35) and making progress toward treatment goals ( z =2.43; P =.02), but there were no improvements in relation to functional impairment. Children found it easy to play the game and engaged safely with therapeutic content. However, the positive effects were small, and there were limitations to the game play data. Conclusions: This preliminary study provides initial evidence that an immersive mobile game app may safely benefit children experiencing mild to moderate anxiety. It also demonstrates the value of the rigorous evaluation of digital interventions during the development process to rapidly improve readiness for full market launch.

This study uses a data-driven approach to define fluid depressive states and explore how patients transition between these states in response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Methods Item-level Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) data were collected from 9891 patients with a diagnosis of depression, at each CBT treatment session. Latent Markov modelling was used on these data to define depressive states and explore transition probabilities between states. Clinical outcomes and patient demographics were compared between patients starting at different depressive states. Results A model with seven depressive states emerged as the best compromise between optimal fit and interpretability. States loading preferentially on cognitive/affective v . somatic symptoms of depression were identified. Analysis of transition probabilities revealed that patients in cognitive/affective states do not typically transition towards somatic states and vice-versa. Post-hoc analyses also showed that patients who start in a somatic depressive state are less likely to engage with or improve with therapy. These patients are also more likely to be female, suffer from a comorbid long-term physical condition and be taking psychotropic medication. Conclusions This study presents a novel approach for depression sub-typing, defining fluid depressive states and exploring transitions between states in response to CBT. Understanding how different symptom profiles respond to therapy will inform the development and delivery of stratified treatment protocols, improving clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of psychological therapies for patients with depression.

J.;Newby, Jill M.",Journal of Anxiety Disorders,,2021.1.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Accessible, affordable cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) options for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) that allow for rapid symptom improvement are needed. The present study investigated the first intensive, 7-day internet-based CBT for SAD. An open pilot trial was conducted to test the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the program in a sample of 16 participants (9 females, M age = 40.34, SD = 10.55) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of SAD. Participants were enrolled into the 6-lesson online program, and completed the Social Phobia Scale [SPS], Social Interaction Anxiety Scale [SIAS], Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at baseline, post and one month follow-up. We found support for the feasibility and acceptability of the program; 15 participants (93.8%) completed the program, and all participants reported the program was satisfactory. Large, significant reductions in social anxiety severity on both the SPS and SIAS (Hedges’ g s = 1.26–1.9) and functional impairment (WSAS; g s = 0.88–0.98) were found at post-treatment and follow-up. Medium, significant reductions in depressive symptom severity were also found ( g s = 0.88–0.98 at post and follow-up, respectively). A third of participants scored below the clinical cut-off on both the SPS and SIAS at post-treatment and follow-up. A randomized controlled trial with longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this intensive internet-based treatment for SAD. Implications and future research directions are discussed.

Method: Participants with at least a moderate level of depressive symptoms (n = 79), as indicated by a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of ≥10, were randomly assigned to an LM intervention group (LMG; n = 39; eight weekly sessions) or a waitlist control group (WLG; n = 40). Results: The intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (d = 0.66), generalized anxiety symptoms (d = 0.93), insomnia symptoms (d = 0.20), functional impairment (d = 0.22), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL; d = 0.11) from Week 0 (baseline) to Week 9 (immediate post-intervention assessment) in the LMG relative to the WLG. Moreover, significantly more health-promoting behaviors (overall health behaviors, health responsibility, physical activity level, nutrition, spiritual growth, and stress management) (d = 0.40–0.89) and higher levels of total activity (d = 0.55) and walking activity (d = 0.55) were found at Week 9 in the LMG relative to the WLG. However, no significant differences were observed in interpersonal relationships, vigorous and moderate exercise levels, sedentary behavior levels, or food frequency questionnaire measures at Week 9 between the LMG and the WLG. From Week 9 to Week 13 (1-month follow-up assessment), a significant within-group reduction in HRQoL (d = 0.50) and an increase in alcohol intake (d = 0.41) were observed in the LMG.

10.1016/j.chb.2021.106807,Cognitive functioning mediates the relationship between self-perceptions of aging and computer use behavior in late adulthood: Evidence from two longitudinal studies,"Mariano, João;Marques, Sibila;Ramos, Miguel R.;de Vries, Hein",Computers in Human Behavior,,2020.10.16,Scholarly Journals,English,"Although information and communication technologies have become an integral part of contemporary societies, substantial proportions of the older population remain distant from these digital tools. This stresses the importance of identifying age-specific factors that facilitate or prevent technology adoption among older age groups. Despite being powerful determinants of behavior and health in late adulthood, little is known about the role of stereotypical perceptions about age and aging in the behavioral engagement with technological devices. Across two longitudinal studies, we examined the relationship between self-perceptions of aging and computer use behavior, as well as the mediating role of cognitive functioning. Study 1 was based on the 2010, 2014, and 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study ( n = 3404). Study 2 was based on the 2014 and 2017 waves of the German Ageing Survey ( n = 4871). Both studies revealed that more positive self-perceptions of aging were associated with more frequent computer use behavior. Moreover, this relationship was partially mediated by cognitive functioning. This suggests that perceptions about their aging experience can influence how individuals behave towards computer technology by impacting important predictors of use behavior. Interventions promoting positive self-perceptions of aging may thus contribute to the digital inclusion of middle-aged and older adults.

10.2196/21177,Developing messaging content for a physical activity smartphone app tailored to low-income patients: User-centered design and crowdsourcing approach,"Pathak, Laura Elizabeth;Aguilera, Adrian;Williams, Joseph Jay;Lyles, Courtney Rees;Hernandez-Ramos, Rosa;Miramontes, Jose;Cemballi, Anupama Gunshekar;Figueroa, Caroline Astrid",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2020.6.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Text messaging interventions can be an effective and efficient way to improve health behavioral changes. However, most texting interventions are neither tested nor designed with diverse end users, which could reduce their impact, and there is limited evidence regarding the optimal design methodology of health text messages tailored to low-income, low–health literacy populations and non-English speakers. Objective: This study aims to combine participant feedback, crowdsourced data, and researcher expertise to develop motivational text messages in English and Spanish that will be used in a smartphone app–based texting intervention that seeks to encourage physical activity in low-income minority patients with diabetes diagnoses and depression symptoms. Methods: The design process consisted of 5 phases and was iterative in nature, given that the findings from each step informed the subsequent steps. First, we designed messages to increase physical activity based on the behavior change theory and knowledge from the available evidence. Second, using user-centered design methods, we refined these messages after a card sorting task and semistructured interviews (N = 10) and evaluated their likeability during a usability testing phase of the app prototype (N = 8). Third, the messages were tested by English- and Spanish-speaking participants on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform (N = 134). Participants on MTurk were asked to categorize the messages into overarching theoretical categories based on the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior framework. Finally, each coauthor rated the messages for their overall quality from 1 to 5. All messages were written at a sixth-grade or lower reading level and culturally adapted and translated into neutral Spanish by bilingual research staff. Results: A total of 200 messages were iteratively refined according to the feedback from target users gathered through user-centered design methods, crowdsourced results of a categorization test, and an expert review. User feedback was leveraged to discard unappealing messages and edit the thematic aspects of messages that did not resonate well with the target users. Overall, 54 messages were sorted into the correct theoretical categories at least 50% of the time in the MTurk categorization tasks and were rated 3.5 or higher by the research team members. These were included in the final text message bank, resulting in 18 messages per motivational category. Conclusions: By using an iterative process of expert opinion, feedback from participants that were reflective of our target study population, crowdsourcing, and feedback from the research team, we were able to acquire valuable inputs for the design of motivational text messages developed in English and Spanish with a low literacy level to increase physical activity. We describe the design considerations and lessons learned for the text messaging development process and provide a novel, integrative framework for future developers of health text messaging interventions.

This study identified relevant psychological factors that affect excessive Internet use (EIU) and excessive smartphone use (ESU) in adolescents using structural equation modeling (SEM). A sample of 714 individuals drawn from lists of middle school students in South Korea completed self-administered questionnaires, including Young’s Internet Addiction Test (Y-IAT), the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS), and various clinical and psychological scales measuring depression, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), aggression, expression of anger, and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS)/activation system (BAS). The final model, fitted using SEM, showed that both clinical characteristics, including ADHD symptoms, aggression, expression of anger, depression, and anxiety, and personality characteristics, represented by BIS/BAS, played important roles in the severity of EIU or ESU. In particular, affective components such as depression and anxiety were significantly associated with both EIU and ESU, whereas aggression, the expression of anger, and ADHD symptoms affected only EIU. Furthermore, the association between ESU and EIU was significant. Although personality characteristics measured by the BIS and BAS scores did not have direct effects on addiction, they were associated with clinical features and might be risk factors for addiction. The model revealed significant pathways from personality and clinical features to EIU and ESU in adolescents and informed our basic understanding of the meaningful predictors of these addictions and their direct and indirect influences.

10.2196/18220,Effectiveness of a transdiagnostic guided internet-delivered protocol for emotional disorders versus treatment as usual in specialized care: Randomized controlled trial,"González-Robles, Alberto;Díaz-García, Amanda;García-Palacios, Azucena;Roca, Pablo;Ramos-Quiroga, Josep Antoni;Botella, Cristina",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2020.2.14,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Anxiety disorders and depression (emotional disorders) are highly prevalent mental disorders. Extensive empirical evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of these disorders. However, there are still some barriers related to their dissemination and implementation, which make it difficult for patients to receive these treatments,especially in public health care settings where resources are limited. Recent advances in improving CBT dissemination encompass different perspectives. One is the transdiagnostic approach, which offers treatment protocols that can be used for a range of emotional disorders. Another approach is the use of the internet to reach a larger number of people who could benefit from CBT. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness and acceptability of a transdiagnostic internet-delivered protocol (Emotion Regulation) with human and automated guidance in patients from public specialized mental health care settings. Methods: A 2-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare the effectiveness of Emotion Regulation with treatment as usual (TAU) in specialized mental health care. In all, 214 participants were randomly assigned to receive either Emotion Regulation (n = 106) or TAU (n = 108). Measurement assessments were conducted at pre- and postintervention and at a3-month follow-up. Results: The results revealed the superiority of Emotion Regulation over TAU on measures of depression ( d = 0.41), anxiety( d = 0.35), and health-related quality of life ( d = −0.45) at posttreatment, and these gains were maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, the results for expectations and opinions showed that Emotion Regulation was well accepted by participants. Conclusions: Emotion Regulation was more effective than TAU for the treatment of emotional disorders in the Spanish public mental health system. The implications of this RCT, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

One way to increase precision and clinical utility could be to use machine learning methods, which can incorporate multiple non-linear associations in prediction models. Methods: This study used a random forests machine learning approach to test if it is possible to reliably predict remission from BDD in a sample of 88 individuals that had received internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for BDD. The random forest models were compared to traditional logistic regression analyses. Results: Random forests correctly identified 78% of participants as remitters or non-remitters at post-treatment. The accuracy of prediction was lower in subsequent follow-ups (68, 66 and 61% correctly classified at 3-, 12- and 24-month follow-ups, respectively). Depressive symptoms, treatment credibility, working alliance, and initial severity of BDD were among the most important predictors at the beginning of treatment. By contrast, the logistic regression models did not identify consistent and strong predictors of remission from BDD. Conclusions: The results provide initial support for the clinical utility of machine learning approaches in the prediction of outcomes of patients with BDD.

J.;Mason, Elizabeth;Andrews, Gavin",Journal of Affective Disorders,,2019.6.24,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: Randomised controlled trials have shown that internet-delivered cognitive behavioural treatment (iCBT) is an effective treatment for health anxiety, but the effectiveness of these programs in routine care has not been investigated. This study examined the effectiveness of iCBT for health anxiety symptoms in routine care settings in the community. Methods: Using an open-trial design, we investigated adherence to, and effectiveness of a 6-lesson iCBT program for health anxiety symptoms amongst individuals ( n = 391, mean age 41 years, 64% female) who enrolled in the program either self-guided ( n = 312) or under the supervision of community clinicians (general practitioners, psychologists and other allied health professionals) ( n = 79). Primary outcome was health anxiety severity on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), and secondary outcomes were depression severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) (depression) and distress (Kessler-10: K-10). Results: Adherence to the iCBT program was modest (45.6% in the clinician-supervised group, 33.0% in the unguided group), but within-subjects effect sizes were large (SHAI: g = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.45–1.88; PHQ-9: g = 1.12, 95%CI: 0.92–1.32; K-10: g = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15–1.56). Limitations: No control group, lack of follow-up data. Conclusions: iCBT is an effective treatment for health anxiety symptoms in routine care, but methods to increase adherence are needed to optimise benefits to participants. Randomised controlled effectiveness trials with long-term follow-up are needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

However, few studies used routinely available sociodemographic and clinical data for this task, and many previous investigations used highly selected samples. This study aimed to investigate cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outcomes in a large, naturalistic and longitudinal dataset. Routine data from a university-based outpatient center with n = 2.147 patients was analyzed. Only baseline data including sociodemographics, symptom measures and functional impairment ratings was used for prediction. Different competing classification and regression models were compared to each other; the best models were then applied to previously unseen validation data. Applied on the validation set, the best performing classification model for remission achieved a balanced accuracy of 59% (p &lt; 0.001) and the best performing regression model for dimensional change achieved r = 0.27 (p &lt; 0.001). Age, sex, functional impairment, symptom severity, and axis II comorbidity were among the most important features. Predictor performances significantly exceeded chance level but were far from clinical utility. Neither applying more sophisticated approaches nor restricting the sample to homogeneous subgroups resulted in considerable performance gains. Adding hypotheses-based, more specific clinical constructs and deep (e.g. neurobiological) to digital phenotypes may increase prediction performance.

The present study evaluated the efficacy of a telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (T-CBT) on parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. A multi-site randomized controlled trial was conducted between July 2012 and March 2014. A total of 397 Chinese mothers at risk of postnatal depression were recruited through the postnatal units at three regional public hospitals in Hong Kong and were randomized to receive T- CBT ( n = 197) or standard care ( n = 200). The T-CBT consisted of five weekly 30-min sessions focusing on changing dysfunctional cognitions and developing problem-solving skills. Parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction were measured by the efficacy and satisfaction subscales of the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC-E/S), respectively, at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months postpartum. When compared with standard care, T-CBT was associated with a significant improvement in parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction at 6 weeks postpartum (mean difference in PSOC-E: 2.85 [95% CI: 1.72–3.98], p &lt; .001; mean difference in PSOC-S score: 1.61 [95% CI: 0.52–2.71], p = .004), and 6 months (mean difference in PSOC-E score: 3.37 [95% CI: 1.89–4.85], p &lt; .001; mean difference in PSOC-S score: 2.39 [95% CI: 0.96–3.82], p = .001).

Materials and methods: The patients (N = 143) were recruited from an ongoing effectiveness study in secondary mental health outpatient services in Norway. Weekly self-reported primary panic disorder symptoms and secondary depressive symptoms were analysed. Results: primary panic disorder symptoms and secondary depressive symptoms improved significantly during the course of treatment, and at six months follow-up. Parallel process latent growth curve modelling showed that the trajectory of depressive symptoms and trajectory of panic disorder symptoms were significantly related. A supplementary analysis with cross-lagged panel modelling showed that (1) pre-treatment depressive symptoms predicted a positive effect of panic disorder symptoms early in treatment; (2) high early treatment panic disorder symptoms predicted low depressive symptoms at post-treatment. Conclusions: Guided ICBT for panic disorder is effective for both primary panic disorder symptoms and secondary depressive symptoms. Patients with high pre-treatment secondary depressive symptoms may constitute a vulnerable subgroup. A high level of panic disorder symptoms early in treatment seems beneficiary for depressive symptoms outcome. A time-dependent model may be necessary to describe the relationship between PAD symptoms and depressive symptoms during the course of treatment.

10.1002/ejp.1402,An internet‐delivered cognitive behavioural therapy pain management programme for spinal cord injury pain: A randomized controlled trial,"Burke, Dearbhla;Lennon, Olive;Blake, Catherine;Nolan, Maeve;Barry, Sorcha;Smith, Eimear;Maye, Fiona;Lynch, John;O'Connor, Lorna;Maume, Liz;Cheyne, Sheena;Ní Ghiollain, Sadb;Fullen, Brona M.",European Journal of Pain,,2018.2.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Chronic pain is common after spinal cord injury (SCI) and dedicated SCI cognitive behavioural therapy pain management programmes (CBT‐PMPs) have a growing evidence base to support their uptake clinically. The development of internet‐delivered treatment options may overcome barriers to the access and uptake of centre‐based programmes. This study examines such an approach on quality of lie (QoL), pain, mood and sleep. Methods: Adults with SCI pain (&gt; 3 months) were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention comprised a six module CBT‐PMP delivered once weekly. A blinded assessor determined changes in self‐reported outcome measures post‐intervention and at 3 months. Linear mixed models and effect sizes based on changes between groups were reported. Significance was set p &lt; 0.05. Results: The recruitment rate was 32% (intervention n = 35, control n = 34), and the drop‐out rate at 3 months was 26%. On average, participants accessed three (SD 2.1) of six modules. While no difference in QoL was reported, a significant group*time interaction was found for NRS of current pain (χ² = 8.22, p = 0.016), worst pain (χ² = 11.20, p = 0.004), and Brief Pain Inventory (interference) (χ² = 6.924, p = 0.031). Moderate to large effect sizes favouring the intervention were demonstrated at each time point for the pain metrics (Cohen's d : 0.38–0.84). At 3‐month follow‐up, 48% of the intervention group rated themselves improved or very much improved ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of an internet‐delivered SCI specific CBT‐PMP in reporting significant statistical and clinical benefit in pain intensity and interference. Strategies to improve engagement are needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

10.2196/11349,Reducing Stress and Preventing Depression (RESPOND): Randomized controlled trial of web-based rumination-focused cognitive behavioral therapy for high-ruminating university students,"Cook, Lorna;Mostazir, Mohammod;Watkins, Edward",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2018.6.22,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Prevention of depression is a priority to reduce its global disease burden. Targeting specific risk factors, such as rumination, may improve prevention. Rumination-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (RFCBT) was developed to specifically target depressive rumination. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to test whether guided Web-based RFCBT (i-RFCBT) would prevent the incidence of major depression relative to usual care in UK university students. The secondary objective was to test the feasibility and estimated effect sizes of unguided i-RFCBT. Methods: To address the primary objective, a phase III randomized controlled trial was designed and powered to compare high risk university students (N = 235), selected with elevated worry/rumination, recruited via an open access website in response to circulars within universities and internet advertisements, randomized to receive either guided i-RFCBT (interactive Web-based RFCBT, supported by asynchronous written Web-based support from qualified therapists) or usual care control. To address the secondary objective, participants were also randomized to an adjunct arm of unguided (self-administered) i-RFCBT. The primary outcome was the onset of a major depressive episode over 15 months, assessed with structured diagnostic interviews at 3 (postintervention), 6, and 15 months post randomization, conducted by telephone, blind to the condition. Secondary outcomes of symptoms of depression and anxiety and levels of worry and rumination were self-assessed through questionnaires at baseline and the same follow-up intervals. Results: Participants were randomized to guided i-RFCBT (n = 82), unguided i-RFCBT (n = 76), or usual care (n = 77). Guided i-RFCBT reduced the risk of depression by 34% relative to usual care (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.25; P = .20). Participants with higher levels of baseline stress benefited most from the intervention (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87; P = .02). Significant improvements in rumination, worry, and depressive symptoms were found in the short-to-medium term. Of the 6 modules, guided participants completed a mean of 3.46 modules (SD 2.25), with 46% (38/82) being compliant (completing ≥ 4 modules). Similar effect sizes and compliance rates were found for unguided i-RFCBT. Conclusions: Guided i-RFCBT can reduce the onset of depression in high-risk young people reporting high levels of worry/rumination and stress. The feasibility study argues for formally testing unguided i-RFCBT for prevention: if the observed effect sizes are robustly replicated in a phase III trial, it has potential as a scalable prevention intervention.

Participants were women recruited in Australia by advertisements posted on social media websites, online forums and flyers distributed in maternity hospitals in Sydney, Australia. This study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy and acceptability of MUMentum Postnatal, a brief unguided iCBT intervention for the treatment of anxiety and/or depression in postpartum women. Our findings contribute to the existing evidence base for the efficacy of iCBT for postpartum depression, and establishes preliminary efficacy of iCBT for postpartum GAD, and comorbid MDD and GAD symptoms. This is particularly important for the treatment of postpartum anxiety, which has received little attention to date. Further RCTs are required to replicate our findings and investigate whether treatment effects are sustained long-term. The potential clinical value of unguided iCBT for postpartum women is substantial. MUMentum Postnatal can overcome barriers to accessing treatment and improve treatment coverage as a scalable and low cost ‘first step’ intervention for all women screening positive for distress, anxiety and/or depression in routine care.

10.2196/10124,Clinical feasibility of a just-in-time adaptive intervention app (iREST) as a behavioral sleep treatment in a military population: Feasibility comparative effectiveness study,"Pulantara, I. Wayan;Parmanto, Bambang;Germain, Anne",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2018.2.15,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Although evidence-based cognitive behavioral sleep treatments have been shown to be safe and effective, these treatments have limited scalability. Mobile health tools can address this scalability challenge. iREST, or interactive Resilience Enhancing Sleep Tactics, is a mobile health platform designed to provide a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) in the assessment, monitoring, and delivery of evidence-based sleep recommendations in a scalable and personalized manner. The platform includes a mobile phone–based patient app linked to a clinician portal. Objective: The first aim of the pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of JITAI using the iREST platform for delivering evidence-based sleep interventions in a sample of military service members and veterans. The second aim was to explore the potential effectiveness of this treatment delivery form relative to habitual in-person delivery. Methods: In this pilot study, military service members and veterans between the ages of 18 and 60 years who reported clinically significant service-related sleep disturbances were enrolled as participants. Participants were asked to use iREST for a period of 4 to 6 weeks during which time they completed a daily sleep/wake diary. Through the clinician portal, trained clinicians offered recommendations consistent with evidence-based behavioral sleep treatments on weeks 2 through 4. To explore potential effectiveness, self-report measures were used, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the PSQI Addendum for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Results: A total of 27 participants completed the posttreatment assessments. Between pre- and postintervention, clinically and statistically significant improvements in primary and secondary outcomes were detected (eg, a mean reduction on the ISI of 9.96, t ₂₆ = 9.99, P &lt; .001). At posttreatment, 70% (19/27) of participants met the criteria for treatment response and 59% (16/27) achieved remission. Comparing these response and remission rates with previously published results for in-person trials showed no significant differences. Conclusion: Participants who received evidence-based recommendations from their assigned clinicians through the iREST platform showed clinically significant improvements in insomnia severity, overall sleep quality, and disruptive nocturnal disturbances. These findings are promising, and a larger noninferiority clinical trial is warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Online cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is increasingly used, but the factors modulating response to this treatment modality remain unclear. Aims: This study aims to explore the demographic and clinical predictors of response to one-to-one CBT delivered via the internet. Method: Real-world clinical outcomes data were collected from 2211 NHS England patients completing a course of CBT delivered by a trained clinician via the internet. Logistic regression analyses were performed using patient and service variables to identify significant predictors of response to treatment. Results: Multiple patient variables were significantly associated with positive response to treatment including older age, absence of long-term physical comorbidities and lower symptom severity at start of treatment. Service variables associated with positive response to treatment included shorter waiting times for initial assessment and longer treatment durations in terms of the number of sessions. Conclusions: Knowledge of which patient and service variables are associated with good clinical outcomes can be used to develop personalised treatment programmes, as part of a quality improvement cycle aiming to drive up standards in mental healthcare. This study exemplifies translational research put into practice and deployed at scale in the National Health Service, demonstrating the value of technology-enabled treatment delivery not only in facilitating access to care, but in enabling accelerated data capture for clinical research purposes.

M.",L'Encéphale: Revue de psychiatrie clinique biologique et thérapeutique,,2016.9.8,Scholarly Journals,English,"Comments on an article by S. Hartley et al. (see record 2016-56131-003). This article provides an eloquent demonstration of how a large number of patients with chronic insomnia had relatively easy access to and were treated effectively with a “low intensity” therapy. Using a self-referral model with minimal selection criteria, nearly 500 patients were treated with CBT-I in the context of three, 90-min, group therapy sessions. There is a major gap between the extensive research evidence supporting the acceptability, efficacy, and durability of CBT-I and current clinical practices in the management of insomnia. The issue is no longer whether CBT-I is effective, as many randomized controlled trials and consensus reports fully endorse its use as first-line therapy but rather how can we export more efficiently this therapy directly to those who are likely to benefit from it (i.e. patients) and increase its utilization in day to day clinical practice among health care providers. Aside from the traditional face-to-face, one-to-one, consultation model, there are far more cost-effective treatment delivery models that could facilitate access to and delivery of CBT-I. These include group therapy, telephone consultation, telehealth, internet-based therapy, and mobile applications, just to name a few. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)"

Videoconferencing has been used effectively to treat different mental disorders but its use for IED patients is as yet unknown. The aim of this study is to provide preliminary evidence of the possibility of treating IED by videoconference. We present a case-study experiment of a Spanish male, aged 33 years, living and working in China. After the intervention, the patient’s aggressive episodes decreased dramatically, as well as his negative affect. In contrast, he showed an important increment in positive emotions and self-esteem. There were also positive changes in some personality dimensions and facets measured by NEO-PI-R, specifically in neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness. The benefits were maintained at 3-, 8- and 18-month follow-ups. These preliminary results reveal that CBT by videoconference oriented to increasing emotion regulation skills was effective when implemented in a case study of a person suffering from IED.

Problematic gaming behavior was measured with the Game Addiction Scale (GAS). Self-reports covered health measures such as psychological health (psychopathological symptoms, satisfaction with life), social health (preferences for social interaction), and physical health (general health, Body Mass Index [BMI], body discomfort, physical activity). Results: Problematic gaming behavior was found to relate to psychological and health problems, namely fatigue, sleep interference, depression and anxiety symptoms. Multiple linear regression indicated that the amount of weekly gaming, depression and a preference for online social interaction predicted increased problematic gaming symptoms.

Overall, 34% entered treatment within 7 days (intervention: 40% versus control: 26%, p = 0.03). In a multivariate ""intention to treat"" model (i.e., ignoring the amount of case management actually received), those randomized to case management were more likely to enter treatment within 7 days. Additional 'as treated' analyses revealed that participants who received 30 min or more of case management within 7 days were 33% more likely to enter treatment and the active ingredient of case management activities was provision of transportation. These findings demonstrate the combined value of offering dedicated treatment referrals from NEP, case management and transportation in facilitating entry into drug abuse treatment. Such initiatives could be implemented at more than 140 needle exchange programs currently operating in the United States.

Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) may address some barriers to care. This study is the first to examine the prospective noninferiority of a smartphone-based, self-guided relational agent (W-GenZD) DMHI to address adolescent depressive symptoms compared to group-based telehealth cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT). METHOD: Adolescents 13 to 17 years of age who were seeking treatment for depression and/or anxiety at a children’s hospital outpatient mental health program and who met study inclusion criteria were randomized to either W-GenZD (n = 71) or CBT Group (n = 70). The primary aim was to examine feasibility and acceptability. The secondary aim was to test the noninferiority of W-GenZD compared to CBT Group on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) at 4 weeks (end of treatment [EOT]). The study also examined the trajectory of working alliance, anxiety, general mood, and safety in each intervention group. RESULTS: W-GenZD was noninferior to CBT Group in reducing depressive symptoms, with a mean between-group PHQ-8 EOT score difference of −0.67, 95% CI = − 2.30, 0.82 in intent-to-treat analysis (N = 141) using multiple imputation for missing values. Four different sensitivity analyses confirmed noninferiority, including per protocol analysis (−1.38, −3.61, 0.86, n = 82). Feasibility, acceptability, and tertiary aims were similar in both groups, and data support the safety of W-GenZD in a mental health outpatient setting. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that W-GenZD is a feasible and efficacious intervention for adolescents presenting with depression and/or anxiety in a real-world setting. W-GenZD could help expand the capacity of mental health clinicians to support the many youth and families in need of mental health care.

The goal of the current study was to test whether therapist-supported internet-based RNT-targeting cognitive behavioral therapy reduces RNT, anxiety, and depression in adults with elevated RNT and anxiety and/or depression. To this end, a single-blind, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 118 adults across Romania with elevated levels of worry and/or rumination and at least a subclinical/clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), or panic disorder. Eligible participants were randomized to internet rumination-focused CBT (i-RF-CBT; n = 59) or a waitlist control group (i-RF-CBT delayed 7 weeks; n = 59). Primary outcome was changes in perseverative thinking, anxiety, and depression 7 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes included changes on all measures after 6 months in the i-RF-CBT condition only.

This error has been updated in the original publication] Increasing evidence has shown that childhood anxiety can be effectively treated by Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). Being able to predict why participants decide to drop out of such programs enables scarce resources to be used appropriately. The aim of this study was to report dropout predictors for a population-based ICBT intervention aimed at children with anxiety, together with the time they and their parents spent on the program and client satisfaction rates. The study focused on 234 Finnish children aged 10–13 who received an ICBT intervention, with telephone support, for anxiety symptoms, as a part of a randomized control trial. Their parents also had access to Internet-based material and participated in the weekly telephone calls with the coach. Possible drop out factors were explored and these included various family demographics, child and parent psychopathology and therapeutic alliance. Just under a fourth (23.9%) of the children dropped out of the intervention. The risk was higher if the child did not fulfill the criteria for any anxiety diagnosis or reported a poorer therapeutic alliance. Family demographics and the COVID-19 pandemic did not increase the risk. The families spent an average of 127 min on the webpage each week and an average of 32 min on the phone calls. The overall satisfaction with the program was 87% for the children and 95% for the parents. Both the children and the parents found the telephone calls helpful. These findings are important in clinical practice when assessing a family’s eligibility for ICBT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1111/bjc.12524,Reasons for seeking internet‐delivered treatment for individuals with obsessive‐compulsive disorder,"Melkonian, Maral;McDonald, Sarah;Karin, Eyal;Titov, Nickolai;Dear, Blake F.;Wootton, Bethany M.",British Journal of Clinical Psychology,,2024.7.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objectives Patients with obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD) face multiple barriers when accessing treatment and rarely receive best‐practice cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) when they seek help. Remote treatments, such as internet‐delivered CBT (ICBT), enhance access to evidence‐based treatments. To date, no known studies have examined the reasons individuals seek remote treatment over traditional in‐person treatment for OCD. Thus, the aim of the current study was to examine the treatment histories of individuals who completed ICBT for OCD and their reasons for seeking ICBT. Methods One hundred and sixty‐six participants (Mage = 33.88; SD = 13.41, 71.7% female) were included in the study. Results Almost three‐quarters of the sample had previously spoken to a health professional about their OCD symptoms. General practitioners were the most frequently consulted health professionals initially (41.7%), while psychologists were the most frequently consulted overall (81.7%). Supportive counselling (74.2%) and medication (72.5%) were the most common forms of treatment ever received. Of those who had received CBT for OCD, only 20.0% (12.5% of the overall sample) likely received best‐practice CBT. The most frequently endorsed reasons for seeking ICBT over in‐person treatment related to having no access to face‐to‐face treatment in the community (25.9%) and having found previous face‐to‐face treatment unhelpful (24.1%). Group differences in reasons for seeking ICBT over face‐to‐face treatment emerged based on geographical location, OCD severity and presence of comorbid depressive symptoms. Conclusions Evidence‐based treatment for OCD is underutilized in the community highlighting the need to develop and disseminate evidence‐based remote treatments for OCD.

We analyzed the 2nd wave data of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018 for middle school students. Structural equation modeling results showed that smartphone dependency partially mediated the relationship between aggression and cyberbullying perpetration (β = 0.050, p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, smartphone dependency fully mediated the relationship between depression and cyberbullying perpetration (β = 0.029, p &lt; 0.01). Aggression, depression, and smartphone dependency are the main predictors of cyberbullying perpetration. The effects of aggression and depression on cyberbullying perpetration were different through the mediator variable of smartphone dependency. The positive effect of aggression on smartphone dependency was twice greater in girls (Boys, B = 0.222, p &lt; 0.001; Girls, B = 0.497, p &lt; 0.001), and that of depression on smartphone dependency was three times greater in boys (Boys, B = 0.308, p &lt; 0.001; Girls, B = 0.097, p &lt; 0.05). These results were interpreted as reflecting the boys’ emotional suppression. Adolescent boys tend to suppress depression more than to express it according to the process of masculine emotional socialization. Various educational interventions are needed, such as providing cognitive behavioral therapy to convert adolescents’ relational aggression into a sound coping method considering girls’ sensitivity to relationships. Based on the findings, we present field-oriented practical considerations for improving our understanding of cyberbullying and preventing cyberbullying perpetration.

In the original article, there were some errors. The corrections are given in this erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2022-76104-006). Aims: To synthesize the effectiveness of web‐based psychosocial interventions on self‐efficacy, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), non‐specific psychological and cancer‐specific distress among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Design: A systematic review and meta‐analysis. Data sources: Six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and CNKI) were searched from inception to December 2021. Review methods: Experimental/quasi‐experimental studies involving patients with CRC for the improvement of aforementioned outcomes were included. Two reviewers screened and extracted the data, and assessed studies' methodological quality using risk of bias tools. Meta‐analyses and narrative syntheses were performed. Results: Nineteen studies consisting of 1386 participants were identified. Cognitive‐behavioural therapy delivered online was the most common trialled web‐based psychosocial intervention. Meta‐analyses revealed no positive effect for self‐efficacy (standardized mean difference 0.93, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.35, p &lt; .01) and minimal benefit for QoL (mean difference [MD] 2.83, 95% CI: −0.31 to 5.98, p = .08) but significant positive effects for anxiety (MD −2.23, 95% CI: −3.31 to −1.14, p &lt; .01) and depression (MD −2.84, 95% CI: −4.09 to −1.59, p &lt; .01) among CRC survivors in the intervention group as compared with the control group. Narrative synthesis suggested possible benefits in reducing distress. Conclusion: Web‐based psychosocial interventions are promising alternatives to conventional delivery methods in reducing patients' anxiety, depression and distress. However, evidence on self‐efficacy and QoL remains inconsistent. More adequately powered, well‐designed trials with targeted and theory‐based interventions are required to ascertain findings. Impact: By highlighting the potential of web‐based psychosocial interventions in reducing anxiety and depression among CRC survivors, this review has put forth beneficial information supporting the use and acceptance of web‐based care delivery in light of COVID‐19 restrictions and nationwide lockdowns. Meanwhile, the paucity of empirical support reflects the necessity of more extensive research to test and improve other health outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)"

However, most individuals who meet the criteria for these disorders do not receive any treatment, and only a small portion receive evidence-based care. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are one way to increase access to evidence-based psychological treatments. Evidence supports the efficacy of disorder-specific and transdiagnostic DMHIs based on cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety and depression. Most of these interventions focus on reducing symptoms and negative affect. However, research indicates that deficits in positive affect, a related yet distinct construct, are common across these disorders. The current study reports on the development of an Internet-based version of the unified protocol that also targets positive affect regulation. We also report results from a small initial pilot study (N = 4) on the acceptability of the intervention, preliminary outcomes, and participant feedback used to inform refinements to the program. Participants generally found the program to be acceptable. In terms of preliminary outcomes, there was a statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptoms at the group level from pre- to posttreatment. There were no other statistically significant results at the group level from pre- to posttreatment on stress, depression, savoring, or well-being. However, individual participants reported clinically significant changes in various outcomes. Results also highlight the importance of receiving participant feedback early in the development process.

However, existing reviews lack a detailed overview of effective program elements, including structural features and supporting content. This umbrella review synthesizes the main elements of effective, evidence-based digital programs which facilitate the prevention of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Based on an analysis of 11 existing reviews that describe 45 programs, key components and content contributing to program effectiveness were identified. These included a focus on modular and linear structure, which means organizing the program in a clear and sequential manner. Additionally, approaches based on cognitive behavioral therapy and gamification to engage and motivate users, were identified as effective components. The findings provide a better understanding of what makes digital programs effective, including considerations for sustainability and content, offering valuable insights for the future development of digital programs concerning the prevention of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Critically noted is that the differentiation between prevention and intervention in the program description is not always clear and this could lead to an overestimation of prevention effects.

This research evaluates a “backdoor” approach to early intervention by investigating whether internet cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism can significantly improve disordered eating. Additionally, we investigated whether a more interactive intervention impacted outcomes. Participants were recruited worldwide online; 368 were screened, 172 (46.7%) met inclusion criteria (endorsed high shape, weight, or eating concerns) and randomised to an interactive (Focused Minds Program; FMP) or static PDF intervention (Centre for Clinical Intervention; CCI-P) or waitlisted (control condition). Participants completed assessments on disordered eating, perfectionism, and a range of secondary variables at the end of treatment, and 1- and 3-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that, compared to control, FMP resulted in significantly lower levels of disordered eating at each assessment and CCI-P at the 1- and 3-month follow-up (respective 3-month follow-up between group effect sizes of 0.78 and 0.54). There were no significant differences between the two active interventions on any measure except depression and hated self. Results suggest an alternative approach to directly tackling disordered eating that is low-cost is effective, with a more interactive intervention producing a more rapid effect.

Evidence suggests that therapy can help recovery from self-harm, but little is known about the experiences of those who self-harm and participate in therapy delivered via videoconferencing. Design/methodology/approach: Risk assessments were examined for evidence of self-harm and used to identify two groups for analysis: young people who had self-harmed in the past six months and those who had not. A mixed methods analysis was then conducted to examine process and outcome data for these two groups. Data included a number of sessions attended, late-cancelled and missed without notice; and patient-reported outcome measure scores (Young Person-Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation and Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale). End-of-treatment reports were subsequently analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: Those with current self-harm risk appeared to start therapy with lower well-being. No notable differences in progress were found between groups on quantitative outcomes. There was greater reporting of poorer clinical outcomes in the reports of those with current self-harm risk, including two unique types of barriers to effective therapy: “general difficulties” (e.g. poor well-being limiting engagement, specific components of therapy being challenging) and “CBT was not preferred”. Originality/value: Lower baseline well-being could explain the greater ongoing care needs and lower well-being post-therapy among those with current self-harm risk, despite both groups appearing to make similar levels of therapeutic progress quantitatively. Recent self-harm does not appear to reduce the utility of videoconferencing cognitive behavioural therapy; however, clients’ individual needs should be carefully considered.

Achieving satisfactory levels of patient engagement is a crucial, yet often underexplored, pre-requisite for health improvement. Actissist is a co-produced DHI delivered via a smartphone app for people with early psychosis, based on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy principles. This study describes and compares engagement patterns among participants in the two arms of the Actissist 2.0 randomised controlled trial. Engagement frequency and duration were measured among participants using the Actissist app in the intervention arm ( n = 87) and the ClinTouch symptom monitoring only app used as the control condition ( n = 81). Overall, 47.1 % of Actissist and 45.7 % of ClinTouch users completed at least a third of scheduled alerts while active in the study. The mean frequency (77.1 versus 60.2 total responses) and the median duration (80 versus 75 days until last response) of engagement were not significantly higher among Actissist users compared to ClinTouch users. Older age, White ethnicity, using their own smartphone device and, among Actissist users, an increased sense of therapeutic alliance were significantly associated with increased engagement. Through exploiting detailed usage data, this study identifies possible participant-level and DHI-level predictors of engagement to inform the practical implementation of future DHIs.

However, effective and available interventions primarily targeting low self-esteem are scarce, in particular for youths. To address this gap, the aim of this pilot study was to evaluate a novel internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) program for low self-esteem in adolescents using a randomized controlled design. Fifty-two participants (15-19 years) were recruited and randomly allocated to seven weeks of therapist-supported ICBT (n=26) or to a waitlist control condition (n=26). The primary outcome was the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Secondary outcomes measured domain-specific aspects of self-esteem, self-compassion, quality of life, depression and anxiety. The treatment group showed significantly higher levels of self-rated self-esteem compared to the control group at post-treatment, with a large between-group effect-size (RSES, d = 1.18). Further, the treatment had significant positive impact on secondary measures of self-esteem, self-compassion, quality of life, depression and anxiety. The results of this pilot-RCT suggest that ICBT can be effective for treating low self-esteem in adolescents, decrease depression and anxiety levels, and increasing quality of life.

However, access is restricted due to lack of resources and staff training. Delivering CBT for sleep problems using smartphone technology may facilitate wider access. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and potential usefulness of a guided, smartphone‐based CBT intervention targeting sleep disturbance for individuals with psychosis. Design: Participants with psychosis spectrum diagnoses were recruited to a single‐arm, uncontrolled study and engaged with the seven‐module programme via smartphone app for six weeks with therapist support. Method: Feasibility was assessed by rates of referral, recruitment and completion. Acceptability was assessed by app usage, a satisfaction questionnaire and qualitative analysis of participants’ semi‐structured interview. Pre‐ and post‐intervention assessment of sleep, psychotic experiences, mood, well‐being and functioning was conducted. Mean change confidence intervals were calculated and reported as an indication of usefulness. Results: Fourteen individuals consented to participation, and eleven completed the post‐intervention assessment. On average, each participant engaged with 5.6 of 7 available modules. Qualitative feedback indicated the intervention was considered helpful and would be recommended to others. Suggested improvements to app design were provided by participants. Potential treatment benefits were observed for sleep difficulties, and all outcomes considered, except frequency of hallucinatory experiences. Conclusions: It is feasible and acceptable to deliver therapist‐guided CBT for sleep problems by smartphone app for individuals with psychosis. This method provides a low‐intensity, accessible intervention, which could be offered more routinely. Further research to determine treatment efficacy is warranted.

High sedentary behaviour levels, common after stroke, are associated with poor health and higher levels of mobility disability. The aim of this study was to undertake a behavioural diagnosis of sedentary behaviour in the early phase after stroke to inform interventions that may reduce sedentary behaviour and associated disability. Methods and materials: Independently mobile stroke survivors were interviewed three months after stroke. The topic guide was informed by the central layer of the Behaviour Change Wheel to explore three components: capability, opportunity and motivation. This model recognises that behaviour is the consequence of an interacting system of these components. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using The Framework Method. Results: Thirty one people were interviewed (66.7 years; 16 male). The perception of diminished capability to reduce sedentary behaviour due to physical tiredness/fatigue, and pain/discomfort acting as both a motivator and inhibitor to movement, were discussed. Environmental barriers and the importance of social interaction were highlighted. Perceived motivation to reduce sedentary behaviour was influenced by enjoyment of sedentary behaviours, fear of falling and habitual nature of sedentary behaviours. Conclusions: This information will inform evidence-based sedentary behaviour interventions after stroke. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Käll et al. (see record 2021-74930-008). Käll et al. demonstrated that loneliness, a prevailing risk factor of mental and physical health problems, can improve with psychological interventions. Despite notable differences between internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, both had medium-to-large within-group effect sizes 4 months post-intervention. This encouraging finding indicates that clinical management of loneliness in addition to treatment for depression and anxiety is a possible avenue to prevent elderly suicide. The study aims to examine the role psychological factors play in the link of elderly depression and suicidality. The hypothesis was tested in a sample of Taiwanese elderly outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. Validated Chinese versions of clinician- and self-rating scales were used to evaluate psychiatric dysfunction and psychological factors. State suicidality were significantly correlated with all but two across depression and anxiety, enhanced distress, reduced reward, and impulsivity. To identify the unique effect of each variable on state suicidality, multiple regression analysis was performed, with depression and anxiety, the psychological factors, cognitive functioning, and demographics serving as independent variables simultaneously. Regarding loneliness, the results did not differentiate a lack of social contact per se from perceived rejection. Whether or not an internalized rejection is sufficient for the sense of disconnectedness in suicide remains to be investigated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)"

Some studies have analysed forum messages, showing that users describe a range of advantages, and some disadvantages to their use. However, the direct examination of users’ experiences of such platforms is rare and may be particularly informative for enhancing their helpfulness. This study aimed to understand users’ experiences of the Support, Hope and Recovery Online Network (SHaRON), an online cognitive behavioural therapy-based peer support platform for adults with mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Platform users (n = 88) completed a survey on their use of different platform features, feelings about using the platform, and overall experience. Responses were analysed descriptively and using thematic analysis. Results indicated that most features were generally well used, with the exception of private messaging. Many participants described feeling well supported and finding the information and resources helpful; the majority of recent users (81%) rated it as helpful overall. However, some participants described feeling uncomfortable about posting messages, and others did not find the platform helpful and gave suggestions for improvements. Around half had not used the platform in the past 3 months, for different reasons including feeling better or forgetting about it. Some described that simply knowing it was there was helpful, even without regular use. The findings highlight what is arguably a broader range of user experiences than observed in previous studies, which may have important implications for the enhancement of SHaRON and other platforms. Key learning aims (1) To understand what an online peer support platform is and how this can be used to support users’ mental health. (2) To learn how users described their experience of the SHaRON platform. (3) To understand the benefits that online peer support may provide. (4) To consider what users found helpful and unhelpful, and how this might inform the further development of these platforms.

The majority of older adults reported using the internet/email every day (69.3%), fewer participants reported once a week (8.5%), once a month (2.6%), once every three months (0.7%), less than every three months (1.5%) and never (17.4%). No significant associations were found between internet/email use and loneliness, however, non-linear associations were found for social isolation. Older adults using the internet/email either once a week (odds ratio (OR) = 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.49–0.72) or once a month (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.45–0.80) were significantly less likely to be socially isolated than every day users; those using internet/email less than once every three months were significantly more likely to be socially isolated than every day users (OR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.28–6.40). Once every three months and never users showed no difference in social isolation compared with every day users. Weak associations were found between different online activities and loneliness, and strong associations were found with social isolation. The study updated knowledge of older adults’ internet/email habits, devices used and activities engaged in online. Findings may be important for the design of digital behaviour change interventions in older adults, particularly in groups at risk of or interventions targeting loneliness and/or social isolation.

10.1111/1467-6427.12323,The underuse of couple therapy for depression in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Services (IAPTS): A service evaluation exploring its effectiveness and discussion of systemic barriers to its implementation,"Shepherd, Melanie;Butler, Lucy",Journal of Family Therapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Couple therapy for depression (CTfD) is an intrinsically systemic, behaviourally‐based, interactional model. It is underused despite recommendation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and data from Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Services (IAPTS) demonstrating its effectiveness compared with other therapies. In 2016/17, only 1,842 CTfD interventions were delivered nationally, compared with vastly greater cognitive behavioural therapy and counselling provision (NHS Digital, 2018). Depressed clients’ access to CTfD is extremely restricted. IAPT CTfD service evaluation data for 81 couples indicated good outcomes for CTfD in terms of depression, anxiety and relationship satisfaction, despite mean interventions of 7.27 sessions. Recommendations for addressing the underuse of CTfD include increasing capacity through delivery targets, CTfD promotion and improved referral processes. Strengthened links between IAPTS, CTfD training courses and systemic therapists, and expanding systemic training and supervision, would support CTfD implementation and increase family inclusiveness and patient choice. Depressed clients deserve access to CTfD equivalent to individual therapies. Practitioner points: CTfD is a NICE‐recommended NHS couple therapy with equivalent effectiveness to other IAPT therapies yet is underused. A CTfD service evaluation showed good outcomes for depression, anxiety and relationship satisfaction, despite brief intervention lengths. Leadership, organisational change and training are required for IAPTS to widen patient choice and address barriers to CTfD implementation. Strengthened links between IAPTS and systemic therapists are needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Yet, homework adherence is often low. We developed CBT MobileWork,© a smartphone application (app) to promote CBT skills practice “as-needed.” Methods: We applied a user-centered design in a laboratory setting with 8 depressed patients and 5 therapists for the initial development and testing. We then completed a real-world evaluation of CBT MobileWork© with 15 depressed patients in CBT and their therapists. This report details the prototype development, presents data evaluating feasibility and usability in the lab and real-world, and presents preliminary findings of associated measures. Results: Our data indicates that both patients and therapists reported high levels of satisfaction and rated the application highly usable during testing in both controlled laboratory and under real-world conditions. A moderate association between app use and reductions in depression was found. Conclusions: CBT MobileWork© has preliminary feasibility for CBT skills practice and may benefit patients with CBT homework completion.

However, many people still do not receive effective and timely treatment due to the low availability, accessibility, and acceptability of traditional counseling. In this study, we developed a scalable, effective, and accessible app to address the problems that arise in traditional face-to-face counseling and to treat common psychological problems such as mild depression that people experience in their daily lives. The suggested app features semi-crowdsourced counseling, immediate intervention from multiple counselors, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based short comments, and gamification. In a two-week randomized control trial (RCT), we surveyed 47 college students in their 20 s to investigate the efficacy of the suggested app and found that depression levels were reduced significantly only in the experimental group using the app. In addition, we conducted a user survey to determine which design factors affected the user experience of clients and counselors using the app. The proposed app can be used to help those suffering from mild depression in daily life, and it can also be used as a training aid to enhance counselors’ counseling skills.

10.2196/12599,Technological state of the art of electronic mental health interventions for major depressive disorder: Systematic literature review,"Burger, Franziska;Neerincx, Mark A.;Brinkman, Willem-Paul",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2018.10.24,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Electronic mental (e-mental) health care for depression aims to overcome barriers to and limitations of face-to-face treatment. Owing to the high and growing demand for mental health care, a large number of such information and communication technology systems have been developed in recent years. Consequently, a diverse system landscape formed. Objective: This literature review aims to give an overview of this landscape of e-mental health systems for the prevention and treatment of major depressive disorder, focusing on three main research questions: (1) What types of systems exist? (2) How technologically advanced are these systems? (3) How has the system landscape evolved between 2000 and 2017? Methods: Publications eligible for inclusion described e-mental health software for the prevention or treatment of major depressive disorder. Additionally, the software had to have been evaluated with end users and developed since 2000. After screening, 270 records remained for inclusion. We constructed a taxonomy concerning software systems, their functions, how technologized these were in their realization, and how systems were evaluated, and then, we extracted this information from the included records. We define here as functions any component of the system that delivers either treatment or adherence support to the user. For this coding process, an elaborate classification hierarchy for functions was developed yielding a total of 133 systems with 2163 functions. The systems and their functions were analyzed quantitatively, with a focus on technological realization. Results: There are various types of systems. However, most are delivered on the World Wide Web (76%), and most implement cognitive behavioral therapy techniques (85%). In terms of content, systems contain twice as many treatment functions as adherence support functions, on average. Furthermore, autonomous systems, those not including human guidance, are equally as technologized and have one-third less functions than guided ones. Therefore, lack of guidance is neither compensated with additional functions nor compensated by technologizing functions to a greater degree. Although several high-tech solutions could be found, the average system falls between a purely informational system and one that allows for data entry but without automatically processing these data. Moreover, no clear increase in the technological capabilities of systems showed in the field, between 2000 and 2017, despite a marked growth in system quantity. Finally, more sophisticated systems were evaluated less often in comparative trials than less sophisticated ones (OR 0.59). Conclusions: The findings indicate that when developers create systems, there is a greater focus on implementing therapeutic treatment than adherence support. Although the field is very active, as evidenced by the growing number of systems developed per year, the technological possibilities explored are limited. In addition to allowing developers to compare their system with others, we anticipate that this review will help researchers identify opportunities in the field.

10.1007/s10567-018-0271-8,Technology delivered interventions for depression and anxiety in children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Grist, Rebecca;Croker, Abigail;Denne, Megan;Stallard, Paul",Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Depression and anxiety are common during adolescence. Whilst effective interventions are available treatment services are limited resulting in many adolescents being unable to access effective help. Delivering mental health interventions via technology, such as computers or the internet, offers one potential way to increase access to psychological treatment. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to update previous work and investigate the current evidence for the effect of technology delivered interventions for children and adolescents (aged up to 18 years) with depression and anxiety. A systematic search of eight electronic databases identified 34 randomized controlled trials involving 3113 children and young people aged 6–18. The trials evaluated computerized and internet cognitive behavior therapy programs (CBT: n = 17), computer-delivered attention bias modification programs (ABM: n = 8) cognitive bias modification programs (CBM: n = 3) and other interventions ( n = 6). Our results demonstrated a small effect in favor of technology delivered interventions compared to a waiting list control group: g = 0.45 [95% CI 0.29, 0.60] p &lt; 0.001. CBT interventions yielded a medium effect size ( n = 17, g = 0.66 [95% CI 0.42–0.90] p &lt; 0.001). ABM interventions yielded a small effect size ( n = 8, g = 0.41 [95%CI 0.08–0.73] p &lt; 0.01). CBM and ‘other’ interventions failed to demonstrate a significant benefit over control groups. Type of control condition, problem severity, therapeutic support, parental support, and continuation of other ongoing treatment significantly influenced effect sizes. Our findings suggest there is a benefit in using CBT based technology delivered interventions where access to traditional psychotherapies is limited or delayed.

10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00265,"Be a mom, a web-based intervention to prevent postpartum depression: The enhancement of self-regulatory skills and its association with postpartum depressive symptoms","Fonseca, Ana;Monteiro, Fabiana;Alves, Stephanie;Gorayeb, Ricardo;Canavarro, Maria Cristina",Frontiers in Psychology,,2018.11.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Aim: Be a Mom is a self-guided, web-based intervention to prevent persistent postpartum depression symptoms [PPD], targeting both at-risk postpartum women and/or women presenting early-onset postpartum depressive symptoms (selective/indicated preventive intervention). Be a Mom is grounded on the principles of Cognitive-Behavior Therapy and incorporates the recent contributions of acceptance and compassion-based approaches (third-wave approaches) applied to the perinatal context. This study aimed to explore the processes underlying therapeutic change in the Be a Mom intervention, by: (1) exploring whether participation in the Be a Mom promotes the enhancement of self-regulatory skills (emotion regulation abilities, psychological flexibility and self-compassion) in comparison with women who did not participate in the program; and (2) exploring whether changes in self-regulatory skills are associated with changes in depressive symptoms, among women who participated in the Be a Mom program. Methods: A pilot randomized, two-arm controlled trial was conducted. Eligible women (presenting PPD risk-factors and/or early-onset PPD symptoms) were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to the intervention group (Be a Mom, n = 98) or to the waiting-list control group ( n = 96). Participants in both groups completed baseline (T1) and post-intervention assessments (T2), including measures of depressive symptoms, emotion regulation abilities, psychological flexibility and self-compassion. Results: From baseline to post-intervention assessment, women in the intervention group showed a significantly greater decrease in the levels of emotion regulation difficulties ( p &lt; 0.001) and a significant greater increase in the levels of self-compassion ( p &lt; 0.001) compared to the control group. No significant differences were found concerning psychological flexibility. Moreover, a greater decrease in difficulties in emotion regulation and greater increase in self-compassion levels were significantly associated with a greater decrease in depressive symptoms, among women in the intervention group. Discussion: Be a Mom promotes the enhancement of women’s emotion regulation abilities and self-compassion, and this seems to exert a protective effect in the presence of PPD risk factors (or early-onset symptoms) because it led to a reduction of depressive symptoms. By providing some insights into the processes that underlie treatment response to Be a Mom, this study highlights the important role of the targeted third-wave processes applied to the perinatal context.

Face‐to‐face care has not adequately addressed this global concern due to difficulties in scaling these resources. Internet interventions, which can provide psychological tools to those lacking adequate access, show promise in filling this void. Method: We conducted a 2‐condition proof‐of‐concept pilot randomized trial comparing brief Internet‐based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and brief Internet‐based compassionate mind training (CMT) for women who are currently pregnant, became pregnant within the last year, and intend to become pregnant in the future. Results: We found that, although CMT and CBT demonstrated near equivalence in improving affect, self‐reassurance, self‐criticism, and self‐compassion, CMT showed superiority to CBT in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: These findings provide a compelling initial argument for the use of CMT as an avenue for addressing problems associated with negative affect. Implications, limitations, and future directions along this line of research will also be discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Emerging themes served as the basis for the creation of a quantitative web-based survey, completed by 56 TF-CBT experts, to assess the perceived helpfulness of the recommendations. Technology was perceived as a useful, appealing, and familiar tool that could greatly enhance the delivery of this treatment modality with adolescents. Main recommendations included the creation of a mobile application targeting all of the treatment components and a website with developmentally appropriate resources for providers, caregivers, and teens.

A study of coping and depression,"Shell, Jordana;Beaulieu, Leah;Pothier, Brittany;Dobson, Keith S.;Drapeau, Martin",Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Despite the abundance of data linking coping to well-being and lack of flexible thinking to depression, there remains a need for research investigating the relationship between flexibility in coping and depressive symptoms. The present study aimed to determine if there is indeed a relationship between coping flexibility, defined as an ability to use a greater variety of coping strategies, and depression scores in patients suffering from major depression. Participants were taken from the cognitive–behavioral therapy arm of Jacobson’s landmark study (1996, 2008). Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), coping strategies were identified using the Coping Patterns Rating Scale (CPRS), and coping flexibility was calculated using Gini’s C concentration measure. No significant association was found between flexibility in coping and severity of depression. While flexibility in coping, or lack thereof, is not associated with depression severity, it remains to be seen whether decreased flexibility in coping is different in individuals suffering from depression when compared with non-depressed individuals.

There are a number of reasons for this including, wide availability and acceptability, especially for young people. Examples in an Australasian context, where technological approaches to mental health treatment has been pioneering, are the use of online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs and mobile phone applications to treat depressive symptoms and other mental health difficulties. However, the use of technology in the treatment of psychotic disorders has been less well researched despite similar potential benefits. This may be because there are concerns that people with psychosis will not use technology or even that the technology may exacerbate symptoms, such as paranoia.

10.1186/s40337-017-0174-y,Effects of a cognitive-behavioral exposure-based body image therapy for overweight females with binge eating disorder: A pilot study,"Lewer, Merle;Kosfelder, Joachim;Michalak, Johannes;Schroeder, Dorothea;Nasrawi, Nadia;Vocks, Silja",Journal of Eating Disorders,,2017.4.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Although not part of the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5, body image disturbance seems to be a relevant feature of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) as well as of other eating disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Hence, the aim of the present pilot study was to assess the changeability of body image disturbance in a sample of overweight females with BED by a cognitive-behavioral treatment, directly addressing body image disturbance. Method: Overweight females ( N = 34) with BED were randomized to a manualized body image therapy or a waiting-list control group. The final sample consisted of n = 15 participants in the intervention group and n = 19 in the control group due to two drop-outs in the control condition. Before and after the intervention or the waiting period, respectively, participants filled out a questionnaire battery assessing several body image and eating disorder related features. To quantify the perceptual component of body image disturbance, a digital photo distortion technique based on a picture of each participant taken in a standardized suit was applied. Results: In a two-way ANOVA, significant Time × Group interactions were found for eating and shape concerns, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, depressiveness and low self-esteem. Follow-up t-tests indicated a significant symptom reduction of a generally high magnitude in the intervention group. No significant changes concerning body checking and the estimations of one’s own “real”, “felt” and “ideal” body dimensions were found. Conclusion: The strong symptom reduction in the cognitive-affective component of body image disturbance indicates that an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral body image intervention is a promising treatment module for overweight females with BED, but future research with a larger sample size is needed to quantify possible changes in all components of body image.

Method: Growth mixture modeling was used to identify subgroups of individuals in the trial based on treatment response trajectories. Demographic and baseline characteristics were included to identify correlates of subgroup membership. Results: There were two subgroups based on the trajectories of the Beck Hopelessness Scale. The first subgroup had less symptom severity at baseline, and there was no meaningful difference between the two treatment modalities in change over time. The second subgroup had higher symptom severity at baseline, and individuals who engaged in treatment through the videoconference modality had less symptom improvement than those who underwent the in-office modality. Older participants with higher loneliness and anxiety scores at baseline were more likely to be in the second group. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Treatment of depression using videoconferencing to deliver care to an individual’s home offers opportunities for improved access to services, especially among those who are unwilling or unable to seek in-person treatment. However, videoconferencing may not be appropriate for everyone. An individual’s symptom level, age, and comorbidities are important clinical considerations when selecting an appropriate treatment modality.

Coping With Voices (CWV) is a 10-session, interactive, Web-based CBTp skills program that was developed to meet this need, and was shown to be feasible and associated with reduced severity of auditory hallucinations in a previous pilot study. To more rigorously evaluate this program, a randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the efficacy of CWV to usual care (UC). Method: The trial was conducted with a sample of 37 community mental health center clients with schizophrenia and moderate-to-severe auditory hallucinations, with assessments conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Engagement in and satisfaction with the CWV program were high. Both the CWV and UC groups improved comparably in severity of auditory hallucinations and other symptoms over the treatment and at follow-up. However, participants in the CWV program showed significantly greater increases in social functioning and in knowledge about CBTp. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The results suggest that the CWV program has promise for increasing access to CBTp, and associated benefits in the management of distressing psychotic symptoms and improving social functioning.

Moreover, no studies to date have explored potential mechanisms through which perceived treatment credibility may contribute to therapeutic change. Aims: To address this void, this pilot study investigated associations between patients’ perceptions of treatment credibility and outcome among psychiatric outpatients receiving group CBT for depression. A secondary aim was to determine whether the therapeutic alliance mediated the effect of credibility on treatment outcome. Method: Consecutively admitted outpatients (N = 80) completed measures of credibility, alliance and outcome. Results: Findings indicated that higher ratings of credibility were associated with greater improvement in interpersonal problems, but were unrelated to changes in depression, anxiety and quality of life. We did not find evidence for the alliance serving as a mediator. However, we found a direct relationship between credibility and alliance. Conclusions: Depressed patients who perceive treatment to be more credible may be more likely to engage in meaningful exchanges with fellow group members, thus leading to improvement in interpersonal problems.

However, little is known about TM use in adult cancer patients. The present study aimed to extend knowledge on acceptability of a TM intervention in adult cancer patients; examine factors of those screened and enrolled; and compare recruitment at a large national specialty pharmacy versus community-based cancer clinics. Materials and Methods: Screening, enrollment, and baseline data collected in two randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of TMs on medication adherence or symptom severity in adults prescribed oral anticancer agents were linked. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, t-tests, and generalized linear modeling were used to examine sociodemographics, cancer type and stage, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, social support, and symptoms. Results: The cancer clinics screened 293 patients, 43% were eligible, and 56% consented. The specialty pharmacy screened 169 patients, 72% were eligible, and 74% consented. Mean age was 58 years and did not differ by recruitment setting. Later stage disease (p = 0.01) and higher number of symptoms (p &lt; 0.01), and symptom severity (p = 0.02) and interference (p = 0.01) were observed among patients recruited at the specialty pharmacy. No group differences were found for depression, physical function, cognition, self-efficacy, or social support. Discussion: Adult cancer patients were likely to participate in a TM intervention trial. Recruiting through the specialty pharmacy reached a population with higher cell phone ownership and TM usage; with greater interest in a TM intervention compared to the cancer clinics.

This study used modified experience sampling techniques to examine everyday anxiety and stress in adults with high-functioning autism and to explore the feasibility of delivering real-time stress management techniques using a mobile platform. High levels of anxiety were found to be characterised by worry, confusing thoughts and being alone but was not associated with internal focus, imagery or rumination. Participants reported improved mood and less worry and anxious thinking in the active phase of the study. These results support previous studies indicating that people with high-functioning autism differ in their experience of anxiety and provided preliminary data on the feasibility of real-time stress management. The limitations of this approach are discussed together with considerations for future work in the area of developing clinical interventions on mobile platforms.

To understand the feasibility of using the Internet to deliver behavioral interventions to HIV-positive women, we sought to describe patterns of Internet use for general and health-related purposes and to explore differences between Internet-using and non-using women. From February 2014 to April 2014, 103 women were recruited at six community-based organizations in the Bronx, NY that provide services to HIV-positive persons. Women completed a 30-minute interview and answered a brief survey of socio-demographic factors, risk behavior and clinical characteristics. We performed χ² and Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare Internet users and non-users. Sixty-one percent of participants were current Internet users, most of whom used a personal electronic device (e.g., cellphone/smartphone) to access the Internet. While higher proportions of Internet users were passively engaged (e.g., signed up to receive email updates [42.9%] or watched an online video [58.7%] for health-related purposes), smaller proportions (12.7–15.9%) were involved in more interactive activities such as posting comments, questions, or information about health-related issues in an online discussion or a blog. A majority of Internet non-users (60.0%) expressed interest in going online. Lack of computer or Internet access (37.5%) and Internet navigation skills (37.5%) were the primary reasons for non-use. Compared with non-users, Internet users were more likely to be younger, to have higher socioeconomic status, and to report low health-related social support. Despite having a lower proportion of Internet users in our study than the general population, Internet-using women in our study had relatively high levels of online engagement and went online for both general and health-related purposes. However, Internet-based interventions targeting HIV-positive women will likely need to include providing computer and/or Internet access as well as training participants in how to navigate the Internet.

10.4018/ijcbpl.2015010103,Therapy on the move: The development of a therapeutic smartphone application,"Clough, Bonnie A.;Casey, Leanne M.","International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning",,,Scholarly Journals,English,"The present research investigated the use of a Smartphone App as an adjunct in the treatment of a range of anxiety disorders. The primary aim of the App was to increase client adherence to between session therapy tasks, involving homework practice of a range of skills and tasks known to be associated with successful treatment of anxiety disorders. Homework is an important component of many therapeutic approaches, allowing clients to practise therapeutic skills between sessions, as well as providing continuity between sessions (Freeman &amp; Rosenfield, 2002). Greater client adherence to homework tasks has been associated with improved treatment outcomes, and may be particularly important for reducing the risk of relapse (Scheel, Hanson, &amp; Razzhavaikina, 2004). However, despite the benefits of engagement with homework tasks, client adherence to these activities can often be a significant barrier to treatment (Addis &amp; Jacobson, 2000; Burns &amp; Nolenhoeksema, 1991; Detweiler &amp; Whisman, 1999; Detweiler-Bedell &amp; Whisman, 2005). It is also one area in which the use of adjunctive technologies may have the greatest impact.

This application was designed as an adjunct to face-to-face therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders among adults. The App was developed with the purpose of enhancing client engagement and adherence to between session (homework) tasks to improve maintenance and generalization of therapeutic behaviours.

10.1016/j.schres.2013.01.005,Ecological Momentary Assessment of social functioning in schizophrenia: Impact of performance appraisals and affect on social interactions,"Granholm, Eric;Ben-Zeev, Dror;Fulford, Daniel;Swendsen, Joel",Schizophrenia Research,,2012.8.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Research concerning the complex interplay between factors that contribute to poor social functioning in schizophrenia has been hampered by limitations of traditional measures, most notably the ecological validity and accuracy of retrospective self-report and interview measures. Computerized Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMAc) permits the real-time assessment of relationships between daily life experiences, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In the current study, EMAc was used to record daily social interactions, subjective performance appraisals of these interactions (e.g., “I succeeded/failed”; “I was liked/rejected”), and affect in 145 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants completed electronic questionnaires on a personal digital assistant (PDA) four times per day for one week. Time-lagged multilevel modeling of the data revealed that more positive interaction appraisals at any point in a day were associated with greater positive affect which, in turn, was a strong predictor of more social interactions over subsequent hours. Social functioning, therefore, was linked to positive performance beliefs about social interactions that were associated with greater positive affect. The findings suggest a useful treatment target for cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychosocial interventions that can be used to challenge defeatist beliefs and increase positive affect to enhance social functioning in schizophrenia.

10.1371/journal.pone.0036105,Telephone consultation for improving health of people living with or at risk of HIV: A systematic review,"van Velthoven, Michelle H. M. M. T.;Car, Lorainne Tudor;Car, Josip",PLoS ONE,,2011.8.25,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Low cost, effective interventions are needed to deal with the major global burden of HIV/AIDS. Telephone consultation offers the potential to improve health of people living with HIV/AIDS cost-effectively and to reduce the burden on affected people and health systems. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of telephone consultation for HIV/AIDS care. Methods: We undertook a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature. Two authors independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed the quality of randomized controlled trials which compared telephone interventions with control groups for HIV/AIDS care. Telephone interventions were voice calls with landlines or mobile phones. We present a narrative overview of the results as the obtained trials were highly heterogeneous in design and therefore the data could not be pooled for statistical analysis. Results: The search yielded 3321 citations. Of these, nine studies involving 1162 participants met the inclusion criteria. The telephone was used for giving HIV test results (one trial) and for delivering behavioural interventions aimed at improving mental health (four trials), reducing sexual transmission risk (one trial), improving medication adherence (two trials) and smoking cessation (one trial). Limited effectiveness of the intervention was found in the trial giving HIV test results, in one trial supporting medication adherence and in one trial for smoking cessation by telephone. Conclusions: We found some evidence of the benefits of interventions delivered by telephone for the health of people living with HIV or at risk of HIV. However, only limited conclusions can be drawn as we only found nine studies for five different interventions and they mainly took place in the United States. Nevertheless, given the high penetration of low-cost mobile phones in countries with high HIV endemicity, more evidence is needed on how telephone consultation can aid in the delivery of HIV prevention, treatment and care.

10.2196/58319,Efficacy of a mobile health–based behavioral treatment for lifestyle modification in type 2 diabetes self-management: Greenhabit randomized controlled trial,"Ruiz-Leon, Ana Maria;Casas, Rosa;Castro-Barquero, Sara;Alfaro-González, Sofia;Radeva, Petia;Sacanella, Emilio;Casanovas-Garriga, Francesc;Pérez-Gesalí, Ainhoa;Estruch, Ramon",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2024.3.12,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Enhancing self-management in health care through digital tools is a promising strategy to empower patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve self-care. Objective: This study evaluates whether the Greenhabit (mobile health [mHealth]) behavioral treatment enhances T2D outcomes compared with standard care. Methods: A 12-week, parallel, single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with 123 participants (62/123, 50%, female; mean age 58.25 years, SD 9.46 years) recently diagnosed with T2D. Participants were recruited face-to-face from primary care centers in Barcelona, Spain, between July 2021 and March 2022. They were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) an intervention group (n = 61) instructed to use the Greenhabit mobile app alongside standard care, or (2) a control group (n = 62) who received advice on maintaining a healthy diet and followed standard care. The Greenhabit app incorporates serious gaming technology. Participants received daily messages and challenges focused on promoting a healthy lifestyle, including nutrition, exercise, relaxation, a positive mindset, and a supportive social environment. The app encouraged participants to set weekly goals and awarded points for completing challenges. Data on nutrition, anthropometrics, and blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Questionnaires assessing quality of life, work-life balance, and social environment were administered at baseline and during the final visit. The primary outcomes were HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare changes over time (baseline to 6 weeks and baseline to 12 weeks) between the 2 intervention groups. Analysis of covariance was performed to evaluate changes at 6 and 12 weeks, adjusted for baseline levels of each variable. Multiple contrasts were corrected using a Bonferroni post hoc test. Results: Both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c after 6 and 12 weeks (mean change in the intervention group [n = 50] –0.4%, P &lt; .001 vs –0.3% in the control group [n = 53], P = .001) and in FPG after 6 weeks (mean change in the intervention group –5.3 mg/dL, P = .01 vs control group –5.8 mg/dL, P = .01). At 12 weeks, the intervention group also showed significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean change –4.5, P = .049 and –2.4 mmHg, P = .03, respectively), body weight (mean change –0.8 kg, P = .03), BMI (mean change –0.3 kg/m², P = .03), waist circumference (mean change –1.0 cm, P = .046), and triglyceride concentration (mean change –20.0 mg/dL, P = .03). There was also a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations (mean change 2 mg/dL, P = .049). Finally, improvements were noted in 3 out of the 5 elements of balance: positivity, social environment, and work-life balance. Conclusions: The 12-week intervention with the Greenhabit behavioral treatment mHealth app showed beneficial effects on T2D outcomes and reduced the burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Although larger studies are warranted, these results suggest that mHealth apps can be a promising tool for improving T2D self-management.

10.1371/journal.pone.0307273,"Feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a web-delivered behavioral parent training intervention for rural parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol","Ault, Samantha;Herbell, Kayla;Helsabeck, Nathan;Stephenson, Kevin;Breitenstein, Susan M.;Smith, Laureen M.",PLoS ONE,,2024.1.10,Scholarly Journals,English,"Caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often report higher levels of stress and mental health issues. Support services and parent training programs may help buffer the effects of caring for a child with ASD. However, due to the national lack of trained ASD providers and disparity of ASD support resources available in rural areas, caregivers often go without support. A possible solution to reach caregivers in rural areas is web-based interventions. This paper describes an ongoing pilot study examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects on caregiver well-being and disruptive child behaviors for a web-based parent training program (Attend Behavior) for caregivers of young children (ages 2-11 years old) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) living in rural areas (trial registration NCT05554198). The intervention is available on the internet as well as a downloadable app for mobile phones. Participants will be invited to use the intervention program for 12-weeks. Prior to using the program, participants will be asked to take a baseline survey assessing depressive symptoms (PROMIS Depression Short Form-6a), caregiver stress (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form), child disruptive behaviors (Home Situations Questionnaire-ASD and Aberrant Behavior Checklist). After 12-weeks, participants will be asked to complete a post-intervention survey with the same measurement scales plus questions regarding intervention acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility (Acceptability of Intervention, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure). Participants are also invited to partake in a brief 1:1 interview with a study team member to give further feedback regarding the intervention. Study retention and participant app usage data will be examined. Information generated from this pilot study will be used to inform a future larger scale randomized control trial of Attend Behavior.

The authors regret to inform readers that an error occurred in the listing of one of the authors’ names in the original publication. The name of the fourth author was incorrectly stated as Mu Eob Ahn. The correct name is Moo Eob Ahn. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.] Background: Personalization is considered an important principle in virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy. We aimed to identify whether personalized VR exposure could provoke increased anxiety in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia as it is considered the first step in successful treatment for anxiety. Methods: We performed a double-arm, one-day preliminary study among 28 patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. Three sessions of VR exposure, including a theater, train, and elevator scenario, were conducted in two groups. In the personalized group ( n = 14), the brightness and crowd density were customized based on a pre-assessment. In the control group ( n = 14), these conditions were fully randomized. Self-reported anxiety, heart rate, skin conductance, and electroencephalography were measured before, during, and after the VR sessions. Results: In the later VR sessions, higher self-reported anxiety levels measured by the Visual Analogue Scale were observed in the personalized exposure group. Increased heart rates during and after the VR sessions were observed in the personalized group. The changes in skin conductance peaks were not significantly different between the groups, but the increase in skin conductance was associated with the participants' perception of presence. The electroencephalogram showed widespread increases in alpha waves in the frontal and temporal areas of the brain in the personalized group than in the control group. Conclusion: Personalized VR exposure elicits stronger anxiogenic effects in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia as suggested by self-report and neurophysiological data. Personalization of VR exposure has the potential for effective behavioral therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Understanding what treatments and modalities work, and how people get better through those treatments and modalities, is needed. Methods We include analyses of moderators of treatment outcomes and preliminary processes of change from a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a fully automated website delivering acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy (AEBT) for adults (N = 81) with trichotillomania. All participants received an eight-module website of AEBT, and assessments were completed at baseline, mid-, post-treatment, and a one-month follow-up. Using multilevel modeling, the moderation effects of baseline trichotillomania specific psychological flexibility, age, baseline and time -varying anxiety, and baseline and time varying depression were explored. Preliminary process of change using psychological flexibility was explored. Results Baseline trichotillomania-specific psychological flexibility is correlated with changes in symptom severity over time but not by condition. Lower trichotillomania specific psychological flexibility at baseline was associated with better outcomes. Age also moderated treatment outcomes, specifically, participants between 18 and 30 had better treatment outcomes than participants over 30 years old. Baseline anxiety correlated with symptom severity but did not moderate intervention effects. Changes in anxiety were correlated with symptom severity over time. Baseline depression was not a significant moderator. Preliminary process of change analyses suggests that changes in psychological flexibility is correlated with changes in trichotillomania symptom severity across time. This relationship did not change in strength over time and was not moderated by condition. Conclusion This study highlights how baseline trichotillomania specific psychological flexibility and anxiety impact changes in symptom severity and the function in a website delivered AEBT for adults with trichotillomania. Additionally, it provides preliminary support of the role of trichotillomania-specific psychological flexibility as a process of change in treatment of trichotillomania. Implications are discussed.

10.2196/48991,Self-guided mental health apps targeting racial and ethnic minority groups: Scoping review,"Saad, Fiby;Eisenstadt, Mia;Liverpool, Shaun;Carlsson, Courtney;Vainieri, Isabella",JMIR Mental Health,,2023.5.15,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The use of mental health apps (MHAs) is increasing rapidly. However, little is known about the use of MHAs by racial and ethnic minority groups. Objective: In this review, we aimed to examine the acceptability and effectiveness of MHAs among racial and ethnic minority groups, describe the purposes of using MHAs, identify the barriers to MHA use in racial and ethnic minority groups, and identify the gaps in the literature. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on August 25, 2023, using Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, PsycExtra, and MEDLINE. Articles were quality appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, and data were extracted and summarized to form a narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were primarily conducted in the United States, and the MHAs designed for racial and ethnic minority groups included ¡Aptívate!, iBobbly, AIMhi- Y, BRAVE, Build Your Own Theme Song, Mindful You, Sanadak, and 12 more MHAs used in 1 study. The MHAs were predominantly informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and focused on reducing depressive symptoms. MHAs were considered acceptable for racial and ethnic minority groups; however, engagement rates dropped over time. Only 2 studies quantitatively reported the effectiveness of MHAs among racial and ethnic minority groups. Barriers to use included the repetitiveness of the MHAs, stigma, lack of personalization, and technical issues. Conclusions: Considering the growing interest in MHAs, the available evidence for MHAs for racial and ethnic minority groups appears limited. Although the acceptability seems consistent, more research is needed to support the effectiveness of MHAs. Future research should also prioritize studies to explore the specific needs of racial and ethnic minority groups if MHAs are to be successfully adopted.

10.3928/00485713-20231024-01,The intersection of insomnia disorder and major depressive disorder: A clinical perspective,"Bachu, Anil;Yadav, Garima;Ansari, Maliha;Kochhar, Hansini;Cabrera, Tiffany;Chopra, Amit",Psychiatric Annals,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with profound sleep architectural alterations including reduced slow wave activity, increased delta sleep ratio, REM sleep disinhibition, shortened REM onset latency, and increased REM density. Antidepressants, though mitigating depressive symptoms, often disrupt sleep patterns, highlighting the delicate balance between treatment benefits and sleep-related impacts. Comprehensive assessment and management of insomnia is pivotal due to its significant implications for effective clinical management and treatment outcomes in MDD. Nonpharmacological treatments, notably cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), and digital CBTi (dCBTi) should be considered. CBTi unravels maladaptive sleep beliefs and behaviors, yielding improvements in both insomnia and MDD symptoms. Digital CBTi platforms extend accessibility, offering potential relief to a broader demographic. Sedating antidepressants, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, and atypical antipsychotics address insomnia within MDD, with cautious consideration for side effects. A combination of pharmacotherapy with CBTi might yield augmented outcomes in patients with MDD and comorbid insomnia. Ketamine, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS) explore novel dimensions in treating treatment-resistant depression, potentially influencing sleep disruptions.

The present study aimed to examine the effects of a self-applied computerized program based on SSL that maintains the same objectives and contents as the face-to-face program. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, 75 children (49.3 % female) aged 8–12 years (M age = 9.45, SD = 1.31), selected for exhibiting emotional symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the intervention ( n = 35) or the waiting list control (WLC) group ( n = 40). Pre- and post-intervention data were collected through self-reports and the report of parents who completed parallel versions of the same measures of emotional and behavioral problems. Results: Overall, compared to the WLC group, the intervention group showed positive effects on targeted emotional symptomatology in the short term. Based on parents' reports, a significant reduction was found in outcomes such as anxiety, depression, emotional symptoms, and internalizing problems, while self-reported results were similar except for anxiety. In addition, a positive impact was found on symptoms related to other types of difficulties (e.g., externalizing problems and general difficulties measured). Limitations: Small sample size, non-inclusion of follow-up assessment and other informants (e.g., teachers). Conclusions: In conclusion, this research provides novel and promising data on the self-applied computerized adapted version of the SSL program, within a multi-informant approach, suggesting that it may be a useful tool for the indicated prevention of childhood emotional problems.

10.1111/jsr.13826,A comparison of sleep restriction and sleep compression on objective measures of sleep: A sub‐sample from a large randomised controlled trial,"Rosén, Ann;D'Onofrio, Paolo;Kaldo, Viktor;Åkerstedt, Torbjörn;Jernelöv, Susanna",Journal of Sleep Research,,2022.9.6,Scholarly Journals,English,"Sleep restriction therapy is a central component of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, but can lead to excessive sleepiness, which may impede treatment adherence. Sleep compression therapy has been suggested as a possibly gentler alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of sleep restriction therapy and sleep compression therapy on objective measures of sleep, with a focus on magnitude and timing of effects. From a larger study of participants with insomnia, a sub‐sample of 36 underwent polysomnographic recordings, before being randomised to either sleep restriction ( n = 19) or sleep compression ( n = 17) and receiving online treatment for 10 weeks. Assessments with polysomnography were also carried out after 2, 5, and 10 weeks of treatment. Data were analysed with multilevel linear mixed effect modelling. As per treatment instructions, participants in sleep restriction initially spent shorter time in bed compared with sleep compression. Participants in sleep restriction also showed an initial decrease of total sleep time, which was not seen in the sleep compression group. Both treatments led to improvements in sleep continuity variables, with a tendency for the improvements to come earlier during treatment in sleep restriction. No substantial differences were found between the two treatments 10 weeks after the treatment start. The results indicate that homeostatic sleep pressure may not be as important as a mechanism in sleep compression therapy as in sleep restriction therapy, and an investigation of other mechanisms is needed. In conclusion, the treatments led to similar changes in objective sleep at a somewhat different pace, and possibly through different mechanisms.

When this article was published, it contained an error in one of the paragraphs of text. The corrected text is present in the erratum.] Background Exposure to trauma is common and can have a profoundly negative impact on mental health. Interventions based on trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy have shown promising results to facilitate recovery. The current trial evaluated whether a novel, scalable and digital early version of the intervention, Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure (CIPE), is effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Method A single-site randomised controlled trial with self-referred adults (N = 102) exposed to trauma within the last 2 months. The participants were randomised to 3 weeks of CIPE or a waiting list (WL) for 7 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 1–3 (primary endpoint), week 4–7 (secondary endpoint) and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Results The main analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle indicated statistically significant reductions in symptoms of post-traumatic stress in the CIPE group as compared to the WL group. The between-group effect size was moderate at week 3 (bootstrapped d = 0.70; 95% CI 0.33–1.06) and large at week 7 (bootstrapped d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.46–1.19). Results in the intervention group were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. No severe adverse events were found. Conclusions CIPE is a scalable intervention that may confer early benefits on post-traumatic stress symptoms in survivors of trauma. The next step is to compare this intervention to an active control group and also investigate its effects when implemented in regular care.

People with CVD have higher rates of depression than those without and have higher mortality rates if they have comorbid depression. While physical activity (PA) improves both, few people engage in enough. We compared self-guided internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) + Fitbit or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) + Fitbit, with Fitbit only to increase daily steps for participants with depression who have low PA. Methods: Adult participants ( N = 340) were recruited from two online patient-powered research networks and randomized to one of three study interventions for 8 weeks with an additional 8 weeks of follow-up. Using linear mixed effects models, we evaluated the effect of the intervention on average daily steps (NCT03373110). Results: Average daily steps increased 2.8 steps per day in MBCT + Fitbit, 2.9 steps/day in CBT + Fitbit, but decreased 8.2 steps/day in Fitbit Only. These changes were not statistically different between the MBCT + Fitbit and CBT + Fitbit groups, but were different from Fitbit Only across the initial 8-week period. Group differences were not maintained across follow-up. Exploratory analyses identified comorbid anxiety disorders, self-reported PA, and employment status as moderators. Discussion: Changes in daily steps over both 8- and 16-week periods—regardless of intervention group—were minimal. The results emphasize the limits of using self-guided web-based psychotherapy with an activity tracker to increase PA in participants with a history of depression and low PA.

10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.023,Online psychosocial interventions for improving mental health in people during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Ye, Zhiyu;Li, Wentian;Zhu, Ruizi",Journal of Affective Disorders,,2022.3.2,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions for public mental health were mostly delivered through online modalities. Although many studies have explored the effectiveness of online psychosocial interventions through randomized controlled trials, there is a lack of quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of online psychosocial interventions and an examination of their overall application. Objective: To understand the commonly used psychosocial interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of the interventions. Methods: Risk bias was assessed in the included studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria, and data from post-test and follow-up were combined for standardized mean differences using Stata 16.0 software, and sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis, and risk bias was assessed in the included studies using Review Manager 5.4 software. The study was written in strict accordance with PRISMA specifications, and registration was completed on the PROSPERO platform (CRD42022302917). Results: The online psychosocial intervention had an ameliorating effect on anxiety (SMD = −0.78), depression (SMD = −0.80), and insomnia (SMD = −0.19) in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, was ineffective for the intervention on stress, and the effectiveness of the intervention on depression continued at follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the type of intervention, intervention form, Duration of intervention, and setting of the control group influenced the trial results to some extent, with cognitive behavioral therapy being the most effective intervention for anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-help interventions being more effective than interventions with therapist interventions, and 1–4 week interventions being more effective than 5–8 week interventions. Due to the limited number of studies included in the analysis and variability in quality, more randomized controlled trials are needed to test the findings. Conclusion: Online psychosocial interventions can be effective in improving symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, additional randomized controlled trial studies are needed to determine which types of interventions are more appropriate for which populations and how they can be implemented to achieve better intervention outcomes.

J.",Journal of Youth and Adolescence,,2022.4.12,Scholarly Journals,English,"Adolescents are at increased risk for developing mental health problems. The Grow It! app is an mHealth intervention aimed at preventing mental health problems through improving coping by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-inspired challenges as well as self-monitoring of emotions through Experience Sampling Methods (ESM). Yet, little is known about daily changes in well-being and coping during a stressful period, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed to elucidate daily changes in positive and negative affect, and adaptive coping, and to better understand the within-person’s mechanisms of the Grow It! app. The sample consisted of 12–25-year old Dutch adolescents in two independent cohorts (cohort 1: N = 476, Mage = 16.24, 76.1% female, 88.7% Dutch; cohort 2: N = 814, Mage = 18.45, 82.8% female, 97.2% Dutch). ESM were used to measure daily positive and negative affect and coping (cohort 1: 42 days, 210 assessments per person; cohort 2: 21 days, 105 assessments). The results showed that, on average, adolescents decreased in daily positive affect and adaptive coping, and increased in their experienced negative affect. A positive relation between adaptive coping and positive affect was found, although independent of the CBT-based challenges. Latent class analysis identified two heterogeneous trajectories for both positive and negative affect, indicating that the majority of participants with low to moderate-risk on developing mental health problems were likely to benefit from the Grow It! app. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Both disorders tend to persist, are predictive for other mental disorders, and are associated with severe impairment in diverse areas. Although Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has proven to be an effective treatment, a considerable number of adolescents do not respond to CBT and residual symptoms often remain. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve treatment outcomes for depressed and/or anxious adolescents. Dysfunctional emotion regulation appears to be a transdiagnostic factor in the development and maintenance of aforementioned disorders. Enhancing emotion regulation skills may therefore reduce symptom severity. In light of this, we developed a guided internet-based emotion regulation training (E-TRAIN) that will be added to CBT. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of E-TRAIN + CBT compared to CBT alone on depressive and anxiety outcomes among adolescents with depressive and/or anxiety disorder. Methods: In this multicenter two-arm randomized controlled trial with parallel group design, we aim to include 138 adolescents, aged 13–19 years, referred for treatment and diagnosed with depressive and/or anxiety disorder. Participants will be allocated to either CBT or CBT + E-TRAIN. Assessments will take place at baseline, and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2) and 12 (T3) months after baseline. We will conduct multi-informant assessments: the adolescent, a parent/caregiver, and the CBT therapist will be asked to fill in questionnaires. The continuous primary outcome measure is self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms at six months after baseline, measured with the RCADS25. Secondary outcome measures include anxiety or depression diagnosis based on a semi-structured clinical interview, emotion (dys) regulation, and parent-report measures of anxiety, depression and emotion (dys) regulation. Discussion: This study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the additional value of a guided internet-based emotion regulation training to regular CBT in adolescents with depressive and/or anxiety disorders. If this intervention is effective, it can be implemented in mental health care and improve treatment for these young people.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-82249-001). Background: Depressive symptoms are one of the most common and ever-increasing mental health problems among students worldwide. Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet- and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap. Objective: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help smartphone app (MCT &amp; More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness. Methods: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group ( n = 200), who received access to the self-help smartphone app MCT &amp; More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list control group ( n = 200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy. Results: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F ₁₂₂₂ = 3.98; P = .047; d = 0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: F ₁₂₂₀ = 8.79; P = .003; d = 0.77) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet- and mobile-based interventions ( r = 0.260; P = .004) and the more positive the outcome expectation ( r = 0.236; P = .009), the more frequently the self-help smartphone app was used. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT &amp; More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low-threshold intervention to enhance students’ health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"

This exploratory analysis aimed to identify moderators for the outcome between ICBT for somatic symptom distres and a waitlist control group (WL) in a vulnerable target group of emerging adults. Methods: Based on data from a randomized controlled trial on 156 university students with varying degrees of somatic symptom distress who were allocated to either an eight-week, therapist guided ICBT (iSOMA) or to the WL, we examined pretreatment demographic characteristics, health-related variables (e.g., somatic symptom duration), mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety) and cognitive-emotional factors (emotional reactivity, somatosensory amplification) as candidate moderators of the outcome, somatic symptom distress (assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-15) from pre- to posttreatment. Results: Somatosensory amplification (assessed by the Somatosensory Amplification Scale, SSAS) moderated the outcome in favor of iSOMA ( B = −0.17, SE = 0.08, p = 0.031), i.e., higher pretreatment somatosensory amplification was associated with better outcome in the active compared to the control intervention. No significant moderation effects were found among demographic characteristics, health-related variables, or mental distress. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that an internet-delivered CBT for somatic symptom distress should be preferred over no active treatment particularly in individuals with moderate to high levels of somatosensory amplification, which as a next step should be tested against further treatments and in clinical populations.

This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of current virtual reality interventions for emotional disorders, with a focus on clinical and technological features that influence translation of treatments from research to clinical practice. A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, for studies including the application of a virtual reality intervention to a clinical population of adults with an emotional disorder. Thirty-seven eligible studies were identified, appraised, and assessed for bias. Treatment effects were typically large across studies, with virtual reality being considered an efficacious treatment modality for various anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Virtual reality interventions were typically used for delivering exposure in cognitive behavioural therapy approaches. Considerable variability was seen in cost, technological specifications, degree of therapist involvement, delivery format, dosage, duration, and frequency of treatment. Suboptimal methodological rigour was identified in some studies. Remote use of virtual reality was rare, despite increasing options for in home use. Virtual reality interventions have the potential to overcome barriers to care and better meet the needs of consumers. Future research should examine the efficacy of virtual reality for treatment of depressive disorders and obsesive compulsive disorder. Improved methodological reporting and development of transdiagnostic and remotely delivered virtual reality interventions, will likely increase the translation of this treatment modality.

Methods: This paper details the protocol for a three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a mindfulness-based self-help IMI (arm 1) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based self-help IMI (arm 2) versus being on a waiting list (arm 3) in their effectiveness reducing cannabis use in frequent cannabis users. Predictors of retention, adherence and treatment outcomes will be identified and similarities between the two active intervention arms explored. Both active interventions last six weeks and consist of eight modules designed to reduce cannabis use and common mental health symptoms. With a targeted sample size of n = 210 per treatment arm, data will be collected at baseline immediately before program use is initiated; at six weeks, immediately after program completion; and at three and six months post baseline assessment to assess the retention of any gains achieved during treatment. The primary outcome will be number of days of cannabis use over the preceding 30 days. Secondary outcomes will include further measures of cannabis use and use of other substances, changes in mental health symptoms and mindfulness, client satisfaction, intervention retention and adherence, and adverse effects. Data analysis will follow ITT principles and primarily employ (generalized) linear mixed models. Discussion: This RCT will provide important insights into the effectiveness of an IMI integrating mindfulness to reduce cannabis use in frequent cannabis users.

Video conferencing therapy (VCT) offers an effective solution for logistical barriers to treatment, which has been salient throughout the Coronavirus pandemic. However, research concerning the delivery of CBT via VCT for children and young people (CYP) is in its infancy, and clinical outcome data are limited. The aim of this service evaluation was to explore the effectiveness of a VCT CBT intervention for CYP referred from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in the UK. A total of 989 records of CYP who had completed CBT via VCT in 2020 with Healios, a digital mental health company commissioned by the National Health Service (NHS), were examined to determine changes in anxiety, depression and progress towards personalised goals. Routine outcome measures (ROMs) were completed at baseline and endpoint, as well as session by session. Feedback was collected from CYP and their families at the end of treatment. There was a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression and significant progress towards goals, with pre- to post-effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) demonstrating medium to large effects ( d = .45 to d = −1.39). Reliable improvement ranged from 31 to 80%, clinical improvement ranged from 33 to 50%, and 25% clinically and reliably improved on at least one measure; 92% reported that they would recommend Healios. This service evaluation demonstrates that Healios’ CBT delivered via VCT is effective for CYP receiving it as part of routine mental health care.

Method: This study used a cross-sectional survey design and included individuals with tinnitus enrolled in an Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy trial (n = 439). Study participants provided demographic details, completed various structured questionnaires and provided details about the medications used. The self-reported medications were classified using the United States Pharmacopeial Medicare Model Guidelines v7.0. Results: Current medication use was reported by 67% ( n = 293) of the study participants. Those currently using medication were older; had consulted their primary care physician, had greater tinnitus severity, depression, anxiety, and insomnia when compared with those not reporting any current medication use. The top 10 medication used included cardiovascular agents ( n = 162; 55.3%), antidepressants ( n = 80; 27.3%), electrolytes/minerals/metals/vitamins ( n = 70; 23.9%), respiratory tract/pulmonary agents ( n = 62; 21.2%), anxiolytics ( n = 59; 20.1%), hormonal agents/stimulant/replacement/ modifying (thyroid; n = 45; 15.4%), gastrointestinal agents ( n = 43; 14.7%), analgesics ( n = 33; 11.3%), blood glucose regulators ( n = 32; 10.9%), and anticonvulsants ( n = 26; 8.87%). Some associations between type of medication used and demographic or tinnitus-related variables were noted especially for the cardiovascular agents, electrolytes/minerals/ metals/vitamins, and anxiolytics. Conclusions: This exploratory study indicated a large percentage of patients using medication and a range of medications. Further studies are required to assess the effects of such medications on the tinnitus percept and concurrent medication moderate treatment effects.

Yet, little is known about students' experiences of Internet‐based mental health interventions (also known as e‐interventions) and the acceptability of this mode of treatment in low‐resource settings. Our aims were to investigate South African university students' experiences of using a brief semi‐guided Internet‐based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression and document the acceptability of this mode of psychotherapy. Data were collected via in‐depth semi‐structured interviews with students ( n = 9) who had moderate to moderately severe symptoms of depression (as assessed by the PHQ‐9) and had used a 7 session guided skills‐based iCBT intervention. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis, with the aid of Atlas‐ti software. Participants found the anonymity, privacy and accessibility of iCBT appealing, believing this facilitated use of the intervention and overcame stigma associated with accessing traditional campus counselling services. The intervention was helpful and facilitated self‐disclosure, emotional expression, self‐awareness and skill acquisition. However, students also reported disappointment with the lack of human contact and immediate responsiveness, articulating an expectation that the e‐intervention would mimic face‐to‐face psychotherapy. Moves to incorporate iCBT into student counselling should take account of and manage students' expectations about the ability of e‐interventions to mimic traditional therapy and/or incorporate more opportunities for human interaction.

Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of data on 403 participants from the randomized controlled clinical trial “Online Treatment for Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Primary Care.” It examined the impact of cCBT, with and without access to an Internet support group, on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mood, and anxiety symptoms. Results: High versus low pain interference had a negative effect on response to cCBT for physical HRQoL regardless of high or low optimism level (between group difference = −3.46 [−5.89 to −1.03], p = .005, or −4.06 [−6.28 to −1.85], p &lt; .001, respectively). However, in the context of low optimism/high pain interference only negatively impacted the effect of cCBT on mental HRQoL (3.68 [0.63 to 6.73], p = .018) and anxiety symptoms (−2.61 [−4.87 to −0.35], p = .024). Although the pattern of effects was similar for depressive symptoms, the between-group differences were not significant. Conclusions: High optimism may buffer against the negative effects of pain interference on treatment response from cCBT. Primary care patients who report high pain interference yet also lack optimism may not receive as much benefit from cCBT as other groups. Furthermore, this study found an unexpected positive effect of low optimism on treatment response. For depressed and anxious patients with low pain interference, low optimism enhanced the impact of cCBT on mental HRQoL. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01482806.

We sought to synthesise and assess the quality of the evidence on the feasibility of mHealth-based interventions for depression in Latin America. We conducted a literature search of studies published in 2007 and after using four electronic databases. We included peer-reviewed articles, in English, Spanish or Portuguese, that evaluated interventions for depressive symptoms. Two authors independently extracted data using forms developed a priori. We assessed appropriateness of reporting utilising the CONSORT checklist for feasibility trials. Eight manuscripts were included for full data extraction. Appropriate reporting varied greatly. Most ( n = 6, 75%) of studies were conducted in primary care settings and sought to deliver psychoeducation or behaviour change interventions for depressive symptoms. We found great heterogeneity in the assessment of feasibility. Two studies used comparator conditions. mHealth research for depression in Latin America is scarce. Included studies showed some feasibility despite methodological inconsistencies. Given the dire need for evidence-based mental health interventions in this region, governments and stakeholders must continue promoting and funding research tailored to cultural and population characteristics with subsequent pragmatic clinical trials.

Smartphone-based technologies hold significant potential for further enhancing the accessibility and efficacy of such interventions. Objective: This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a guided, hybrid web-based training program based on cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with symptoms of panic disorder. Methods: Participants ( N = 92) with total scores in the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale ranging from 9 to 28 were recruited from the general population and allocated either to a hybrid intervention (GET.ON Panic) or to a wait-list control group. The primary outcome was the reduction in panic symptoms, as self-assessed using a web-based version of the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale. Results: Analysis of covariance-based intention-to-treat analyses revealed a significantly stronger decrease in panic symptoms posttreatment ( F = 9.77; P = .002; Cohen d = 0.66; 95% CI 0.24-1.08) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of an online culturally adapted CBT-based guided self-help (CaCBT-GSH) for patients with anxiety and depression in Pakistan. This randomized controlled trial recruited 39 participants from primary care in Karachi, Pakistan and randomized them to two groups. The intervention group received seven modules of CaCBT-GSH plus treatment as usual (TAU) over 12 weeks. The control group was a waitlist control plus TAU. The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability. Clinical outcomes included results from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2 (WHODAS 2). Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 12 weeks. All 39 individuals who met eligibility criteria for the study agreed to participate. Adherence to the intervention was excellent, with 85% (17/20) completing more than five modules. Statistically significant improvements were found in all clinical outcomes in the intervention group. This was the first trial of an online CaCBT-GSH intervention, which was found to be feasible and acceptable to Pakistani patients with anxiety and depression. CaCBT-GSH may help improve symptoms, depression, anxiety and overall functioning in this population. The results provide rationale for a larger, confirmatory randomized controlled trial of digital CaCBT-GSH. Key learning aims (1) Leveraging digital and virtual platforms to deliver psychosocial interventions may contribute to addressing the significant treatment gap in low-resource settings. (2) CBT-informed guided self-help is feasible and acceptable in the treatment of common mental disorders in Pakistan. (3) The results of this study merit a larger, appropriately powered confirmatory randomized controlled trial to determine clinical and cost effectiveness.

Methods: Adults ( N = 75) with mild to moderate BED participated in iBED with weekly written support from psychologists. Participants were compared on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE‐Q), diagnostic criteria for BED (BED‐Q), major depression inventory (MDI), quality of life (EQ‐5D‐5L), body mass index (BMI) and sociodemographic variables. Results: Minor differences were observed between completers and noncompleters on depression. No differences were found in BED‐symptoms, BMI, and sociodemographic variables. Participants who completed treatment showed large reductions in eating disorder pathology. Discussion: More research is needed to determine risk factors for attrition or treatment outcome in internet‐based interventions for BED. It is suggested that iBED is an efficient intervention for BED. However, more studies of internet‐interventions are needed.

Although effective, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered by trained professionals is not easily accessible. This randomized trial evaluated the effects of a CBT-based mobile application designed to increase resilience to body image triggers and reduce BID symptoms. Method: A non-clinical sample of women ( N = 90; M age = 23.52) was randomized to use the mobile application for approximately 4 min of daily exercises for two weeks or to a control condition. Body image was measured at baseline, immediately after two weeks of mobile application use, and at 1-month follow-up. To examine whether using the application was associated with increased resilience to common BID triggers, participants completed an Instagram exposure resilience task upon completion and at 1-month follow-up. Results: Relative to those in the control condition, participants who used the application demonstrated increased resiliency and reduced BID symptoms. Theses effects were medium-to-large and were maintained at 1-month follow-up. Conclusion: These results underscore the potential usefulness of brief, low-intensity, portable interventions in reducing BID symptoms and in increasing resilience to thin-ideal body messages often portrayed on social media.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has had a wide range of effects on perinatal mental health. COVID-19 has had widespread effects on perinatal mental health. It is important to thoroughly understand the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, especially in Japan, with its unique practice peculiarities, such as satogaeri childbirth. It is also necessary to enhance the level of support that can be implemented even under the circumstances of COVID-19. Online support is thought to be one of the most optimal options because of its high accessibility and lack of physical contact. We have developed a smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for pregnant women and are conducting a randomized controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of iCBT to prevent the onset of antenatal and post-partum depression.

However, it is unclear whether these factors are relevant in standardized and individualized Internet-based interventions. To investigate this question, a secondary analysis of data from 1,089 mildly to moderately depressed adults undergoing 6 weeks of cognitive–behavioral Internet-based intervention for depression randomized to receive either weekly written feedback individualized by a counselor or automated and fully standardized feedback was performed. The following variables corresponding to the 4 categories were tested regarding associations with depressive symptom change during multiple treatment periods within a multigroup structural equation model: (a) outcome expectations, (b) extratherapeutic stressors and stress change during treatment, (c) midtreatment working alliance (task/goal and bond), and (d) uptake of treatment-specific components (logins and specific tool use). Results suggest similar regressive associations across treatment conditions: Previous symptom change was the most important predictor for subsequent symptom developments. Stress at baseline and the uptake of specific treatment components only played a minor role, and stronger task/goal ratings were associated with later symptom improvements. Early symptom improvements predicted stronger midtreatment task/goal and bond ratings, whereas only stronger task/goal ratings were associated with later symptom improvements. Outcome expectations were only indirectly related with symptom change mediated through goal/task ratings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00782,Why does therapy work? An idiographic approach to explore mechanisms of change over the course of psychotherapy using digital assessments,"Altman, Allison Diamond;Shapiro, Lauren A.;Fisher, Aaron J.",Frontiers in Psychology,,2019.10.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and Objective(s): While psychotherapy treatments are largely effective, the processes and mechanisms underlying such positive changes remain somewhat unknown. Focusing on a single participant from a treatment outcome study that used a modular-based cognitive behavior therapy protocol, this article aims to answer this question by identifying changes in specific symptomatology over the course of the treatment. Using quantitative data derived from digital health methodology, we analyzed whether a given therapeutic intervention was related to downstream effects in predicted symptom domains, to assess the accuracy of our interventions. Methods: This case study employed an observational N-of-1 study design. The participant ( n = 1) was a female in the age range of 25–35 years. Using digital health data from ambulatory assessment surveys completed prior to and during therapy, separate linear regression analyses were conducted to assess if hypothesized treatment targets reduced after a given module, or intervention. Results: Support was found for some of the hypothesized quantitative changes (e.g., decreases in avoidance after exposures module), yet not for others (e.g., decreases in rumination following the mindfulness module).

10.1177/2043808719842502,A randomized controlled trial of Internet-delivered CBT and attention bias modification for early intervention of depression,"McDermott, Rebecca;Dozois, David J. A.",Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,,2018.4.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"The conceptualization and empirical knowledge base related to major depression has increased dramatically in recent years. We now have well-developed and validated models of depression from a range of theoretical perspectives. These models have significantly enhanced the development of effective treatments and preventative interventions. Although various prevention programs are available, Web-based protocols can enhance accessibility to evidence-based prevention programs. The current study involved a randomized controlled trial focused on the prevention and treatment of depression in high-risk first- and second-year undergraduate students. Three Internet-delivered preventative programs were compared: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; MoodGym), attentional bias modification, and an active attentional control condition. Participants ( n = 350) completed symptom measurement pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks) and again at a 4-month follow-up, when they were also administered a structured diagnostic interview. Participants in the CBT condition showed more dramatic and continuous depressive symptom improvement between baseline and follow-up than did participants in the other two conditions. In addition, significantly fewer individuals in CBT condition met diagnostic criteria for major depression at follow-up than in the other conditions. These findings have important implications for future early intervention research and practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Two major challenges to delivery of high-quality care are providers’ fidelity to evidence-based treatment models and children’s and caregivers’ engagement in the treatment process. We developed a novel, tablet-based application designed to enhance via technology the quality of delivery of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). We piloted its use in four community mental health service organizations using a blocked randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility of implementing tablet-facilitated TF-CBT versus standard TF-CBT with 13 providers and 27 families. Provider fidelity and child engagement in treatment were observationally measured via session audio recording. Parent and child perceptions of the tablet application were assessed using structured interviews and mixed-method analyses. Providers actively and appropriately used tablet TF-CBT to facilitate treatment activities. Providers and families expressed high satisfaction with its use, demonstrating acceptability of this approach. Youth and caregivers in both conditions reported high alliance with their providers. Overall, we found that tablet-facilitated treatment is accepted by providers and families and may be integrated into mental health treatment with minimal training. Further study is needed to examine the extent to which technology-based applications may enhance the reach, quality, and clinical outcomes of mental health treatment delivered to children and families.

We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 116 English-speaking adolescents (ages 13–17 years), presenting to the ED for any reason, who reported past-year physical peer violence and current depressive symptoms. The cognitive–behavioral therapy- and motivational interviewing-based intervention consisted of a brief in-ED intervention session and 8 weeks of automated text-message daily mood queries and tailored responses. The control was a brief in-ED presentation and twice-weekly text messages on healthy behaviors. Follow-up was conducted at 8 and 16 weeks. Descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, mixed-effects longitudinal regression models, and latent class models (LCMs) were calculated. iDOVE had high acceptability and feasibility, with 86% of eligible youth consenting (n = 116), 95% completing 8-week follow-up, and 91% completing 16-week follow-up. High quantitative and qualitative satisfaction were reported by intervention and control participants. Comparing intervention to control, improved depressive symptoms (p = .07) and physical peer violence (p = .01) were observed among the more symptomatic youth in the intervention group (but no difference in symptoms between full intervention and control groups). LCMs showed that intervention responsiveness correlated with lower mood (measured through daily text messages) at Day 7 of the intervention. This RCT of a technology-augmented intervention shows high feasibility and acceptability and a promising signal of reduced violence among the highest-risk participants.

Methods: We recruited 87 people with IGD and a control group of 87 people without a history of IGD. All participants underwent a diagnostic interview based on the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , IGD and GAD criteria, and completed a questionnaire on behavior inhibition, depression, and anxiety. Results: Logistic regression revealed that adults with GAD were more likely (odds ratio = 8.11, 95% CI = 1.78−37.09) to have IGD than those without it. The OR decreased when controlling for behavior inhibition. IGD subjects with GAD had higher depressive and anxiety score than those without GAD. Conclusions: GAD was associated with IGD. Comorbid GAD can contribute to higher emotional difficulty. GAD should be well-assessed and interventions planned when treating young adults with IGD. Behavioral inhibition confounds the association between GAD and IGD. Further study is necessary to evaluate how to intervene in behavioral inhibitions to attenuate the risk of GAD and IGD comorbidity.

Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer. Aims: To show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivo. Method: Participants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure ( n = 17), in vivo exposure ( n = 22) or waiting list ( n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. Results: Improvements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure. Conclusions: Using VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient, cost-effective and practical medium of exposure.

First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based and “serious” motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change.

The goal of the present study is to put CP to a first empirical testing. Method: I present a case of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia comorbid with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) that did not respond to conventional, standard cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT). Using a single- case pre-test/post-test design, a CP approach was developed drawing heavily on existentialist and philosophy- oriented writers. Results: The client responded well to this novel treatment approach. Above all, levels of intolerance of uncertainty improved greatly from pre—to post-treatment. A decrease in overall illness severity as well as specific psychopathological variables such as obsessive–compulsive symptoms, depression and anxiety could be observed. Conclusion: Results are discussed in terms of the underlying mechanism of the CP approach. An account of the underlying mechanism of efficacy, understood as a tripartite function, is introduced. CP as a philosophy- oriented method within the broader framework of third wave CBT and existential analysis is considered.

In this case study, interoceptive exposure (IE) therapy and in vivo exposure therapy were used to treat a 30-year-old housebound woman. Following in-home assessment, psychoeducation, and a limited number of exposure sessions, clinical services were transitioned from in-home to using videoconferencing until in vivo exposure sessions began outside the home. The client was able to meet all behavioral goals by the end of treatment and no longer met criteria for PD/A. This case demonstrates the treatment effectiveness in an individual. Future research should seek to conduct randomized control trials to determine whether videoconference is an efficacious method of delivery for PD/A.

E.",Computers in Human Behavior,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The increasing use of new technologies and virtual communication involving personal computers (PCs), tablets and mobile phones are causing changes in individuals' daily habits and behavior. We report the case of an individual with social phobia who developed a dependency on communication through virtual environments (i.e., nomophobia), and used a PC as a form of relating to the outside world to reduce stress and to avoid direct social relations. Nomophobia refers to the discomfort or anxiety caused by the non-availability of a mobile phone, PC or any another virtual communication device. Social phobia is described as an anxiety disorder of chronic evolution. Objective: To study nomophobia as a manifest behavior that might serve as an indication of a possible anxiety disorder. Methodology: The treatment consisted of the use of medication, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and the application of evaluation tools (interviews, scales, inventories and questionnaires). Results: The individual responded satisfactorily to medication and CBT treatment, which reduced his time using the PC and increased his exposure to real-life situations. Conclusion: Nomophobic behavior produces changes in daily habits and can reveal other aspects to be investigated, such as the presence of comorbid mental disorders.

The existing literature does not report the development and testing of a multicomponent digital intervention to address safety and health issues among immigrant women with cumulative exposures to violence. This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated preliminary efficacy of a multicomponent digital intervention (BSHAPE) to improve health and safety outcomes for immigrant women with cumulative violence exposures, posttraumatic stress disorder and/or depression symptoms, and human immune deficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors. Method: The intervention was developed based on formative qualitative work and input from women. In the randomized controlled trial, 144 Black immigrant women, average age being 33.6 years, were randomly assigned to either the BSHAPE arm ( n = 72) or a control arm ( n = 72). Data were collected at four time points over 12 months. A generalized estimating equation analysis was performed to examine group differences in change in outcomes over time. Results: Compared to the control arm, participants in BSHAPE showed significant improvement in multiple outcome measures (e.g., HIV/STI risk). Conclusion: This pilot trial of BSHAPE showed promising results for immigrant women with lifetime exposures to violence, poor mental health, and HIV risk. The study also provided useful information to further improve BSHAPE for a full-scale efficacy trial. The digital BSHAPE can be especially advantageous for violence-affected immigrant women who face numerous barriers to accessing in-person care for their safety and health needs.

However, the effectiveness and acceptability of IBIs for various mental health disorders continue to be subject to scholarly debate. We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses (MAs), conducting literature searches in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane and Ovid Medline from their inception to 17 January 2023. A total of 87 MAs, reporting on 1683 randomised controlled trials and 295 589 patients, were included. The results indicated that IBIs had a moderate effect on anxiety disorder (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.53, 95%CI 0.44 to 0.62) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (SMD = 0.63, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.89). In contrast, the efficacy on depression (SMD = 0.45, 95%CI 0.39 to 0.52), addiction (SMD = 0.23, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.31), suicidal ideation (SMD = 0.23, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.30), stress (SMD = 0.41, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.48) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (SMD = 0.47, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.73) was relatively small. However, no significant effects were observed for personality disorders (SMD = 0.07, 95%CI −0.13 to 0.26). Our findings suggest a significant association between IBIs and improved mental health outcomes, with particular effectiveness noted in treating anxiety disorders and PTSD. However, it is noteworthy that the effectiveness of IBIs was impacted by high dropout rates during treatment. Furthermore, our results indicated that guided IBIs proved to be more effective than unguided ones, playing a positive role in reducing dropout rates and enhancing patient adherence rates.

However, prior research has been limited by reliance on cross-sectional designs and retrospective trait measures of emotion regulation. The present study used ecological momentary assessment to test associations between polyvictimization and emotion regulation in daily life. Method: After completing a baseline survey assessing trauma exposure, mental health symptoms, and trait emotion regulation, undergraduates ( N = 122) completed smartphone surveys assessing state emotion regulation four times per day for 14 days. Results: Low correspondence was observed between trait and state measures of emotion regulation. After accounting for baseline mental health symptoms, polyvictimization independently predicted lower scores on an aggregative measure of putatively adaptive strategies (i.e., reappraisal, acceptance, problem solving) in daily life. However, polyvictimization did not predict aggregate scores of putatively maladaptive strategies (i.e., cognitive and expressive suppression, rumination, impulsive behavior, avoidance). Baseline depression and posttraumatic stress predicted higher use of putatively maladaptive strategies. Conclusions: Results suggest polyvictimization may be associated with less use of adaptive emotion regulation in daily life, whereas mental health symptoms may be associated with more use of maladaptive strategies. These findings highlight the utility of experience sampling approaches for increasing insight into emotion regulation difficulties among trauma survivors.

Mobile health can provide interventions that address adverse health behaviors for individuals in a vulnerable health state in real-world settings (just-in-time adaptive intervention). Objective: This study aims to identify a subpopulation with vulnerable sleep state in daily life (study 1) and, immediately afterward, to test whether providing mobile health intervention improved habitual sleep behaviors and psychological wellness in real-world settings by conducting a microrandomized trial (study 2). Methods: Japanese workers (n = 182) were instructed to collect data on their habitual sleep behaviors and momentary symptoms (including depressive mood, anxiety, and subjective sleep quality) using digital devices in a real-world setting. In study 1, we calculated intraindividual mean and variability of sleep hours, midpoint of sleep, and sleep efficiency to characterize their habitual sleep behaviors. In study 2, we designed and conducted a sleep just-in-time adaptive intervention, which delivered objective push-type sleep feedback messages to improve their sleep hours for a subset of participants in study 1 (n = 81). The feedback messages were generated based on their sleep data measured on previous nights and were randomly sent to participants with a 50% chance for each day (microrandomization). Results: In study 1, we applied hierarchical clustering to dichotomize the population into 2 clusters (group A and group B) and found that group B was characterized by unstable habitual sleep behaviors (large intraindividual variabilities). In addition, linear mixed-effect models showed that the interindividual variability of sleep hours was significantly associated with depressive mood (β = 3.83; P = .004), anxiety (β = 5.70; P = .03), and subjective sleep quality (β = −3.37; P = .03). In study 2, we found that providing sleep feedback prolonged subsequent sleep hours (increasing up to 40 min; P = .01), and this effect lasted for up to 7 days. Overall, the stability of sleep hours in study 2 was significantly improved among participants in group B compared with the participants in study 1 ( P = .001). Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that providing sleep feedback can benefit the modification of habitual sleep behaviors in a microrandomized trial. The findings of this study encourage the use of digitalized health intervention that uses real-time health monitoring and personalized feedback.

This study aimed to (a) examine the maintenance of behavior improvement approximately 1 year after completing I-InTERACT-North and (b) assess moderating variables associated with treatment outcomes. Families were recruited based on their prior participation in I-InTERACT-North between 2019 and 2022 at the Hospital for Sick Children. Participants completed the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) to assess child behavior problems and intensity. Changes in ECBI Intensity and Problem Scores were analyzed across pre-, post-, and 1-year follow-up assessments using one-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA)s. Mixed-effect ANOVAs considered the impact of proposed moderator variables (i.e., parental education, baseline parental stress, child’s baseline behavior, diagnosis, age, and gender). Of 66 families who completed I-InTERACT-North, 37 (56%) were included in the 12-month follow-up study. Children included were 3–10 years old at follow-up (M = 7.70, SD = 1.82) diagnosed with neurological only (29.73%), neurodevelopmental only (35.14%), or comorbid neurological and/or neurodevelopmental conditions (35.14%). Among all participants, ECBI Problem Scores were significantly lower immediately postintervention but not 1 year later. Baseline ECBI Scores moderated treatment success, such that children with higher baseline scores (i.e., higher initial symptoms) demonstrated improvements in both ECBI Intensity and Problem Scores immediately postintervention, which were maintained at 1-year follow-up. No other variables moderated treatment outcomes. The maintenance of improvement in those with higher initial symptoms suggests a promising targeted application for this telepsychology intervention.

10.1177/1357633X221084584,Effectiveness of iFightDepression® online guided self-help tool in depression: A pilot study,"Varga, Anna;Czeglédi, Edit;Tóth, Mónika Ditta;Purebl, György",Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,,2021.9.23,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depression is one of the leading causes of human misery and disability worldwide. For those fortunate enough to have access to the rapidly expanding World Wide Web, online self-help tools can guide those suffering from depression, with or without professional intervention, to better manage their symptoms and maintain some measure of self-actualization. This study assesses the efficacy of the widely used, online self-help tool, iFightDepression®. Methods: A six-week, observational study was conducted with 143 participants (29.4% men, mean age: 37.8; standard deviation [ SD ] = 12.05, range = 18–70, years) in three intervention groups, as follows: 1) Treatment As Usual (TAU), 2) TAU combined with access to the iFightDepression® tool (TAU+iFD®), 3) TAU combined with iFightDepression® and weekly phone support (TAU+iFD®+phone). Depression symptoms were measured pre- and post- by Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Results: There was a significantly greater decrease of depressive symptoms in both iFD® groups compared to the TAU group (time×group interaction: F (2) =3 4.657, p &lt; 0.001, partial η² = 0.331). The reliable change index calculation identified one participant (0.7%) as having experienced a statistically reliable deterioration in depression. A total of 102 participants (71.3%) showed no reliable change, while 40 participants (28.0%) showed a statistically reliable improvement. Multiple binary logistic regression analysis found odds of reliable improvement to be significantly higher in both iFD® groups compared to the TAU group (TAU+iFD®: OR = 18.52, p = 0.015, TAU+iFD®+Phone: OR=126.72, p &lt; 0.001). Participants living in Budapest were found to have significantly higher odds for a reliable improvement compared to those living in the countryside (odds ratio [OR] =4.04, p=0.023). Finally, higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline (pretest) were also associated with increased odds for post-intervention improvement (OR = 1.58, p &lt; 0.001). The variance explained by the model is 62.0%. With regards to the iFD® self-help program, the mean of completed modules was 4.8 ( SD = 1.73, range = 1–6). Participants in the group supported by weekly phone calls completed significantly more modules (n=50, M = 5.7, SD = 0.76) than participants without weekly telephone support ( n = 52, M = 3.9, SD=1.94, Z = 5.253, p &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the number of completed modules between respondents with a reliable improvement in depression ( n = 39, M = 4.9, SD = 1.57) and those without a reliable change ( n = 63, M = 4.7, SD = 1.83, Z = 0.343, p = 0.731). Conclusion: Our results confirm previous findings regarding the efficacy of web-based interventions with the low-intensity guidance of mental health professional. Findings suggest that a relatively short additional weekly call may result in a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and higher number of completed iFD® modules. The study confirms that the IFD® tool, both alone and with additional phone support, is a possible and effective way to help patients with mild to moderate and, in some cases, even severe depression. Providing mental and primary health care systems with the availability of online self-help tools may contribute to the efficacious treatment of depression and prevention of the increase in depressive symptoms.

A systematic review with meta-analyses,"Raeside, Rebecca;Jia, Si Si;Todd, Allyson;Hyun, Karice;Singleton, Anna;Gardner, Lauren A.;Champion, Katrina E.;Redfern, Julie;Partridge, Stephanie R.",Adolescent Research Review,,2023.5.16,Scholarly Journals,English,"Research has established associations between poor mental health and lifestyle risk behaviors among adolescents, yet gaps exist in understanding whether digital health interventions for adolescents targeting these behaviors will improve mental health and wellbeing. This study aimed to evaluate how effective digital health interventions targeting lifestyle risk behaviors are in improving mental health/wellbeing among adolescents (10–24 years old). We also aimed to understand how effects vary by participant and intervention characteristics, and intervention adherence and engagement. Through systematic review with meta-analysis, 5229 records were identified. 17 studies were included representing 9070 participants (15.3 mean age, 1.2 SD). Interventions had small but statistically non-significant positive effects on physical and psychosocial quality of life, depressive symptoms and anxiety at follow-up compared to usual care controls. Digital health delivery methods included text messaging, mobile applications, websites and email, or a combination of these. Intervention adherence, engagement and satisfaction were measured poorly across studies. Despite small changes, potential exists for digital health interventions to improve mental health or wellbeing outcomes among adolescents due to the shared nature of risk and protective factors for mental health and chronic diseases.

In treatment, self-esteem cannot always be adequately addressed. Internet-based interventions offer a low-threshold and cost-efficient possibility for treating body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Aims: For this reason, we conducted two studies to explore the effectiveness of an internet-based intervention targeting improving self-esteem in adults with BDD symptoms. Method: The first study investigated the differential effects of a 1-week self-esteem training compared with a 1-week attention-focus training. Two hundred twenty adults with elevated body dysmorphic symptoms were randomly assigned to one of the two trainings. Our second study ( n = 58 adults with body dysmorphic symptoms) evaluated an extended 2-week stand-alone self-esteem training. Results: In the first study, self-esteem in different domains (appearance, performance and social), self-focused attention, and BDD symptom severity improved in both groups. Other-focused attention only increased in the attention training group. Participants’ overall adherence was high. In the second study we observed significant improvements in self-esteem, BDD symptom severity, and other secondary outcomes, with additional improvements in most outcomes in the second week. Adherence was again high. Conclusions: Together, these findings show that a brief internet-based intervention may be a highly accepted and effective way of improving self-esteem in people suffering from BDD symptoms.

Patients suffering from depressive disorders report a lower quality of life (QOL) than people without a history of mental health issues. Internet-based interventions (IBIs) based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are effective in reducing symptom severity but data on their impact on quality of life in clinically depressed patients so far is scarce. Methods Selfapy is a CBT-based IBI for depressive disorders. 401 participants (332 female, mean age 37 (SD = 11) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia were enrolled in a randomized, parallel, three-arm trial comparing a therapist-guided Selfapy intervention with an unguided Selfapy intervention and a waiting list control. QOL was measured using the WHOQOL-BREF at baseline, post-treatment (12 weeks) and at 24-week follow-up. The effects of the interventions on QOL were calculated using linear mixed effects models. Results At post-treatment (12 weeks) the guided and unguided intervention groups reported an increase in QOL on physical and psychological health domains compared to controls (significant group*time interaction). The gain in QOL was maintained over the follow-up period only for psychological health. QOL decreased in the social relationships and environment domains over the course of treatment and during the follow-up treatment for all participants. There were no differences between the guided and the unguided intervention. Conclusion Selfapy proved to positively affect psychological and physical QOL in a sample of participants suffering from depressive disorders and can therefore be considered an effective and highly scalable therapeutic tool. The pattern of results might partly be attributable to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures that coincided with the trial.

Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is effective in reducing alcohol misuse; however, the literature investigating how treatment outcomes are impacted by patients’ preferences for therapist- versus self-guided ICBT for alcohol misuse is sparse. Methods: In this preference trial, 74 eligible patients (who reported ≥ 14 drinks in the previous week and obtained scores suggesting hazardous or harmful drinking) chose between enrolling in either therapist- or self-guided ICBT for alcohol misuse. We investigated whether those who chose therapist- versus self-guided ICBT differed in their (a) drinking outcomes—as measured by Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) and heavy drinking days (HDD) at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up—and (b) post-treatment ICBT engagement and satisfaction. Results: The majority (81.1%) of eligible patients chose therapist-guided ICBT. These patients reported higher psychotropic medication use, drinking difficulties, and anxiety symptoms. For both the therapist- and self-guided patients, a modified intention-to-treat analysis revealed large within-group treatment effects for TLFB (β = − 2.64, SE 0.66; p &lt; 0.001) and HDD (β = − 0.34, SE 0.07; p &lt; 0.001), with large pre-to-post-treatment Cohen’s effect sizes of d = 0.97 (95% CI [0.49, 1.45]) for TLFB and d = 1.19 (95% CI [0.69, 1.68]) for HDD. The interaction comparing the effects of therapist- to self-guided ICBT over time was not significant for TLFB (p = 0.34) or HDD (p = 0.06). With treatment, for both therapist- and self-guided patients, there was a significant improvement in drinking difficulties, cravings, and confidence with controlling cravings, as well as in anxiety, depression, and functional impairment. Further, the majority (75.7%) of patients completed five or more lessons, as well as reported overall satisfaction with the treatment (88.9%) and increased confidence in managing their symptoms (86.7%); these outcomes also did not differ between therapist- and self-guided patients. Conclusions: The current study shows that ICBT for alcohol misuse is associated with reduced drinking and comorbid mental health difficulties over time, irrespective of whether patients chose to complete the course on their own or with therapist guidance.

As PSU is consistently linked to mental health issues, measures to prevent its appearance and to promote mental health are urgently required. Subject and Methods: The present study investigated the impact of three interventions on health behavior, PSU, positive mental health (PMH), and depression and anxiety symptoms. Overall, 503 persons from Germany ( M age = 29.19, SD age = 10.51, range: 18–79) participated in the study. Over 14 days, the three experimental groups (a) reduced their daily smartphone use time by 60 minutes, (b) increased their daily level of physical activity by 30 minutes, and (c) combined both measures. The control group continued its behavior as usual. Outcomes were assessed via online surveys at five measurement time points (baseline, intermediate, post-intervention, and 1 and 3 months after the intervention). Results: All interventions resulted in a significant increase in weekly physical activity and in reduced symptoms of PSU, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, the smartphone reduction and the combination of both measures contributed to a significant reduction of participants’ daily smartphone use and higher levels of PMH. The effects of the reduction of smartphone use time and its combination with increased physical activity were more stable in the longer term than the increase in physical activity only. Conclusion: Combined with an increase in physical activity, the reduction of smartphone use time could serve as an efficient and cost-effective measure for the prevention of PSU and the promotion of mental health.

10.1037/pri0000240,"Wider, faster, more: Reenvisioning depression treatment research in the United States","Lorenzo-Luaces, Lorenzo;Fite, Robert E.",Practice Innovations,,2023.11.29,Scholarly Journals,English,"Depression is among the top 10 leading causes of disability in the United States and worldwide. Although there are effective interventions, the burden of disability attributable to depression is not decreasing and has not decreased even in places where treatment availability has increased. Contemporary research efforts have a focus on treatment development and the identification of biomarkers of psychophysiology or treatment response. These potential solutions are not scalable because depression is more common than usually appreciated, and there are substantial disparities in access to mental health care. Improving the dissemination of individual interventions may also be of limited value given data suggesting that high rates of symptom remission can only be achieved with multiple (e.g., 4–10) treatment steps. The logic of stepped care approaches for depression is well supported by these data, but “stepping up” should occur more quickly than usually done in most trials and treatment needs to include both low-intensity (e.g., self-guided app) as well as very high-intensity treatments (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy or ECT). Efforts that promise to make an impact in the public health burden of depression need to consider its high prevalence and the heterogeneity in the level of care needed as well as the different mechanisms that treatments may need to engage. A model of research by lone principal investigators or small teams is unlikely to make a substantial impact on the public health burden of depression because no individual is likely to have the expertise to study radically different treatments like self-guided apps and ECT.

The appendix of original article has been corrected.] Background: Anxiety problems are common in children, yet few affected children access evidence-based treatment. Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. Methods: We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5–12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale–parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0·33 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. Findings: Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (&lt; 1%) other, and one (&lt; 1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9·20 years (SD 1·79). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0·01, 95% CI –0·15 to 0·17; p &lt; 0·0001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual. OSI plus therapist support was likely to be cost effective under certain scenarios, but uncertainty was high. OSI plus therapist support acceptability was good. No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation: Digitally augmented intervention brought promising savings without compromising outcomes and as such presents a valuable tool for increasing access to psychological therapies and meeting the demand for treatment of child anxiety problems.

10.1016/j.jbtep.2023.101922,An investigation of the potential clinical utility of critical slowing down as an early warning sign for recurrence of depression,"Tonge, Natasha A.;Miller, J. Philip;Kharasch, Evan D.;Lenze, Eric J.;Rodebaugh, Thomas L.",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,2022.9.6,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and objectives: Much of the burden of depressive illness is due to relapses that occur after treatment into remission. Prediction of an individual's imminent depressive relapse could lead to just-in-time interventions to prevent relapse, reducing depression's substantial burden of disability, costs, and suicide risk. Increasingly strong relationships in the form of autocorrelations between depressive symptoms, a signal of a phenomenon described as critical slowing down (CSD), have been proposed as a means of predicting relapse. Methods: In the current study, four participants in remission from depression, one of whom relapsed, responded to daily smartphone surveys with depression symptoms. We used p-technique factor analysis to identify depression factors from over 100 survey responses. We then tested for the presence of CSD using time-varying vector autoregression and detrended fluctuation analysis. Results: We found evidence that CSD provided an early warning sign for depression in the participant who relapsed, but we also detected false positive indications of CSD in participants who did not relapse. Results from time-varying vector autoregression and detrended fluctuation analysis were not in agreement. Limitations: Limitations include use of secondary data and a small number of participants with daily responding to a subset of depression symptoms. Conclusions: CSD provides a compelling framework for predicting depressive relapse and future research should focus on improving detection of early warning signs reliably. Improving early detection methods for depression is clinically significant, as it would allow for the development of just-in-time interventions.

Comorbidities are frequent, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) reaches 50%. Family environment is crucial for the severity of behaviors and for prognosis. In middle-income countries, access to treatment is challenging, with more untreated children than those under treatment. Face-to-face behavioral parent training (PT) is a well-established intervention to improve child behavior and parenting. Method: A clinical trial was designed to compare PT-online and face-to-face effects to a waiting list group. Outcomes were the ADHD and ODD symptoms, parental stress and styles, and quality of life. Families were allocated into three groups: standard treatment (ST), ST + PT online, and ST + Face-to-Face PT. We used repeated measures ANOVA for pre × post treatment analysis corrected for multiple comparisons. Results and discussion: Parent training was effective in reducing symptoms of ADHD (p = 0.030) and ODD (p = 0.026) irrespective of modality (p = 1.000). The combination of ST and PT was also associated with better quality of life in the physical domain for patients (p = 0.009) and their parents (p = 0.050). In addition to preliminary data, online intervention seems effective for parenting and improving social acceptance of children. The potential to reach many by an online strategy with a self-directed platform may imply effectiveness with a low cost for public health to support parents’ symptoms management.

Text messaging is one promising medium for increasing access and sustaining user engagement with DMHIs. This paper examines the Small Steps SMS program, an 8-week, automated, adaptive text message-based intervention for depression and anxiety. Methods: We conducted an 8-week longitudinal usability test of the Small Steps SMS program, recruiting 20 participants who met criteria for major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. Participants used the automated intervention for 8 weeks and completed symptom severity and usability self-report surveys after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention use. Participants also completed individual interviews to provide feedback on the intervention. Results: Participants responded to automated messages on 70 % of study days and with 85 % of participants sending responses to messages in the 8th week of use. Usability surpassed established cutoffs for software that is considered acceptable. Depression symptom severity decreased significantly over the usability test, but reductions in anxiety symptoms were not significant. Participants noted key areas for improvement including addressing message volume, aligning message scheduling to individuals' availability, and increasing the customizability of content. Limitations: This study does not contain a control group. Conclusions: An 8-week automated interactive text messaging intervention, Small Steps SMS, demonstrates promise with regard to being a feasible, usable, and engaging method to deliver daily mental health support to individuals with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Primary care patients with depression are less likely to be exposed to psychosocial interventions, despite evidence suggesting many of these treatments are effective. An example is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a behavioral treatment for depression with a growing evidence base. A self-guided ACT intervention with a peer narrative (i.e. storytelling) format was developed with the intention of creating a treatment option for primary care patients that was more accessible than traditional psychotherapy. Titled LifeStories , the online program features videos of real individuals sharing coping skills for depression based on lived experiences and key ACT principles. A total of 93 primary care patients taking antidepressants were randomized to either continued antidepressant treatment alone or antidepressant treatment plus LifeStories for 4 weeks. There were no differences over time on depression severity and psychological inflexibility. However, LifeStories led to greater improvements in quality of life and increased patients’ interest in additional treatment compared to antidepressant medication alone.

The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a therapist-supported 6-week internet-delivered intervention in improving stress recovery among healthcare workers compared to a group with optional therapist support. A total of 196 participants were recruited and randomly allocated to regular therapists’ support or optional therapists’ support groups. The primary outcome measure was the Recovery Experiences Questionnaire (REQ), developed to assess four components of stress recovery: psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control. Secondary outcomes measured perceived stress (PSS-10), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and psychological well-being (WHO-5). All four stress recovery skills improved significantly after participating in the intervention at a 3-month follow-up, with small to medium effects (0.27–0.65) in both groups. At follow-up, we also found a significant reduction in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety in both groups, as well as an improvement in psychological well-being. The results indicate that ICBT can be effective in improving stress recovery skills among healthcare workers with optional support from the therapist, provided at the participants’ request. This RCT suggests that optional therapist support could meet participants’ needs and reduce resources needed in routine care.

The current study used data from 907 Chinese adolescents to develop and validate the 12-item Generic Scale of Being Phubbed (GSBP) and 12-item Generic Scale of Phubbing (GSP) and explored the relationship between being phubbed and phubbing. The serial mediating role of psychological distress and problematic smartphone use in the relationship was examined. The exploratory structural equation modeling results revealed good construct validity for the three-factor 12-item GSBP and the four-factor 12-item GSP. Reliability and validity analyses revealed that the short versions of the scales had good construct reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Being phubbed was positively correlated with phubbing. The mediation model showed that psychological distress and problematic smartphone use serially mediated the relationship between being phubbed and phubbing. The current findings provide brief and valid instruments for the measurement of being phubbed and phubbing, as well as implications for the prevention and intervention of phubbing behaviors in adolescents.

J.;Lavender, Isobel;Mackinnon, Andrew;Glozier, Nicholas;Bryant, Richard;Christensen, Helen;Harvey, Samuel B.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2023.1.25,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: There is increasing evidence that depression can be prevented; however, universal approaches have had limited success. Appropriate targeting of interventions to at-risk populations has been shown to have potential, but how to selectively determine at-risk individuals remains unclear. Workplace stress is a risk factor for depression and a target for intervention, but few interventions exist to prevent depression among workers at risk due to heightened stress. Objective: This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone-based intervention in reducing the onset of depression and improving related outcomes in workers experiencing at least moderate levels of stress. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants who were currently employed and reported no clinically significant depression and at least moderate stress. The intervention group (n = 1053) were assigned Anchored, a 30-day self-directed smartphone app-based cognitive behavioral- and mindfulness-based intervention. The attention-control group (n = 1031) were assigned a psychoeducation website. Assessment was performed via web-based self-report questionnaires at baseline and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month postbaseline time points. The primary outcome was new depression caseness aggregated over the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes included depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, well-being, resilience, work performance, work-related burnout, and quality of life. Analyses were conducted within an intention-to-treat framework using mixed modeling. Results: There was no significant between-group difference in new depression caseness (z score = 0.69; P = .49); however, those in the Anchored arm had significantly greater depressive symptom reduction at 1 month (Cohen d = 0.02; P = .049) and 6 months (Cohen d = 0.08; P = .03). Anchored participants also showed significantly greater reduction in anxiety symptoms at 1 month (Cohen d = 0.07; P = .04) and increased work performance at 1 month (Cohen d = 0.07; P = .008) and 6 months (Cohen d = 0.13; P = .01), compared with controls. Notably, for Anchored participants completing at least two-thirds of the intervention, there was a significantly lower rate of depression onset (1.1%, 95% CI 0.0%-3.7%) compared with controls (9.0%, 95% CI 6.8%-12.3%) at 1 month (z score = 4.50; P &lt; .001). Significant small to medium effect sizes for most secondary outcomes were seen in the highly engaged Anchored users compared with controls, with effects maintained at the 6-month follow-up for depressive symptoms, well-being, stress, and quality of life. Conclusions: Anchored was associated with a small comparative reduction in depressive symptoms compared with controls, although selective prevention of case-level depression was not observed in the intention-to-treat analysis. When users adequately engaged with the app, significant findings pertaining to depression prevention, overall symptom reduction, and functional improvement were found, compared with controls. There is a need for a greater focus on engagement techniques in future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1111/add.16157,The efficacy of an internet‐based cognitive behavioral program added to treatment‐as‐usual for alcohol‐dependent patients in primary care: A randomized controlled trial,"Hyland, Karin;Hammarberg, Anders;Hedman‐Lagerlöf, Erik;Johansson, Magnus;Lindner, Philip;Andreasson, Sven",Addiction,,2022.4.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and Aims: Most alcohol-dependent people have a moderate level of dependence. General practitioners (GPs) hesitate to engage in this area, and need to have access to treatment they find applicable and feasible to use. The aim of this present study was to test if an open-ended internet-based cognitive–behavioral therapy (iCBT) program added to treatment-as-usual (TAU) is more effective than TAU-only for alcoholdependent patients in primary care. Design, Setting and Participants: The present study was a two-group, parallel, randomized controlled superiority trial comparing iCBT+TAU versus TAU-only at 3- and 12-month follow-ups. TAU was delivered at 14 primary care centers in Stockholm, Sweden. A total of 264 patients (mean age 51 years, of whom 148 were female and 116 were male) with alcohol dependence and hazardous alcohol consumption were enrolled between September 2017 and November 2019. Measurements: Participants were randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to iCBT, as a self-help intervention added to TAU (n = 132) or to TAU-only (n = 132). The GPs gave participants in both treatment arms feedback on the assessments and biomarkers and offered TAU at the primary care center. Primary outcome was weekly alcohol consumption in g/week at 12-month follow-up, analyzed according to intention-to-treat (n = 132 + 132). The per-protocol analysis included participants who completed at least one module of iCBT (n = 102 + 132). Findings: There was no significant difference in weekly alcohol consumption between iCBT+TAU and TAU in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis at 12-month follow-up [iCBT +TAU = 133.56 (95% confidence interval, CI = 100.94–166.19) and TAU = 176.20 (95% CI = 144.04–208.35), P = 0.068, d = 0.23]. In the per-protocol analysis, including only those who initiated iCBT, the iCBT+TAU group showed lower mean weekly alcohol consumption compared with TAU [iCBT+TAU = 107.46 (95% CI = 71.17–143.74), TAU = 176.00 (95% CI = 144.21–207.80), P = 0.010, d = 0.42]. Conclusions: In Sweden, an internet-based cognitive–behavioral program added to treatment-as-usual to reduce alcohol consumption showed weak evidence of a benefit at 12 months in the intention-to-treat analysis and good evidence of a benefit in the per-protocol analysis.

10.2196/43164,Mobile acceptance and commitment therapy in bipolar disorder: Microrandomized trial,"Cochran, Amy;Maronge, Jacob M.;Victory, Amanda;Hoel, Sydney;McInnis, Melvin G.;Thomas, Emily B. K.",JMIR Mental Health,,2022.10.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Mobile interventions promise to fill in gaps in care with their broad reach and flexible delivery. Objective: Our goal was to investigate delivery of a mobile version of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for individuals with bipolar disorder (BP). Methods: Individuals with BP (n=30) participated in a 6-week microrandomized trial. Twice daily, participants logged symptoms in the app and were repeatedly randomized (or not) to receive an ACT intervention. Self-reported behavior and mood were measured as the energy devoted to moving toward valued domains or away from difficult emotions and with depressive d and manic m scores from the digital survey of mood in BP survey (digiBP). Results: Participants completed an average of 66% of in-app assessments. Interventions did not significantly impact the average toward energy or away energy but did significantly increase the average manic score m ( P =.008) and depressive score d ( P =.02). This was driven by increased fidgeting and irritability and interventions focused on increasing awareness of internal experiences. Conclusions: The findings of the study do not support a larger study on the mobile ACT in BP but have significant implications for future studies seeking mobile therapy for individuals with BP.

10.1177/26350106221136495,Sleep-opt-in: A randomized controlled pilot study to improve sleep and glycemic variability in adults with type 1 diabetes,"Martyn-Nemeth, Pamela;Duffecy, Jennifer;Quinn, Laurie;Steffen, Alana;Baron, Kelly;Chapagai, Swaty;Burke, Larisa;Reutrakul, Sirimon",The Science of Diabetes Self-management and Care,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a technology-assisted behavioral sleep intervention (Sleep-Opt-In) and to examine the effects of Sleep-Opt-In on sleep duration and regularity, glucose indices, and patient-reported outcomes. Short sleep duration and irregular sleep schedules are associated with reduced glycemic control and greater glycemic variability. Methods: A randomized controlled parallel-arm pilot study was employed. Adults with type 1 diabetes (n = 14) were recruited from the Midwest and randomized 3:2 to the sleep-optimization (Sleep-Opt-In) or Healthy Living attention control group. Sleep-Opt-In was an 8-week, remotely delivered intervention consisting of digital lessons, sleep tracker, and weekly coaching phone calls by a trained sleep coach. Assessments of sleep (actigraphy), glucose (A1C, continuous glucose monitoring), and patient-reported outcomes (questionnaires for daytime sleepiness, fatigue, diabetes distress, and depressive mood) were completed at baseline and at completion of the intervention. Results: Sleep-Opt-In was feasible and acceptable. Those in Sleep-Opt-In with objectively confirmed short or irregular sleep demonstrated an improvement in sleep regularity (25 minutes), reduced glycemic variability (3.2%), and improved time in range (6.9%) compared to the Healthy Living attention control group. Patient-reported outcomes improved only for the Sleep-Opt-In group. Fatigue and depressive mood improved compared to the control. Conclusions: Sleep-Opt-In is feasible, acceptable, and promising for further evaluation as a means to improve sleep duration or regularity in the population of people with type 1 diabetes.

Yet Inuit are also among the least likely of all youth in Canada to seek help when experiencing distress. This troubling reality highlights the need for an exploration of self-administered and discreet therapeutic interventions. Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-Factor thoughts (SPARX) is a cognitive–behavioral therapy-based serious game, developed with Māori youth in New Zealand and designed to address depressive symptoms. Inuit wisdom and the scientific literature emphasize the need for any intervention to integrate evidence-based approaches with Inuit-specific cultural practices. Accordingly, to reflect on SPARX’s cultural appropriateness in their communities, 11 Inuit youth and seven community facilitators participated in semistructured individual, paired, and focus group exit interviews. Participant feedback suggested that the program was engaging and promising as an intervention to improve mood and cognitive coping; however, youth also highlighted the need for a culturally appropriate adaptation of SPARX. By weaving Inuit culture into the game, they felt SPARX could be used to foster community resilience, cultural pride, and youth capacity and engagement while building mental health literacy. Overcoming systemic obstacles to mental health support for Inuit youth in Canada requires innovative, youth-centered approaches. SPARX represents one potential strategy.

Q.;Khoo, Shuna S.;Yang, Sujin",Current Psychology: A Journal for Diverse Perspectives on Diverse Psychological Issues,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Given that crucial psychological attributes of smartphone addiction have been studied in isolation from each other, we examined latent profiles of emotional distress (depression, stress, loneliness, and fear of missing out; i.e., FoMO); protective traits (self-control, mindfulness, grit); the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and approach system (BAS; drive, reward responsiveness, and fun seeking) in relation to addictive smartphone use. We identified three distinctive profiles, using five fit statistics: AIC, BIC, adjusted BIC, an entropy, and LRT. The self-controlled, gritty, and mindful profile (22.7%) was characterized by heightened levels of self-control, grit, and mindfulness but lower levels of emotional distress, BIS, and BAS. The emotionally distressed profile (29.8%) was distinguished by elevated levels of depression, stress, loneliness, FoMO, and BIS, but relatively lower protective traits and BAS. Lastly, the approach sensitive profile (47.5%) corresponded to the normative group characterized by relatively higher BAS but mostly average levels of emotional distress and protective traits. When both global and pairwise comparisons between profiles were performed using Wald tests, we found that the self-controlled, gritty, and mindful profile was associated with significantly lower smartphone addiction tendencies than emotionally distressed or approach sensitive profiles, while the latter two did not differ from each other. These results still held when multiple covariates (age, sex, and income) were controlled for. Using a sophisticated person-centered approach, our findings underscore multidimensional psychological profiles that have different associations with smartphone addiction.

10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.035,Longitudinal associations of the duration of mobile phone use with suicidal behavior in adolescents: The mediating role of depressive symptoms,"Zhang, Ying-Ying;Liu, Zhen-Zhen;Liu, Bao-Peng;Yang, Xiao-Fan;Wan, Li-Peng;Liu, Xianchen;Jia, Cun-Xian",Journal of Affective Disorders,,2022.4.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Prolonged mobile phone use has been demonstrated to be associated with mental health problems and suicidal behavior in adolescents. This study examined the mediating role of depressive symptoms in the association between duration of mobile phone use (DMPU) and suicidal behavior in adolescents. Methods: A total of 6,923 participants from the Shandong Adolescent Behavior &amp; Health Cohort (SABHC) were included in the analysis. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess DMPU on weekdays and weekends, mental disorders, insomnia symptoms, depressive symptoms, suicidal behavior (thought, plan, or attempt), and family demographics in November–December 2015. One year later, a follow-up survey was conducted to ask participants to report their depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior. Path analyses with logistic regressions were performed to examine the mediating role of depressive symptoms in the DMPU-suicidal behavior link. Results: Of the sample, mean age was 14.58 (SD = 1.45) and 3,455 (49.9 %) were female at baseline. 12.12 % of participants reported having ever suicidal behavior during the past 12 months at baseline, and 10.63 % reported having ever suicidal behavior during 1-year follow-up. Path analyses showed that the depressive symptoms played a partial mediating role in the association of DMPU on weekdays and weekends with subsequent suicidal behavior. After controlling for covariates, depressive symptoms accounted for 33.6 % and 58.6 % of the total effect of DMPU on weekdays and weekends on suicidal behavior, respectively. Limitation: All variables were measured based on self-report. Conclusions: The link between DMPU and suicidal behavior was partially mediated by depressive symptoms. Prolonged mobile phone use and depressive symptoms should be assessed and intervened to prevent suicidal behavior in adolescents.

L.;Bhattacharjya, Sutanuka;Fong, Mandy W. M.;Nicol, Ginger E.;Lenze, Eric J.;Baum, Carolyn;Hardi, Angela;Wong, Alex W. K.",Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,,2020.5.20,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: This study aimed to (a) review what theories have been applied to the development of digital self-management interventions for people with neurological disorders; (b) examine their effectiveness to improve depression, anxiety, fatigue and self-efficacy; and (c) identify the optimal mode of intervention delivery. Methods: Electronic databases (SCOPUS, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Clinicaltrials.gov) were searched. Two investigators independently screened studies and extracted data. Study quality and use of theory were also assessed. Results: A total of 944 studies were screened, and 16 randomised controlled trials were included. Theory-based digital self-management interventions were effective in reducing depression (standardised mean difference (SMD) = –0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) –1.04 to –0.49), anxiety (SMD = –0.88, 95% CI –1.54 to –0.21) and fatigue (SMD = –0.62, 95% CI –0.96 to –0.27) and in enhancing self-efficacy (SMD = 1.15, 95% CI 0.11–2.18). Cognitive–behavioural theory (CBT)-based interventions were effective in reducing depression (SMD = –0.81, 95% CI –1.22 to –0.39), anxiety (SMD = –1.15, 95% CI –1.85 to –0.44) and fatigue (SMD = –0.75, 95% CI –0.97 to –0.54) and in improving self-efficacy (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI 0.63–1.05), whereas social cognitive theory (SCT)-based interventions were effective in reducing depression (SMD = –0.73, 95% CI –1.17 to –0.28). Partially digital interventions were more effective than fully digital interventions. Discussion: Our findings support the use of theory to guide the development of digital self-management interventions to increase intervention effectiveness. In particular, CBT-based interventions have a positive impact on depression, anxiety, fatigue and self-efficacy, whereas SCT-based interventions have a positive impact on depression.

10.5014/ajot.2022.048587,An internet-based self-management intervention to reduce fatigue among people with traumatic brain injury: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Raina, Ketki D.;Morse, Jennifer Q.;Chisholm, Denise;Whyte, Ellen M.;Terhorst, Lauren",American Journal of Occupational Therapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Importance: Fatigue is a chronic and distressing sequela of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Little evidence exists for the efficacy of interventions that address post-TBI fatigue. Objective: To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a self-management intervention (Maximizing Energy; MAX) for reducing the impact (primary outcome) and severity of fatigue on daily life, improving fatigue experience, and increasing participation compared with a health education (HE) intervention. Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Setting: Community. Participants: Forty-one participants randomly assigned to the MAX ( n = 20) or HE ( n = 21) intervention. Interventions: The MAX intervention included problem-solving therapy with energy conservation education to teach participants fatigue management. The HE intervention included diet, exercise, and energy conservation education. Both interventions (30 min/day, 2 days/wk for 8 wk) were delivered online by occupational therapists. Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome was the modified Fatigue Impact Scale (mFIS). Outcome measures were collected at baseline, postintervention, and 4- and 8-wk postintervention. Results: At 8 wk postintervention, participants in the MAX group reported significantly lower levels of fatigue impact (mFIS) than those in the HE group, F (1, 107) = 29.54, p = .01; Cohen’s d = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [0.18, 1.55]. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings provide preliminary evidence that the MAX intervention may decrease the impact of fatigue on daily life among people with post-TBI fatigue. What This Article Adds: An internet-based, self-management intervention combining occupational therapy–delivered energy conservation education with cognitive–behavioral therapy seems to reduce fatigue impact and severity among people with post-TBI fatigue. Future appropriately powered RCTs could positively contribute to the evidence available to occupational therapy practitioners for this chronic, debilitating, and often overlooked symptom.

In the original article, there were some errors. The corrections are given in the erratum.] Aims: To synthesize the effectiveness of web‐based psychosocial interventions on self‐efficacy, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), non‐specific psychological and cancer‐specific distress among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Design: A systematic review and meta‐analysis. Data sources: Six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and CNKI) were searched from inception to December 2021. Review methods: Experimental/quasi‐experimental studies involving patients with CRC for the improvement of aforementioned outcomes were included. Two reviewers screened and extracted the data, and assessed studies' methodological quality using risk of bias tools. Meta‐analyses and narrative syntheses were performed. Results: Nineteen studies consisting of 1386 participants were identified. Cognitive‐behavioural therapy delivered online was the most common trialled web‐based psychosocial intervention. Meta‐analyses revealed no positive effect for self‐efficacy (standardized mean difference 0.93, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.35, p &lt; .01) and minimal benefit for QoL (mean difference [MD] 2.83, 95% CI: −0.31 to 5.98, p = .08) but significant positive effects for anxiety (MD −2.23, 95% CI: −3.31 to −1.14, p &lt; .01) and depression (MD −2.84, 95% CI: −4.09 to −1.59, p &lt; .01) among CRC survivors in the intervention group as compared with the control group. Narrative synthesis suggested possible benefits in reducing distress. Conclusion: Web‐based psychosocial interventions are promising alternatives to conventional delivery methods in reducing patients' anxiety, depression and distress. However, evidence on self‐efficacy and QoL remains inconsistent. More adequately powered, well‐designed trials with targeted and theory‐based interventions are required to ascertain findings. Impact: By highlighting the potential of web‐based psychosocial interventions in reducing anxiety and depression among CRC survivors, this review has put forth beneficial information supporting the use and acceptance of web‐based care delivery in light of COVID‐19 restrictions and nationwide lockdowns. Meanwhile, the paucity of empirical support reflects the necessity of more extensive research to test and improve other health outcomes.

For these, a cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 766 Chinese undergraduate students (74.4% female; M = 20.1 years, SD = 1.15) who were measured with their levels of stress, academic burnout, smartphone use types (social/process smartphone use), resilience, and problematic smartphone use. Based on the I-PACE theory, we built a structural equation model, and the results indicated that compared with social smartphone use, process smartphone use more related to problematic smartphone use; academic burnout fully mediated between stress and process smartphone use, and between stress and problematic smartphone use. Moreover, resilience moderated between stress and academic burnout, between academic burnout and process smartphone use, and between academic burnout and problematic smartphone use. We discuss the process smartphone use as a key indicator of problematic smartphone use and the role of academic burnout for linking stress and smartphone use behaviors. In addition, interventions for enhancing resilience should be launched in the future. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1177/00048674211025695,Short-term outcomes of the therapist-assisted Online Parenting Strategies intervention for parents of adolescents treated for anxiety and/or depression: A single-arm double-baseline trial,"Khor, Sarah Pheik Hoon;Fulgoni, Catherine Margaret;Lewis, Deborah;Melvin, Glenn A.;Jorm, Anthony F.;Lawrence, Katherine;Bei, Bei;Yap, Marie Bee Hui",Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate whether the Therapist-assisted Online Parenting Strategies programme increased parenting behaviours known to be supportive of adolescents experiencing anxiety and/or depression. Secondary parenting outcomes of parental self-efficacy, parental accommodation, carer burden, parent–adolescent attachment, family functioning and parent distress were also examined, along with adolescent outcomes of anxiety and depression symptoms, suicidal ideation and sleep. Method: Seventy-one parents (94.4% females) and their adolescents (73.2% females) aged 12–18 years (M ean = 15.02, SD = 1.56) being treated for depression and/or anxiety in Australia were recruited into a single-arm double-baseline open-label trial. Parents received Therapist-assisted Online Parenting Strategies, which comprised up to nine web-based modules each supplemented with coaching sessions via videoconferencing. Outcomes were analysed using latent growth curve modelling to determine if changes to outcomes at post-intervention (4 month post-second baseline) exceeded changes between two baselines measured 1 month apart. Results: Sixty-five parents (91.6%) completed at least one module of the online parenting intervention and on average received nine coaching sessions (SD = 2). Parenting behaviours targeted by Therapist-assisted Online Parenting Strategies improved at post-intervention (Cohen’s d = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [0.78, 1.51]). Parent-reported parental self-efficacy and parent−adolescent attachment increased (Cohen’s d = 1.44 [1.05, 1.82] and 0.39 [0.05, 0.74], respectively), while impairments to family functioning and parent distress decreased (Cohen’s d = −0.51 [−0.86, −0.16] and −0.84 [−1.23, −0.44], respectively). Changes to adolescent anxiety, depression and sleep were not significant. Conclusion: The Therapist-assisted Online Parenting Strategies intervention improved self-reported parenting behaviours, parental self-efficacy, parent levels of distress, parent–adolescent attachment, and family functioning in parents with adolescents being treated for anxiety and/or depression. However, significant changes in adolescent mental health and sleep outcomes at post-intervention were not observed. The usefulness of a therapist-supported online parenting programme in addressing a service gap for parents seeking professional help is indicated.

Given this emergency, the Dominican Republic intervened to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic, considering the physical isolation decreed in the country. In this context, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo and the School of Psychology designed the UASD COVID‐19 Psychological Helpline. The objective of this article is to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a programme of psychological first aid. The programme aimed to attenuate the impact of morbidity and mortality due to mental health issues associated with the COVID‐19 pandemic through mobile technology. There were 62 psychologists involved and trained to provide care, and a protocol was developed, implemented, monitored and evaluated. Over the course of four months, the programme assisted 497 people. The average age of the participants was 32 years, and 73% were women. The reasons for contacting the helpline included anxiety, stress, depression, domestic violence, suicidal behaviours and other behavioural problems. Following the intervention, most users reported feeling satisfied and having improved emotions. The first psychological aid in the country developed through telephone and chat messaging was an optimal resource since face‐to‐face interaction was not possible. It also reached more people and reduced the attention gap. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.2196/29787,The effects of a web-based tool for parents of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Randomized controlled trial,"Mulligan, Kathleen;Hirani, Shashivadan P.;Harris, Sally;Taylor, Jo;Wedderburn, Lucy R.;Newman, Stanton",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2021.4.20,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of autoinflammatory diseases that cause pain and disability if not controlled by treatment. Parenting a child with JIA is stressful for parents, who express concerns about their child’s treatment and may experience anxiety and powerlessness concerning their child’s illness. Parenting stress is greater in parents of children with chronic illness than in those with healthy children and is related to poorer psychological adjustment in both parents and children. It is therefore important to develop interventions to support parents. This paper reports the evaluation of a web-based tool that provides information and practical skills to help increase parents’ confidence in managing their child’s illness and reduce parenting stress. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits of a web-based tool (WebParC) for parents of children with recently diagnosed JIA. Methods: A multicentered randomized controlled trial was conducted at pediatric rheumatology centers in England. We recruited parents of children aged ≤ 12 years who had been diagnosed with JIA within the previous 6 months. They were randomized to the intervention (WebParC access plus standard care) or the control (standard care alone) and followed up 4 months and 12 months after randomization. Where both parents participated, they were randomized by household to the same trial arm. The WebParC intervention consists of information about JIA and its treatment plus a toolkit, based on cognitive behavioral therapy, to help parents develop skills to manage JIA-related issues. The primary outcome was the self-report Pediatric Inventory for Parents measure of illness-related parenting stress. The secondary outcomes were parental mood, self-efficacy, coping, effectiveness of participation in their child’s health care, satisfaction with health care, and child’s health-related quality of life. Results: A total of 203 households comprising 220 parents were randomized to the intervention (100/203, 49.3%) or control (103/203, 50.7%) arm. Follow-up assessments were completed by 65.5% (133/203) of the households at 4 months (intervention 60/100, 60%, and control 73/103, 70.9%) and 61.1% (124/203) of the households at 12 months (intervention 58/100, 58%, and control 66/103, 64.1%). A main effect of the trial arm was found on the Pediatric Inventory for Parents: the intervention participants reported less frequency (subscales communication F 1,120627 = 5.37; P = .02, and role function F 1,27203 = 5.40; P = .02) and difficulty (subscales communication F 1,2237 = 7.43; P = .006, medical care F 1,2907 = 4.04; P = .04, and role function F 1,821 = 4.37, P = .04) regarding illness-related stressful events than the control participants. Conclusions: The WebParC website for parents of children with JIA reduced illness-related parenting stress. This web-based intervention offers a feasible preventive approach for parents of children with JIA and potentially could be adapted and evaluated for parents of children with other chronic illnesses.

BreatheWell Wear assists performance of breathing exercises through reminders, biofeedback, and visual, tactile, and auditory guidance. Objective: To evaluate feasibility of implementing BreatheWell Wear, a mobile smartwatch application with companion smartphone app, as an intervention for stress management in military veterans with mTBI and PTSD. Methods: Thirty veterans with chronic symptoms of mTBI and PTSD recruited from an interdisciplinary, intensive outpatient program participated in this pilot pragmatic clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental (BreatheWell Wear and conventional care) and control (conventional care) groups for 4 weeks. Conventional care included instruction on relaxation breathing and participation in behavioral health therapy. Effects on goal attainment, treatment adherence, diaphragmatic breathing technique knowledge, and stress were measured through surveys and diaries. Changes in symptoms, mood, and well-being were measured pre/postintervention via the Posttraumatic Checklist for DSM-5, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Flourishing Scale. Results: Person-centered goal attainment ( t = 4.009, P &lt; .001), treatment adherence ( t = 2.742, P = .001), diaphragmatic breathing technique knowledge ( t = 1.637, P &lt; .001), and reported ease of remembering to practice ( t = −3.075, P = .005) were significantly greater in the experimental group. As expected, measures of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and psychological well-being showed clinically meaningful change in both groups, and both groups demonstrated reduced stress following diaphragmatic breathing. Conclusion: These preliminary findings indicate that BreatheWell Wear may be a clinically feasible tool for supporting diaphragmatic breathing as an intervention in veterans with mTBI and PTSD, and a future effectiveness trial is warranted.

10.2196/27900,Effectiveness of an internet-based and telephone-assisted training for parents of 4-year-old children with disruptive behavior: Implementation research,"Sourander, Andre;Ristkari, Terja;Kurki, Marjo;Gilbert, Sonja;Hinkka-Yli-Salomäki, Susanna;Kinnunen, Malin;Pulkki-Råback, Laura;McGrath, Patrick J.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2021.3.3,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: There is a lack of effectiveness studies when digital parent training programs are implemented in real-world practice. The efficacy of the internet-based and telephone-assisted Finnish Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) parent training intervention on the disruptive behavior of 4-year-old children was studied in a randomized controlled trial setting in Southwest Finland between 2011 and 2013. After that, the intervention was implemented nationwide in child health clinics from 2015 onwards. Objective: The main aim of this study was to compare the treatment characteristics and effectiveness of the SFSW parent training intervention between the families who received the intervention when it was implemented as a normal practice in child health clinics and the families who received the same intervention during the randomized controlled trial. Methods: The implementation group comprised 600 families who were recruited in the SFSW intervention between January 2015 and May 2017 in real-world implementation. The RCT intervention group comprised 232 families who were recruited between October 2011 and November 2013. The same demographic and child and parent measures were collected from both study groups and were compared using linear mixed-effect models for repeated measurements. The child psychopathology and functioning level were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) version 1.5-5 for preschool children, the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), and a modified version of the Barkley Home Situations Questionnaire. Parenting skills were measured using the 31-item Parenting Scale and the shorter 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The estimated child and parent outcomes were adjusted for CBCL externalizing scores at baseline, maternal education, duration of the behavior problems, and paternal age. The baseline measurements of each outcome were used as covariates. Results: The implementation group was more likely to complete the intervention than the RCT intervention group (514/600, 85.7% vs 176/232, 75.9%, respectively; P &lt; .001). There were no significant differences between the implementation and RCT intervention groups with regard to child measures, including CBCL externalizing score (–0.2, 95% CI –1.3 to 1.6; P = .83), total score (–0.7, 95% CI –3.0 to 4.5; P = .70), internalizing score (–0.3, 95% CI –1.0 to 1.6; P = .64), and ICU total score (–0.4, 95% Cl –1.9 to 1.2; P = .64). No significant difference was detected in the Parenting Scale total score (0.0, 95% Cl –0.1 to 0.1; P = .50), while DASS-21 total score differed nearly significantly (2.5, 95% Cl 0.0-5.1; P = .05), indicating better improvement in the implementation group. Conclusions: The internet-based and telephone-assisted SFSW parent training intervention was effectively implemented in real-world settings. These findings have implications for addressing the unmet needs of children with disruptive behavior problems. Our initiative could also provide a quick socially distanced solution for the considerable mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

10.2196/26814,An adjunctive Internet-based intervention to enhance treatment for depression in adults: Randomized controlled trial,"Pérez, J. Carola;Fernández, Olga;Cáceres, Cristián;Carrasco, Álvaro E.;Moessner, Markus;Bauer, Stephanie;Espinosa-Duque, Daniel;Gloger, Sergio;Krause, Mariane",JMIR Mental Health,,2021.1.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Internet-based interventions promise to enhance the accessibility of mental health care for a greater number of people and in more remote places. Their effectiveness has been shown for the prevention and treatment of various mental disorders. However, their potential when delivered as add-on to conventional treatment (ie, blended care) is less clear. Objective: The aim of this study is to study the effectiveness of an internet intervention (ASCENSO) implemented in addition to face-to-face treatment as usual (TAU) for depression. Methods: A 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in an outpatient private mental health care center in Chile. In all, 167 adults, diagnosed with major depressive disorder, without severe comorbidities, and with internet access, were included. Eighty-four participants were assigned to the intervention group and received medical and psychological TAU from the mental health center plus access to the ASCENSO online platform. The control group (n=83) received only TAU. The ASCENSO platform includes psycho-educational information, depressive symptom monitoring and feedback, and managing emergencies based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. Emergency management was mental health provider–assisted. TAU includes access to primary care physicians and psychiatrists, to a brief individual psychotherapy, and to medication when needed. The baseline questionnaires were administered in person, and 6- and 9-months assessments were conducted online. Depression symptoms and quality of life were measured by self-administered questionnaires, and treatment adherence was determined via the Mental Health Center’s internal records. The usage of ASCENSO was assessed by server logs. Reduction on depressive symptomatology was considered as the primary outcome of the intervention and quality of life as a secondary outcome. Results: Of the 84 participants in the intervention group, 5 participants (6%) never accessed the online platform. Of the remaining 79 participants who accessed ASCENSO, 1 (1%, 1/79) did not answer any of the symptom questionnaire, and most participants (72/79, 91%) answered the monitoring questionnaires irregularly. The ASCENSO intervention implemented in addition to face-to-face care did not improve the outcome of the usual care delivered at the mental health center, either in terms of reduction of depressive symptoms ( F 2,6087 = 0.48; P = .62) or in the improvement of quality of life (EQ-5D-3L: F 2,7678 = 0 .24; P = .79 and EQ-VAS: F 2,6670 = 0.13; P = .88). In contrast, for the primary ( F 2,850 = 78.25; P &lt; .001) and secondary outcomes (EQ-5D-3L: F 2,1067 = 37.87; EQ-VAS: F 2,4390 = 51.69; P &lt; .001) in both groups, there was an improvement from baseline to 6 months (P&lt;.001), but there was no change at 9 months. In addition, no effects on adherence to or use of TAU were found. Finally, the dropout rate for the face-to-face treatment component was 54% (45/84) for the intervention group versus 39% (32/83) for the control group ( P = .07). Conclusions: The fact that the adjunctive access to ASCENSO did not improve outcome could be due to both the rather high effectiveness of TAU and to patients’ limited use of the online platform.

Effects of Be a Mom in psychological processes compared with a control group were examined at post-intervention and at 4-months follow-up. Additionally, this work explored whether changes in psychological processes mediated improvements in positive mental health at postintervention. Methods: In total, 367 postpartum women presenting low risk for postpartum depression were randomly assigned to the intervention group ( n = 191) or to a waiting-list control group ( n = 176). Results: Compared with the control group, the intervention group reported significantly greater baseline to postintervention increases in self-compassion. No significant effects were found at the 4-month follow-up. Multilevel mediation showed that self-compassion improvements significantly mediated improvements in positive mental health among the intervention group. No significant results were found for psychological flexibility or emotion regulation. Conclusions: This study suggests that Be a Mom has the potential to cultivate self-compassion among low-risk postpartum women and that this may be a key mechanism for promoting positive mental health in this context.

10.2196/25933,Voice-based conversational agents for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions: Systematic literature review,"Bérubé, Caterina;Schachner, Theresa;Keller, Roman;Fleisch, Elgar;Wangenheim, Florian V.;Barata, Filipe;Kowatsch, Tobias",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2020.11.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Chronic and mental health conditions are increasingly prevalent worldwide. As devices in our everyday lives offer more and more voice-based self-service, voice-based conversational agents (VCAs) have the potential to support the prevention and management of these conditions in a scalable manner. However, evidence on VCAs dedicated to the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions is unclear. Objective: This study provides a better understanding of the current methods used in the evaluation of health interventions for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions delivered through VCAs. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We included primary research involving the prevention or management of chronic or mental health conditions through a VCA and reporting an empirical evaluation of the system either in terms of system accuracy, technology acceptance, or both. A total of 2 independent reviewers conducted the screening and data extraction, and agreement between them was measured using Cohen kappa. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the selected records. Results: Of 7170 prescreened papers, 12 met the inclusion criteria. All studies were nonexperimental. The VCAs provided behavioral support (n=5), health monitoring services (n=3), or both (n=4). The interventions were delivered via smartphones (n=5), tablets (n=2), or smart speakers (n=3). In 2 cases, no device was specified. A total of 3 VCAs targeted cancer, whereas 2 VCAs targeted diabetes and heart failure. The other VCAs targeted hearing impairment, asthma, Parkinson disease, dementia, autism, intellectual disability, and depression. The majority of the studies (n=7) assessed technology acceptance, but only few studies (n=3) used validated instruments. Half of the studies (n=6) reported either performance measures on speech recognition or on the ability of VCAs to respond to health-related queries. Only a minority of the studies (n=2) reported behavioral measures or a measure of attitudes toward intervention-targeted health behavior. Moreover, only a minority of studies (n=4) reported controlling for participants’ previous experience with technology. Finally, risk bias varied markedly. Conclusions: The heterogeneity in the methods, the limited number of studies identified, and the high risk of bias show that research on VCAs for chronic and mental health conditions is still in its infancy. Although the results of system accuracy and technology acceptance are encouraging, there is still a need to establish more conclusive evidence on the efficacy of VCAs for the prevention and management of chronic and mental health conditions, both in absolute terms and in comparison with standard health care.

This was a cross-sectional questionnaire study of depressed patients at two primary care clinics in a Midwest academic medical center. Patients were eligible if they were 19 years of age or older and had an active or previous diagnosis of depression in their medical record. The patients have expressed an interest in using mobile apps as part of their care, but an important component of the use of apps involves how the utilization of the data they enter into the app will be incorporated into the care they are receiving. If mobile technology interventions are designed in collaboration with patients and care providers, access, engagement and continuity of care can improve [67]. Mobile technology should be embedded within a model of care that has demonstrated treatment effectiveness while simultaneously tailoring the mobile technology to support patient engagement for the behaviors identified in need of improvement. Obtaining patient activation scores prior to implementing mobile technology interventions may provide an opportunity to better understand an individual’s potential success or lack thereof in self-management behaviors. Follow-up measurements of patient activation and health literacy may be able to determine relationships between the technological intervention and self-management behaviors. Furthermore, utilizing consumer technologies can empower patients, extend benefits of traditional clinical services, and enhance patient’s decision-making in the management of their own health.

10.2196/21977,Effectiveness of a mobile health and self-management app for high-risk patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in daily clinical practice: Mixed methods evaluation study,"Kooij, Laura;Vos, Petra J. E.;Dijkstra, Antoon;van Harten, Wim H.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2020.6.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Mobile health and self-management interventions may positively affect behavioral change and reduce hospital admissions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, not all patients qualify for these interventions, and systematic, comprehensive information on implementation- and compliance-related aspects of mobile self-management apps is lacking. Due to the tendency to target digital services to patients in stable phases of disease, it is especially relevant to focus on the use of these services in broad clinical practice for patients recently discharged from hospital. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effects of a mobile health and self-management app in clinical practice for recently discharged patients with COPD on use of the app, self-management, expectations, and experiences (technology acceptance); patients’ and nurses’ satisfaction; and hospital readmissions. Methods: A prototype of the app was pilot tested with 6 patients with COPD. The COPD app consisted of an 8-week program including the Lung Attack Action Plan, education, medication overview, video consultation, and questionnaires (monitored by nurses). In the feasibility study, adult patients with physician-diagnosed COPD, access to a mobile device, and proficiency of the Dutch language were included from a large teaching hospital during hospital admission. Self-management (Partners in Health Scale), technology acceptance (Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology model), and satisfaction were assessed using questionnaires at baseline, after 8 weeks, and 20 weeks. Use was assessed with log data, and readmission rates were extracted from the electronic medical record. Results: A total of 39 patients were included; 76.4% (133/174) of patients had to be excluded from participation, and 48.9% of those patients (65/133) were excluded because of lack of digital skills, access to a mobile device, or access to the internet. The COPD app was opened most often in the first week (median 6.0; IQR 3.5-10.0), but its use decreased over time. The self-management element knowledge and coping increased significantly over time ( P = .04). The COPD app was rated on a scale of 1-10, with an average score by patients of 7.7 (SD 1.7) and by nurses of 6.3 (SD 1.2). Preliminary evidence about the readmission rate showed that 13% (5/39) of patients were readmitted within 30 days; 31% (12/39) of patients were readmitted within 20 weeks, compared with 14.1% (48/340) and 21.8% (74/340) in a preresearch cohort, respectively. Conclusions: The use of a mobile self-management app after hospital discharge seems to be feasible only for a small number of patients with COPD. Patients were satisfied with the service; however, use decreased over time, and only knowledge and coping changed significantly over time. Therefore, future research on digital self-management interventions in clinical practice should focus on including more difficult subgroups of target populations, a multidisciplinary approach, technology-related aspects (such as acceptability), and fine-tuning its adoption in clinical pathways.

10.2196/25087,Adverse childhood experiences and building resilience with the JoyPop app: Evaluation study,"MacIsaac, Angela;Mushquash, Aislin R.;Mohammed, Shakira;Grassia, Elizabeth;Smith, Savanah;Wekerle, Christine",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2020.10.17,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on mental health, self-regulatory capacities, and overall resilience are well-known. Given such effects, ACEs may play a role in how individuals adjust to challenges later in life. Of interest in this study is the transition to university, a time of heightened stress when adapting to circumstances is required and when those with ACEs may need additional in-the-moment support to exercise resilience. A smartphone app may provide a worthwhile and readily accessible medium for a resilience intervention, provided behavioral outcomes are adequately evaluated. Objective: This study evaluates the impact of an innovative, smartphone app–based resilience intervention. The JoyPop app was designed to promote resilience through the use of self-regulatory skills such as emotion regulation and executive functioning. Among a sample of first-year undergraduate students, we explored whether use of the app would be associated with positive changes in resilience and related outcomes, and whether these benefits were influenced by level of childhood adversity. Methods: Participants (N=156) were requested to use the JoyPop app for 4 weeks, at least twice daily. Changes in resilience, emotion regulation, executive functioning, and depression were assessed after 2 and 4 weeks of app usage using multilevel modeling. Results: The sample of 156 participants included 123 females and 33 males, with a mean age of 19.02 years (SD 2.90). On average participants used the app on 20.43 of the possible 28 days (SD 7.14). App usage was associated with improvements in emotion regulation (χ²₁=44.46; P&lt;.001), such that it improved by 0.25 points on the 18-point scale for each additional day of app usage, and symptoms of depression (χ²₁=25.12; P&lt;.001), such that depression symptoms were reduced by .08 points on the 9-point scale with each additional day of app usage. An interaction between ACEs and days of app usage existed for emotion regulation, such that participants with more adversity evidenced a faster rate of change in emotion regulation (P=.02). Conclusions: Results highlight that daily incorporation of an app-based resilience intervention can help youth who have experienced adversity to improve emotion regulation skills and experience reductions in depression. The JoyPop app represents an important step forward in the integration of resilience intervention research with a technology-based medium that provides in-the-moment support.

10.3233/JAD-210010,Virtual reality experience intervention may reduce responsive behaviors in nursing home residents with dementia: A case series,"Sultana, Munira;Campbell, Karen;Jennings, Morgan;Montero-Odasso, Manuel;Orange, J. B.;Knowlton, Jill;George, Armin St.;Bryant, Dianne",Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: People with advanced dementia often exhibit responsive behaviors such as apathy, depression, agitation, aggression, and psychosis. Non-pharmacological approaches (e.g., listening to music, watching television, doing arts and crafts) are now considered as a first-line strategy to manage responsive behaviors in clinical practice due to the potential risks associated with the antipsychotic medications. To date, no evaluations of immersive non-head mounted virtual reality (VR) experience as a non-pharmacologic approach for people with advanced dementia living in nursing homes have been reported. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility (acceptance and safety) of VR experience. Methods: A single site case series (nonrandomized and unblinded) with a convenience sample (N = 24; age = 85.8±8.6 years; Cognitive Performance Scale score = 3.4±0.6) measuring depression and agitation before and after the intervention. The intervention was a 30-min long research coordinator- facilitated VR experience for two weeks (10 sessions). Results: The intervention was feasible (attrition rate = 0%; adverse events = 0). A reduction in depression and in agitation was observed after the intervention. However, we suggest extreme caution in interpreting this result considering the study design and small sample size. Conclusion: This study provides the basis for conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of VR experience on responsive behaviors in nursing homes. Since our intervention uses a smart remote-controlled projector without a headset, infectious exposure can be avoided following the COVID-19 pandemic-induced physical distancing policy in care homes.

10.1017/S0033291719002861,Impaired emotional and behavioural awareness and control in patients with dissociative seizures,"Jungilligens, Johannes;Wellmer, Jörg;Schlegel, Uwe;Kessler, Henrik;Axmacher, Nikolai;Popkirov, Stoyan",Psychological Medicine,,2019.4.5,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Dissociative seizures (DS) are brief episodes of disrupted awareness and behavioural control that may resemble epileptic seizures. They are thought to arise in the context of impaired emotion processing and disinhibition. In a multi-perspective neuropsychological study, we aim to assess specific metacognitive traits and behavioural features involved in the affective and cognitive underpinnings of DS (emotion recognition and regulation, inhibition, interoception and sense of agency). Methods: Twenty prospectively recruited patients with video-EEG-confirmed DS and 20 healthy controls underwent comprehensive neuropsychological and psychiatric testing using validated questionnaires and structured interviews. Behavioural experimental data was obtained using a custom-made emotional go/no-go task, a digital Libet clock setup and a heartbeat counting paradigm. Results: Emotion recognition, as quantified in the emotional go/no-go task, was impaired in the DS group, and correlated with alexithymic traits. Behavioural inhibition, especially under conditions that would require emotion regulation, was also reduced in the emotional go/no-go task compared to controls and was correlated with neuropsychometric measures of emotion regulation. Data from the Libet clock experiment suggested impaired behavioural awareness in DS patients. No evidence of impaired interoceptive awareness was found in the heartbeat counting task. Conclusion: These results represent comprehensive experimental evidence for alterations in emotional and behavioural awareness and control in patients with DS that yield empirical evidence for current psychopathological models. Our findings offer a more detailed understanding of key pathogenic factors in DS and provide theoretical support for recently developed cognitive-behavioural therapies for DS.

The aim of this study was to explore system use, usefulness, ease of use, and preliminary effects of Stress Proffen, an app-based cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention for patients with cancer. A feasibility pilot project tested the intervention with cancer survivors ( N = 25). The intervention contained (a) one face-to-face introduction session, (b) 10 app-based modules with stress management educational material and exercises, and (c) one follow-up phone call. Post-intervention interviews were conducted and user log-data were extracted. Outcome measures—Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Anxiety and Depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL; SF-36), and Self-Regulatory Fatigue (SRF-18)—were completed at baseline and post-intervention. Participants were primarily women (84%), age 34–71 (mean 48) and represented a variety of cancer diagnoses (majority breast cancer: 40%). Twenty-two participants completed all (pre–post) questionnaires. Sixteen participants (67%) completed at least 7 of 10 modules within the 8-week study period. Post-intervention interviews described StressProffen as providing a new, appreciated, and easily accessible stress management tool for the cancer survivors. Dependent/paired t-tests showed significant pre–post intervention effects with significant decrease in stress ( p = .008), anxiety ( p = .019), and self-regulatory fatigue ( p = .025), and improved HRQoL (Role Physical, General Health, Vitality, and Role Emotional, all p ’s &lt;.01). App-based stress management interventions such as StressProffen can provide appreciated support for cancer survivors, should be easy to use, can provide significant stress reduction, and improve emotional well-being. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial is warranted and is in progress. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0293961. An app-based stress-management program for patients with cancer was found to be easy to use and could provide significant stress reduction and improved emotional well-being.

10.2196/16211,The effects of a digital well-being intervention on patients with chronic conditions: Observational study,"Parks, Acacia C.;Williams, Allison L.;Kackloudis, Gina M.;Stafford, Julia L.;Boucher, Eliane M.;Honomichl, Ryan D.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2019.9.10,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Chronic conditions account for 75% of health care costs, and the impact of chronic illness is expected to grow over time. Although subjective well-being predicts better health outcomes, people with chronic conditions tend to report lower well-being. Improving well-being might mitigate costs associated with chronic illness; however, existing interventions can be difficult to access and draw from a single theoretical approach. Happify, a digital well-being intervention program drawing from multiple theoretical traditions to target well-being, has already been established as an efficacious means of improving well-being in both distressed and nondistressed users. Objective: This study aimed to compare change in well-being over time after using Happify for users with and without a chronic condition. Methods: Data were obtained from Happify users, a publicly available digital well-being program accessible via website or mobile phone app. Users work on tracks addressing a specific issue (eg, conquering negative thoughts) composed of games and activities based on positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness principles. The sample included 821 users receiving at least 6 weeks’ exposure to Happify (ranging from 42 to 179 days) who met other inclusion criteria. As part of a baseline questionnaire, respondents reported demographic information (age and gender) and whether they had any of the prespecified chronic conditions: arthritis, diabetes, insomnia, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, psoriasis, eczema, or some other condition (450 reported a chronic condition, whereas 371 did not). Subjective well-being was assessed with the Happify Scale, a 9-item measure of positive emotionality and life satisfaction. To evaluate changes in well-being over time, a mixed effects linear regression model was fit for subjective well-being, controlling for demographics and platform usage. Results: At baseline, users with a chronic condition had significantly lower subjective well-being (mean 38.34, SD 17.40) than users without a chronic condition (mean 43.65, SD 19.13). However, change trajectories for users with or without a chronic condition were not significantly different; both groups experienced equivalent improvements in well-being. We also found an effect for time from baseline ( b = 0.071; SE = 0.010; P &lt; .01) and number of activities completed ( b = 0.03; SE = 0.009; P &lt; .01), and a 2-way interaction between number of activities completed and time from baseline ( b = 0.0002; SE = 0.00006; P &lt; .01), such that completing more activities and doing so over increasingly longer periods produced improved well-being scores. Conclusions: Data from this study support the conclusion that users with a chronic condition experienced significant improvement over time. Despite reporting lower subjective well-being on the whole, their change trajectory while using Happify was equivalent to those without a chronic condition. Consistent with past research, users who completed more activities over a longer period showed the most improvement. In short, the presence of a chronic condition did not prevent users from showing improved well-being when using Happify.

10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00191,Impact of mobile health interventions during the perinatal period on maternal psychosocial outcomes: A systematic review,"Dol, Justine;Richardson, Brianna;Murphy, Gail Tomblin;Aston, Megan;McMillan, Douglas;Campbell-Yeo, Marsha",JBI Evidence Synthesis,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of mother-targeted mobile health (mHealth) education interventions during the perinatal period on maternal psychosocial outcomes in high-income countries. Introduction: The perinatal period is an exciting yet challenging period for mothers that requires physical, emotional and social adjustment to new norms and expectations. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of mHealth by new mothers who are seeking health information through online or mobile applications. While there have been systematic reviews on the impact of mHealth interventions on maternal and newborn health in low- and middle-income countries, the impact of these interventions on maternal psychosocial health outcomes in high-income countries remains uncertain. Inclusion criteria: This review considered studies of mHealth education interventions targeting mothers in high-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) during the perinatal period. Interventions must have started between the antenatal period (conception through birth) through six weeks postpartum. All experimental study designs were included. Outcomes included self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase were searched for published studies in English on December 16, 2018. Gray literature was also searched for non-peer reviewed articles, including Google Scholar, mHealth intelligence and clinical trials databases. Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal instruments from JBI. Quantitative data were extracted from included studies independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI. All conflicts were solved through consensus with a third reviewer. Quantitative data were, where possible, pooled in statistical meta-analysis using RevMan. Where statistical pooling was not possible, findings were reported narratively. Results: Of the 1,607 unique articles identified, 106 full-text papers were screened and 24 articles were critically appraised, with 21 included in the final review. Eleven were quasi-experimental and 10 were randomized controlled trials. The mHealth intervention approach varied, with text message and mobile applications being the most common. Length of intervention ranged from four weeks to six months. The topics of the mHealth intervention varied widely, with the most common topic being postpartum depression. Mothers who received an mHealth intervention targeting postpartum depression showed a decreased score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale when measured post-intervention (odds ratio = –6.01, 95% confidence interval = –8.34 to –3.67, p &lt; 0.00001). The outcomes related to self-efficacy, social support and anxiety showed mixed findings of effectiveness (beneficial and no change) across the studies identified. Conclusions: This review provides insight into the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting mothers in high-income countries in the perinatal period to enhance four psychosocial outcomes: self-efficacy, social support, anxiety and depression. Despite a wide variety of outcome measurements used, the predominant findings suggest that there are insufficient data to conclude that mHealth interventions can improve self-efficacy and anxiety outcomes. Potential benefits on social support were related to interventions targeting postnatal behaviors. Postpartum depression was the mostly commonly reported outcome. Findings related to the comparison of pre-post outcomes and intervention versus control demonstrated that mHealth interventions targeting postpartum depression were associated with a reduction in postpartum depression.

10.2196/12775,Exploring the relationship between usage and outcomes of an Internet-based intervention for individuals with depressive symptoms: Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial,"Enrique, Angel;Palacios, Jorge E.;Ryan, Holly;Richards, Derek",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2018.11.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Internet interventions can easily generate objective data about program usage. Increasingly, more studies explore the relationship between usage and outcomes, but they often report different metrics of use, and the findings are mixed. Thus, current evaluations fail to demonstrate which metrics should be considered and how these metrics are related to clinically meaningful change. Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationship between several usage metrics and outcomes of an internet-based intervention for depression. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial that examined the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depression (Space from Depression) in an adult community sample. All participants who enrolled in the intervention, regardless of meeting the inclusion criteria, were included in this study. Space from Depression is a 7-module supported intervention, delivered over a period of 8 weeks. Different usage metrics (ie, time spent, modules and activities completed, and percentage of program completion) were automatically collected by the platform, and composite variables from these (eg, activities per session) were computed. A breakdown of the usage metrics was obtained by weeks. For the analysis, the sample was divided into those who obtained a reliable change (RC)—and those who did not. Results: Data from 216 users who completed pre- and posttreatment outcomes were included in the analyses. A total of 89 participants obtained an RC, and 127 participants did not obtain an RC. Those in the RC group significantly spent more time, had more log-ins, used more tools, viewed a higher percentage of the program, and got more reviews from their supporter compared with those who did not obtain an RC. Differences between groups in usage were observed from the first week in advance across the different metrics, although they vanished over time. In the RC group, the usage was higher during the first 4 weeks, and then a significant decrease was observed. Our results showed that specific levels of platform usage, 7 hours total time spent, 15 sessions, 30 tools used, and 50% of program completion, were associated with RC. Conclusions: Overall, the results showed that those individuals who obtained an RC after the intervention had higher levels of exposure to the platform. The usage during the first half of the intervention was higher, and differences between groups were observed from the first week. This study also showed specific usage levels associated with outcomes that could be tested in controlled studies to inform the minimal usage to establish adherence. These results will help to better understand how to use internet-based interventions and what optimal level of engagement can most affect outcomes.

10.1089/tmj.2017.0117,"A systematic review of electronic mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions for weight, weight-related behaviors, and psychological stress","Lyzwinski, Lynnette Nathalie;Caffery, Liam;Bambling, Matthew;Edirippulige, Sisira",Telemedicine and e-Health,,2017.5.2,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: Recent research indicates that mindfulness-based interventions are effective for stress, maladaptive weight-related behaviors, and weight loss. Little is presently known about their applicability and effectiveness when delivered electronically, including through Web-based and mobile device media. The primary aims of this review were to identify what types of electronic mindfulness-based interventions have been undertaken for stress, maladaptive weight-related behaviors, and weight loss, and to assess their overall effectiveness. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases was undertaken in June 2016. Results: A total of 21 studies were identified that met inclusion criteria and were selected in the final review. Of these, 19 were mindfulness-based interventions for stress reduction. Two were Web-based mindful eating/intuitive eating interventions for weight. Only one electronic mindfulness-based study was identified that targeted both stress and maladaptive weight-related behaviors. Most electronic interventions were effective for stress reduction N = 14/19 (74%). There were insufficient electronic mindfulness-based interventions for weight to determine if they were effective or not. Additionally, no mobile mindfulness-based intervention was identified for weight or weight-related behaviors. Conclusion: Electronic mindfulness-based interventions through diverse media appear to be effective for stress reduction. More studies are needed that target weight and weight-related behaviors as well as studies that target both stress and weight. More randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess mobile mindfulness-based apps are needed as we only identified four app trials for stress. Mobile mindfulness-based interventions for weight and weight-related behaviors are a future area of research novelty.

Yet, changing self-regulatory behaviors is fundamental to the self-management of complex lifestyle-related chronic conditions such as depression and obesity - two top contributors to the global burden of disease and disability. To optimize treatments and address these burdens, behavior change and self-regulation must be better understood in relation to their neurobiological underpinnings. Here, we present the conceptual framework and protocol for a novel study, “Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes (ENGAGE)”. The ENGAGE study integrates neuroscience with behavioral science to better understand the self-regulation related mechanisms of behavior change for improving mood and weight outcomes among adults with comorbid depression and obesity. We collect assays of three self-regulation targets (emotion, cognition, and self-reflection) in multiple settings: neuroimaging and behavioral lab-based measures, virtual reality, and passive smartphone sampling. By connecting human neuroscience and behavioral science in this manner within the ENGAGE study, we develop a prototype for elucidating the underlying self-regulation mechanisms of behavior change outcomes and their application in optimizing intervention strategies for multiple chronic diseases.

10.1016/j.psym.2017.09.003,Collaborative care and related interventions in patients with heart disease: An update and new directions,"Huffman, Jeff C.;Adams, Caitlin N.;Celano, Christopher M.",Psychosomatics: Journal of Consultation and Liaison Psychiatry,,2017.8.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, are very common in cardiac patients and are independently linked to adverse cardiac outcomes, including mortality. Collaborative care and other integrated care models have been used successfully to manage psychiatric conditions in patients with heart disease, with beneficial effects on function and other outcomes. Novel programs using remote delivery of mental health interventions and promotion of psychological well-being may play an increasingly large role in supporting cardiovascular health. Methods: We review prior studies of standard and expanded integrated care programs among patients with cardiac disease, examine contemporary intervention delivery methods (e.g., Internet or mobile phone) that could be adapted for these programs, and outline mental health-related interventions to promote healthy behaviors and overall recovery across all cardiac patients. Results: Standard integrated care models for mental health disorders are effective at improving mood, anxiety, and function in patients with heart disease. Novel, “blended” collaborative care models may have even greater promise in improving cardiac outcomes, and interfacing with cardiac patients via mobile applications, text messages, and video visits may provide additional benefit. A variety of newer interventions using stress management, mindfulness, or positive psychology have shown promising effects on mental health, health behaviors, and overall cardiac outcomes. Conclusions: Further study of novel applications of collaborative care and related interventions is warranted given the potential of these programs to increase the reach and effect of mental health interventions in patients with heart disease.

Objective: To determine whether an Internet-assisted intervention using whole-population screening that targets the most symptomatic 4-year-old children is effective at 6 and 12 months after the start of treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-parallel-group randomized clinical trial was performed from October 1, 2011, through November 30, 2013, at a primary health care clinic in Southwest Finland. Data analysis was performed from August 6, 2015, to December 11, 2015. Of a screened population of 4656 children, 730 met the screening criteria indicating a high level of disruptive behavioral problems. A total of 464 parents of 4-year-old children were randomized into the Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) intervention group (n = 232) or an education control (EC) group (n = 232). Interventions: The SFSW intervention, an 11-session Internet-assisted parent training program that included weekly telephone coaching. Main Outcomes and Measures: Child Behavior Checklist version for preschool children (CBCL/1.5-5) externalizing scale (primary outcome), other CBCL/1.5-5 scales and subscores, Parenting Scale, Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits, and the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. All data were analyzed by intention to treat and per protocol. The assessments were made before randomization and 6 and 12 months after randomization. Results: Of the children randomized, 287 (61.9%) were male and 79 (17.1%) lived in other than a family with 2 biological parents. At 12-month follow-up, improvement in the SFSW intervention group was significantly greater compared with the control group on the following measures: CBCL/1.5-5 externalizing scale (effect size, 0.34; P &lt; .001), internalizing scale (effect size, 0.35; P &lt; .001), and total scores (effect size, 0.37; P &lt; .001); 5 of 7 syndrome scales, including aggression (effect size, 0.36; P &lt; .001), sleep (effect size, 0.24; P = .002), withdrawal (effect size, 0.25; P = .005), anxiety (effect size, 0.26; P = .003), and emotional problems (effect size, 0.31; P = .001); Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits callousness scores (effect size, 0.19; P = .03); and self-reported parenting skills (effect size, 0.53; P &lt; .001). Conclusions and Relevance: The study reveals the effectiveness and feasibility of an Internet-assisted parent training intervention offered for parents of preschool children with disruptive behavioral problems screened from the whole population. The strategy of population-based screening of children at an early age to offering parent training using digital technology and telephone coaching is a promising public health strategy for providing early intervention for a variety of child mental health problems.

Since the adoption of these technologies for behavioral monitoring and intervention is not trivial in clinical practice, the main objective of this review is to provide an overview and to discuss the several initiatives published so far in the literature related to the Internet-based technologies aimed to deliver evidence-based psychological interventions for bipolar disorder patients. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the literature from multiple technological, psychiatric and psychological domains. The search was conducted by applying the Boolean algorithm ""BIPOLAR AND DISORDER AND (treatment OR intervention) AND (online OR Internet OR web-based OR smartphone OR mobile)"" at MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials, ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar. Results: We identified over 251 potential entries matching the search criteria and after a thorough manual review, 29 publications pertaining to 12 different projects, specifically focusing on psychological interventions for bipolar patients through diverse Internet-based methods, were selected. Limitations: Taking into consideration the diversity of the initiatives and the inconclusive main outcome results of the studies, there is still limited evidence available to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of interventions using Internet-based technologies for bipolar disorder. Conclusions: However, considering the high rates of retention and compliance reported, they represent a potential highly feasible and acceptable method of delivering this kind of interventions to bipolar patients.

Self-help interventions may have a role in augmenting treatment and this work aimed to systematically review the evidence for computerised anxiety and depression interventions in CYP aged 5–25 years old. Databases were searched for randomised controlled trials and 27 studies were identified. For young people (12–25 years) with risk of diagnosed anxiety disorders or depression, computerised CBT (cCBT) had positive effects for symptoms of anxiety (SMD −0.77, 95% CI −1.45 to −0.09, k = 6, N = 220) and depression (SMD −0.62, 95% CI −1.13 to −0.11, k = 7, N = 279). In a general population study of young people, there were small positive effects for anxiety (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.03; N = 1273) and depression (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.03; N = 1280). There was uncertainty around the effectiveness of cCBT in children (5–11 years). Evidence for other computerised interventions was sparse and inconclusive. Computerised CBT has potential for treating and preventing anxiety and depression in clinical and general populations of young people. Further program development and research is required to extend its use and establish its benefit in children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Given that MSM have been documented as early adopters of emerging technology, we examined communication technology access and utilization, and mobile health (mHealth) acceptance among Peruvian MSM and transgender women (TGW) in order to gauge opportunities for mHealth-enabled HIV interventions. A convenience sample of 359 HIV-infected MSM and TGW recruited from three sites in Lima, Peru completed standardized assessments of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), risky sexual behavior, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence along with self-constructed measures of communication technology access and utilization, and mHealth acceptance. Most participants (86%) had daily access to any cell phone, including smartphones (30%). The most frequent communication activities were receiving and making calls, and receiving and sending text messages using cell phones. On a 5-point Likert scale, participants expressed interest in using mHealth for medication reminders ( M = 3.21, SD = 1.32) and engaging in anonymous online interactions with health professionals to discuss HIV-related issues ( M = 3.56, SD = 1.33). Importantly, no significant differences were found in communication technology use and mHealth acceptance among participants with AUDs, depression, and suboptimal ART adherence, all of which are associated with poor HIV treatment outcomes. Findings show support for implementing mHealth-based intervention strategies using cell phones to assess and reduce HIV-risk behaviors among HIV-infected MSM and TGW.

Many women engage in health risk behaviors during pregnancy. Multiple health behavior change (MHBC) interventions provide support to change health behaviors, but further information is needed on potential targets for such an intervention, as well as on the feasibility of technology use and e-health with this population. Materials and Methods: Two studies were completed as part of this project. First, a survey to examine views regarding health behaviors, desires to change health behaviors, and use of technology was completed by 68 pregnant women presenting for routine care. Based on survey findings, a brief MHBC e-health educational intervention related to breastfeeding, healthy nutrition/lifestyle, and stress management, using iPad® (Apple, Cupertino, CA) and text-messaging media, was then developed and piloted in the home with five pregnant women. Results: In the survey, the majority of participants reported interest in receiving help to improve health behaviors, including losing weight or eating a healthier diet, breastfeeding, smoking cessation, and help with depression. The majority of women reported access to a computer with Internet, a phone, and frequent use of text messaging. In the second phase, results suggest that the home-based intervention was feasible and that the technology was convenient and user-friendly. Conclusions: Pregnant women are interested in improving health behaviors and found a brief technology-based e-health intervention feasible, convenient, and user-friendly. In-home technology appears to be a feasible and convenient approach to addressing the multiple health behavior change needs of pregnant women.

Although three quarters of young men who have sex with men (YMSM) Grindr users report having sex with a Grindr-met partner, the correlates of risky sexual behavior with Grindr-met partners are unknown. A randomly selected sample of 18- to 24-year-old, Grindr-using YMSM completed an anonymous online questionnaire assessing patterns of Grindr use and sexual behavior with their last Grindr-met partners. Of the 146 YMSM who reported having sex with Grindr-met partners, 20% had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) at last sex with their Grindr-met partner. In the multivariable model, YMSM who used Grindr for at least one year showed naked chest/abs in their profile photo, and reported more past month Grindr-met partners were more likely to report UAI. These findings suggest that familiarity with the app was associated with YMSM's UAI with Grindr-met partners. Moreover, sexualized profile photos (i.e., naked chest/abs) may be associated with sexual risk-taking behaviors. HIV prevention interventions delivered or linked through such apps should target individuals who are longer/frequent users and who present sexualized profiles.

We designed a tailored, theory-based interactive HIV/STI prevention website for young BMSM, called HealthMpowerment.org (HMP) and conducted a small pilot trial comparing HMP to currently available HIV/STI websites. We present findings demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention to the target population of young BMSM. Retention rates were 90% and 78% at one- and three-month follow-ups, respectively. Evaluation immediately after the intervention’s completion revealed that participants who used the HMP website reported high levels of user satisfaction and interest and low levels of website difficulty and frustration. At the end of the intervention, there was a trend in increased behavioral intentions to use condoms and engage in preparatory condom use behaviors in the intervention group compared to the control group ( p = 0.10). We observed a reduction in mean scores on the CES-D scale among those in the intervention group that was not seen in the control group at the one-month follow-up, though this was not statistically significant. Feedback from exit interviews with study participants suggested that HMP is relevant to the prevention needs of young BMSM. Overall, the findings support the acceptability and feasibility of delivering this prevention program to a group that has few interventions despite bearing a significant burden of the epidemic. Future trials, combining Internet and mobile phone technologies, are planned to test HMP among larger and more diverse populations of young BMSM.

Although numerically a dense network of in- and outpatient psychiatric health services exists, the availability in rural and remote regions is insufficient. In rural regions, telemedical concepts can be a chance to unburden and complement the existing healthcare system. Telemedical concepts consisting of video or telephone consulting show first positive results, but there are only a few studies with a randomized controlled design. To improve the treatment of patients with mental disorders in rural regions, we developed a telemedical care concept based on telephone contacts and text-messages. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the telemedical interventions on psychopathological outcomes, e.g. anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatisation. Secondary objective of the study is the analysis of intervention effects on the frequency of medical contacts with healthcare services. Furthermore, the frequency of patients’ crises and the frequency and kind of interventions, initiated by the project nurses will be evaluated. We will also evaluate the acceptance of the telemedical care concept by the patients. Methods/Design: In this paper we describe a three-armed, randomized, controlled study. All participants are recruited from psychiatric day hospitals. The inclusion criteria are a specialist-diagnosed depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder or a somatoform disorder and eligibility to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria are ongoing outpatient psychotherapy, planned interval treatment at the day clinic and expected recurrent suicidality and self-injuring behaviour. The interventions consist of regular patient-individual telephone consultations or telephone consultations with complementing text-messages on the patients’ mobile phone. The interventions will be conducted during a time period of 6 months. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Participants received access to the coached digital CBT‐based intervention, which included individualized guidance and twice‐weekly SMS feedback from a program coach over three months. Results Almost all participants (93.3%, n = 28) accessed the program after enrollment, completing about half (M = 4.15, SD = 2.68) of the 8 sessions and sending an average of 32.5 (SD = 35.2) texts to their coach over three months. From pre‐ to post‐intervention, there were large improvements in eating disorder psychopathology (d = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001) and moderate decreases in binge eating (d = 0.62, p = 0.003) and self‐induced vomiting episodes (d = 0.43, p = 0.031).

In addition, there is substantial variability in the literature regarding what factors predict treatment responding in self‐guided digital treatment for OCD. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that adults with OCD may show early treatment responding (i.e., significant symptom reductions within the first month of treatment) and that this early response could be associated with better post‐treatment outcomes. Methods In a secondary analysis (n = 123), the current study examined the timing and magnitude of symptom change during self‐guided digital CBT, the incidence of early response (at 4‐weeks), and whether early treatment response predicted post‐treatment response (at 8‐weeks). These analyses were conducted for OCD symptoms (primary) and depression symptoms (secondary). Results Results indicated a gradual reduction in OCD and depression symptoms across treatment. Although fewer participants experienced an early response in OCD symptoms (22%) compared to depression symptoms (45%), early response was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of post‐treatment response in both symptom domains. Conclusions These findings highlight that individuals with OCD symptoms may experience reductions in different symptom types at different points during treatment and that early response may be a prognostic factor for overall treatment response in this population across outcomes.

The purpose of this manuscript is to (a) examine the effectiveness of a brief therapy for depression for elder abuse victims, and (b) to compare remote intervention delivery via phone or video to the traditional in-person delivery. Method: PROTECT, Providing Options to Elderly Clients Together , is a brief therapy developed in collaboration with partners at the Department for the Aging (DFTA) of New York City. During the COVID-19 outbreak, PROTECT delivery shifted from in-person to phone or video delivery. Depression severity was tracked using the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9). Reduction in depression severity was evaluated using a linear mixed effects model with non-inferiority test to compare the effectiveness of video vs in-person delivery of PROTECT. Results: PROTECT reduced depression (average 5.15 PHQ-9 points). Video and phone delivery were non-inferior to in-person delivery. The video group completed therapy more quickly than the in-person group and had a more rapid improvement in depression symptoms. Conclusions: PROTECT therapy delivered remotely reduces depression among diverse elder abuse victims. Video delivery of PROTECT could increase reach and scalability to serve more vulnerable older depressed victims.

This information might be important to enhance engagement and self‐efficacy, stop negative feedback loops, and prevent avoidant or destructive behavior during crises. Technology‐based psychotherapeutic exercises are of particular interest because they are accessible and scalable. Methods: This parallel, double‐blind, randomized trial ( N = 1092) compared 12 psychotherapeutic exercises of the Mind Ease app against a reading control and a measurement‐only control. Efficacy was measured with a custom scale validated against the state subscale of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: Each of the 12 exercises significantly reduced anxiety more than controls ( p = 0.018 to &lt;0.001, η² p = 0.06 to 0.37, d = 0.5 to 1.5, d [95% CI] for all exercises together vs. reading control = 0.8 [0.6; 1.0], and vs. measurement‐only control = 0.8 [0.6; 1.0]). Exercises employing cognitive restructuring had effect sizes d [95% CI] of 0.5 [0.2; 0.8], 0.7 [0.3; 1.0], and 0.9 [0.6; 1.2], diaphragmatic breathing of 0.6 [0.3; 0.9], gratitude practice of 0.8 [0.5; 1.1], positive expressive writing of 1.1 [0.7; 1.4], progressive muscle relaxation of 1.3 [0.9; 1.6], guided imagery of 1.3 [1.0; 1.6], and mindfulness of 0.9 [0.6; 1.2], 1.0 [0.7; 1.3], 1.2 [0.9; 1.5], and 1.5 [1.2; 1.9]. Twenty‐eight comparisons between exercises (42%) had p &lt; 0.05, nine met the Bonferroni‐adjusted threshold of p &lt; 0.0008. Conclusions: The 12 psychotherapeutic exercises proved effective at immediately mitigating anxiety. Differences between exercises were substantial even within categories. Mindfulness tended to have a larger effect than cognitive restructuring. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1007/s00787-024-02404-y,Internet- and mobile-based anxiety and depression interventions for children and adolescents: Efficacy and negative effects - A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Dülsen, Patrick;Baumeister, Harald",European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,,2023.7.11,Scholarly Journals,English,"Mental disorders, most commonly anxiety disorders and fourth most common depression, are prevalent in children and adolescents. Internet- and mobile-based interventions might represent a scalable approach to improve mental health care, however, evidence so far is inconclusive and systematic reports on negative effects are missing. Four data-bases were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) targeting anxiety disorders or depression in children and adolescents up to 18 years exhibiting clinically relevant symptoms. Meta-analytic evaluations were conducted in comparison to active and passive control groups, furthermore, pre-defined sub-groups were explored and reported negative effects examined. Pooled estimates showed a moderate positive effect for IMIs targeting anxiety disorders compared to passive control groups (g = -0.69; CI -0.94 to -0.45; k = 8; n = 559; p ≤ 0,001), but not for depression. Pooled estimates compared to active control groups remained non-significant. Subgroup analyses were largely omitted due to an insufficient number of trials or were non-significant. Negative effects were mainly reported as drop-out rates and (non)-response rates, while additional negative effects, such as deterioration rates or the development of additional symptoms, were reported by only one third of included studies. The focus on children and adolescents with clinically relevant symptoms allowed the present findings to complement previous work, however, the limited amount of trials hindered many planned comparisons. The overview of reported negative effects highlighted that negative effects are being neglected in the majority of RCTs. Hence, in the future RCTs should include more information about potential negative effects, at best a combination of quantitative and qualitative information.

10.1037/ccp0000920,Safety behavior reduction for appearance concerns: A randomized controlled trial of a smartphone-based intervention,"Patel, Tapan A.;Cougle, Jesse R.",Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,,2024.5.6,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Appearance concerns are a core feature of multiple psychiatric disorders (i.e., body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorders, and social anxiety disorders). Individuals with these concerns commonly engage in appearance-related safety behaviors (ARSB), behaviors intended to avoid, prevent, or manage the negative evaluation of one’s physical appearance. The present study evaluated a brief ARSB reduction intervention for appearance concerns. Method: Women with elevated appearance concerns ( N = 203) were recruited from across the United States and randomized to receive one of two 1-month smartphone-based interventions targeting ARSBs or unhealthy behaviors (UHBs). Both consisted of daily text messages with links to behavior checklists and reminders to avoid the respective behaviors. Results: Participants in both treatments saw substantial reductions in symptoms. Though the UHB fading condition showed significantly better treatment adherence than ARSB fading, ARSB fading led to significantly lower appearance concerns ( sr ² = .028, p = .014) and eating disorder symptoms ( sr ² = .024, p = .020) at posttreatment, and lower appearance concerns ( sr ² = .041, p = .004), eating disorder symptoms ( sr ² = .029, p = .006), social anxiety ( sr ² = .048, p = .005), and appearance importance at 1-month follow-up ( sr ² = .042, p = .011), relative to UHB fading. Changes in ARSBs were found to partially mediate the effect of treatment on appearance concerns. Conclusions: These preliminary findings provide novel evidence for the efficacy of targeting ARSBs and suggest that this text-based intervention may be an efficacious and accessible intervention for women with elevated appearance concerns.

Objective: To determine whether a multifaceted intervention involving a digital health care model along with a community-based antistigma campaign leads to reduced depression risk and lower mental health-related stigma among adults residing in rural India. Design, setting, and participants: This parallel, cluster randomized, usual care-controlled trial was conducted from September 2020 to December 2021 with blinded follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months at 44 rural primary health centers across 3 districts in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh states in India. Adults aged 18 years and older at high risk of depression or self-harm defined by either a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) score of 10 or greater, a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7) score of 10 or greater, or a score of 2 or greater on the self-harm/suicide risk question on the PHQ-9. A second cohort of adults not at high risk were selected randomly from the remaining screened population. Data were cleaned and analyzed from April 2022 to February 2023. Interventions: The 12-month intervention included a community-based antistigma campaign involving all participants and a digital mental health intervention involving only participants at high risk. Primary health care workers were trained to identify and manage participants at high risk using the Mental Health Gap Action Programme guidelines from the World Health Organization. Main outcomes and measures: The 2 coprimary outcomes assessed at 12 months were mean PHQ-9 scores in the high-risk cohort and mean behavior scores in the combined high-risk and non-high-risk cohorts using the Mental Health Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior scale. Results: Altogether, 9928 participants were recruited (3365 at high risk and 6563 not at high risk; 5638 [57%] female and 4290 [43%] male; mean [SD] age, 43 [16] years) with 9057 (91.2%) followed up at 12 months. Mean PHQ-9 scores at 12 months for the high-risk cohort were lower in the intervention vs control groups (2.77 vs 4.48; mean difference, -1.71; 95% CI, -2.53 to -0.89; P &lt; .001). The remission rate in the high-risk cohort (PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores &lt; 5 and no risk of self-harm) was higher in the intervention vs control group (74.7% vs 50.6%; odds ratio [OR], 2.88; 95% CI, 1.53 to 5.42; P = .001). Across both cohorts, there was no difference in 12-month behavior scores in the intervention vs control group (17.39 vs 17.74; mean difference, -0.35; 95% CI, -1.11 to 0.41; P = .36). Conclusions and relevance: A multifaceted intervention was effective in reducing depression risk but did not improve intended help-seeking behaviors for mental illness.

A one-group pre-/post- test design assessed symptom change over time (baseline, post-treatment, three-month follow-up). Nonparametric tests, including Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Friedman’s related samples tests, were used to assess outcomes. Participants experienced a statistically and clinically significant decrease in depressive symptoms between baseline ( Median = 12.00, n = 8) and post-treatment ( Median = 5.00, n = 7) assessments, as measured by the PHQ-9 ( z = −2.12, p = .034). Similar, though non-significant, patterns were observed for anxiety, via the GAD-7. Friedman’s tests revealed a significant overall pattern of difference on the PHQ-9 across all three timepoints in the expected direction.

It can be hypothesized that these beliefs can be modified with the help of approach‐avoidance modification trainings (AAMTs). In the present study (conducted 2020–2022), we aimed to clarify whether the efficacy of AAMTs can be enhanced by utilizing the expression of emotions to move AAMT stimuli. For this purpose, we tested the feasibility and acceptability of a new AAMT paradigm in which the expression of disgust is used to move stress‐increasing beliefs away from oneself and the expression of positive emotions is used to move stress‐reducing beliefs towards oneself (AAMT‐DP). Additionally, we explored the therapeutic potential of the AAMT‐DP intervention by comparing it to an inactive control condition and to a conventional AAMT in which stimuli are moved by swipe movements ( n = 10 in each condition). The primary outcome was perceived stress 1 week after the training as assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale. Findings indicate sufficient feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and that the decrease in perceived stress in the AAMT‐DP condition was greater than in the inactive control condition ( g = 0.72 [0.10, 1.72]) and than in the swipe control condition (g = 0.64 [0.01, 1.41]). In sum, findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and the therapeutic potential of the AAMT‐DP intervention.

10.2196/47704,Effectiveness of web-based mindfulness-based interventions for patients with cancer: Systematic review and meta-analyses,"Wang, Ting;Tang, Chulei;Jiang, Xiaoman;Guo, Yinning;Zhu, Shuqin;Xu, Qin",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2023.3.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Cancer has emerged as a considerable global health concern, contributing substantially to both morbidity and mortality. Recognizing the urgent need to enhance the overall well-being and quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients, a growing number of researchers have started using online mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in oncology. However, the effectiveness and optimal implementation methods of these interventions remain unknown. Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of online MBIs, encompassing both app- and website-based MBIs, for patients with cancer and provides insights into the potential implementation and sustainability of these interventions in real-world settings. Methods: Searches were conducted across 8 electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, SinoMed, CINAHL Complete, Scopus, and PsycINFO, until December 30, 2022. Randomized controlled trials involving cancer patients aged ≥ 18 years and using app- and website-based MBIs compared to standard care were included. Nonrandomized studies, interventions targeting health professionals or caregivers, and studies lacking sufficient data were excluded. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data using standardized forms, and assessed the risk of bias in the studies using the Cochrane Bias Risk Assessment Tool. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (version 5.4; The Cochrane Collaboration) and the meta package in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used to determine the effects of interventions. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework was used to assess the potential implementation and sustainability of these interventions in real-world settings. Results: Among 4349 articles screened, 15 (0.34%) were included. The total population comprised 1613 participants, of which 870 (53.9%) were in the experimental conditions and 743 (46.1%) were in the control conditions. The results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, the QOL (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.57; P &lt; .001), sleep (SMD −0.36, 95% CI −0.71 to −0.01; P = .04), anxiety (SMD −0.48, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.20; P &lt; .001), depression (SMD −0.36, 95% CI −0.61 to −0.11; P = .005), distress (SMD −0.50, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.26; P &lt; .001), and perceived stress (SMD −0.89, 95% CI −1.33 to −0.45; P = .003) of the app- and website-based MBIs group in patients with cancer was significantly alleviated after the intervention. However, no significant differences were found in the fear of cancer recurrence (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −1.04 to 0.44; P = .39) and posttraumatic growth (SMD 0.08, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.42; P = .66). Most interventions were multicomponent, website-based health self-management programs, widely used by international and multilingual patients with cancer. Conclusions: App- and website-based MBIs show promise for improving mental health and QOL outcomes in patients with cancer, and further research is needed to optimize and customize these interventions for individual physical and mental symptoms.

Patients with risk not responding to treatment have been identified by early change patterns. This study aims to examine whether early changes are superior to baseline parameters in predicting long-term outcome. In a randomized clinical trial with 409 individuals experiencing mild to moderate depressive symptoms using the web-based intervention deprexis, three latent classes were identified (early response after registration, early response after screening and early deterioration) based on early change in the first four weeks of the intervention. Baseline variables and these classes were included in a Stepwise Cox Proportional Hazard Multiple Regression to identify predictors associated with the onset of remission over 36-months. Early change class was a significant predictor of remission over 36 months. Compared to early deterioration after screening, both early response after registration and after screening were associated with a higher likelihood of remission. In sensitivity and secondary analyses, only change class consistently emerged as a predictor of long-term outcome. Early improvement in depression symptoms predicted long-term outcome and those showing early improvement had a higher likelihood of long-term remission. These findings suggest that early changes might be a robust predictor for long-term outcome beyond baseline parameters.

However, to date, no large studies have reported the outcomes of PMPs when delivered by specialist multidisciplinary pain services in routine care. The present study reports (n = 653) the outcomes of an internet-delivered PMP provided as routine care by a specialist Australian regional pain service over a 6-year period. High levels of treatment commencement (85%) and completion (72%) were observed, with more than 80% of patients reporting they were satisfied with the intervention. Clinical improvements were observed from pretreatment to post-treatment (% change, 95% confidence intervals (CI)) in pain-related disability (8.8%; 4.5, 12.8), depression (28.4%; 23.0, 33.4), anxiety (21.9%; 14.6, 28.5), and pain intensity (7%; 3.5, 10.5), which were maintained to 3-month follow-up. At 3-month follow-up, 27% (23, 31), 46% (41, 51), 44% (39, 49), and 22% (19, 26) reported clinically meaningful (defined as ≥ 30%) improvements in pain-related disability, depression, anxiety, and pain intensity, respectively. These results were obtained with relatively little therapist time per patient (M = 30.0, (standard deviation) SD = 18.8) to deliver the intervention. The current findings highlight the potential of internet-delivered PMPs as part of the services provided by specialist pain services, particularly those servicing large geographical regions and for patients unable to travel to clinics for face-to-face care. PERSPECTIVE: This study reports the outcomes of the routine delivery of an internet-delivered psychological PMP by a specialist pain service. The findings highlight the potential of this model of care when provided by specialist pain services, particularly for patients not unable to attend and not requiring intensive face-to-face care.

There is interest in learning how this emerging adult population engages with and responds to treatment. Using data from young adults aged 18 to 30 years ( M age = 25.8, SD = 3.2), taken from 4 previous randomised controlled trials, the current study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an internet-delivered psychological pain-management intervention for young adults with chronic pain. We compared young adults in a treatment group (n = 104) with 1) a young-adult wait-list control group (n = 48), and 2) a treatment group reflecting the average-aged participant from the previous trials (39–63 years, n = 561). Feasibility was determined through treatment engagement, adherence and completion, and acceptability through a treatment satisfaction measure. Clinical outcomes were disability, pain intensity, anxiety, and depression; assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Generalised estimation equation analyses were undertaken, using multiple imputations to account for missing data. Young adults had high engagement and acceptability ratings, though 34% did not complete the intervention. The treatment group significant improved across all outcomes, compared with control, with improvements maintained at follow-up. Post-treatment improvements were equivalent for young-adult and average-aged adult treatment groups, with no significant differences in feasibility or acceptability outcomes. Findings indicate young adults can engage with and show improvements following a psychological pain-management intervention designed for all adults with chronic pain. Future research is encouraged to examine outcomes related to role functioning of young adults, and moderators of treatment acceptability and efficacy for this population. P erspective: Secondary analysis of data from 4 RCTs found an Internet-delivered psychological pain-management intervention acceptable and clinically efficacious for improving disability, anxiety, depression and pain intensity in young adults (18–30) with chronic pain .

Evidence based, online, affordable, and accessible solutions for test anxiety are scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an online delivered, assisted intervention (REST-TA) in a randomized controlled trial. Participants ( N = 178) were recruited through a university course and were randomized into a treatment group and waitlist control group. The treatment group completed an 8-week program which consisted of relaxation, skill training and cognitive behavioral methods. Both treatment and control group filled out a battery of questionnaires (TAMC-SF, STAI, DASS, MBI-SS, Resilience) pre and post-treatment. According to our results there was a significant reduction in test anxiety between pre and post intervention. We found a significant increase in trait anxiety, negative affectivity, and burnout in the control group, while no change or slight decrease in these scores in the treatment group. Our analyses also yielded a significant increase in resilience scores in the treatment group while resilience scores did not change for the control group. We conclude that REST-TA was successful at reducing test anxiety. Moreover, it helped to maintain the subjective well-being of students, while increasing resilience. Online solutions are a scalable option for universities to implement, therefore programs such as REST-TA could be of great help to improve the mental health of university students.

However, little is known about patient treatment preferences for the application nor its impact on clinically salient outcomes. Veterans with PTSD ( N = 20) were randomly assigned to use PE Coach during three-session blocks of treatment (either Sessions 1–3 or 4–6). After Session 6, veterans were asked to choose whether they wanted to continue treatment with or without the app. Homework was monitored, and veterans were surveyed on their treatment experience following each three-session block. Qualitative interviews explored reasons for treatment preference. Thirteen of 14 veterans (92.8%) chose to finish treatment with PE Coach . Veterans reported improved clinical experiences during PE Coach use, including increased convenience completing homework tasks (Hedge’s g = 1.37) and higher treatment satisfaction (Hedge’s g = 0.63). PE Coach usability was highly rated. Adequate homework thresholds for maximizing clinical outcomes were achieved more frequently during use of PE Coach than without the app (69% vs. 50% for imaginal exposure; 88% vs. 65% for in vivo homework). Qualitative interviews highlighted ease of use and improved accessibility, privacy, and homework accountability. This pilot study suggests PE Coach may be some veterans’ preferred way to participate in PE and is a promising tool to enhance acceptability, accountability, and engagement in PTSD treatment.

HeadGear was developed to prevent depression and improve well-being among the working population and was associated with significant positive effects in an efficacy trial. This study presents the results from a naturalistic trial intended to evaluate real-world usage of the app. We examined the naturalistic use of HeadGear between March 2019 and March 2022, using app analytic data, in-app event data, and surveys assessing depressive symptoms, well-being, and work performance repeated at 30-day intervals over 5-month app usage. During the observation period, HeadGear was widely disseminated to the public, and downloaded 26,455 times. Of those who downloaded the app, 12,995 completed baseline. The mean age of users was 38.23 (SD = 12.39) and 60% were women. Approximately one in four met criteria for probable depression at baseline. Depressive symptoms showed consistent improvement at all time points (Cohen’s d ranging from 0.24 at 1 month to 0.13 at 5 months). A similar pattern emerged for well-being. Work performance showed improvement to 2-month follow-up only. The strongest change was found for those with greater symptom severity at baseline, and those with high app engagement. Attrition at follow-up points was high. Findings regarding the real-world use of HeadGear are promising and highlight the use of such apps among those with higher symptom severity (despite the intended use of the app as a prevention tool). Further work is required to tailor mHealth apps to reach their full potential through an enhanced understanding of the utility of individual features for effectiveness and engagement.

Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) are promising to reach individuals facing subclinical symptoms. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic and self-tailored IMI in reducing subclinical anxiety and depressive symptom severity with either individualized (IG-IMI) or automated (AG-IMI) guidance compared to a waitlist control group with care-as-usual access (WLC). Methods: Participants included 566 adults with subclinical anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5) and/or depressive (CES-D ≥16) symptoms, who did not meet criteria for a full-syndrome depressive or anxiety disorder. In a three-arm randomized clinical trial, participants were randomized to a cognitive behavioral 7-session IMI plus booster session with IG-IMI ( n = 186) or AG-IMI ( n = 189) or WLC ( n = 191). Primary outcomes included observer-rated anxiety (HAM-A) and depressive (QIDS) symptom severity 8 weeks after randomization assessed by blinded raters via telephone. Follow-up outcomes at 6 and 12 months are reported. Results: Symptom severity was significantly lower with small to medium effects in IG-IMI (anxiety: d = 0.45, depression: d = 0.43) and AG-IMI (anxiety: d = 0.31, depression : d = 0.32) compared to WLC. No significant differences emerged between guidance formats in primary outcomes. There was a significant effect in HAM-A after 6 months favoring AG-IMI. On average, participants completed 85.38% of IG-IMI and 77.38% of AG-IMI. Conclusions: A transdiagnostic, self-tailored IMI can reduce subclinical anxiety and depressive symptom severity, but 12-month long-term effects were absent. Automated guidance holds promise for enhancing the scalability of IMIs in broad prevention initiatives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

We aimed to estimate the association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response in a large sample and benchmark its prognostic value against baseline symptom severity and variance. Methods N = 40 518 patients receiving treatment for depression in routine care in England from 2015–2020 were analysed. Cross-sectional networks were constructed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for responders and non-responders (N = 20 259 each). To conduct parametric tests investigating the contribution of PHQ-9 sum score mean and variance to connectivity differences, networks were constructed for 160 independent subsamples of responders and non-responders (80 each, n = 250 per sample). Results The baseline non-responder network was more connected than responders (3.15 v. 2.70, S = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001), but effects were small, requiring n = 750 per group to have 85% power. Parametric analyses revealed baseline network connectivity, PHQ-9 sum score mean, and PHQ-9 sum score variance were correlated ( r = 0.20–0.58, all p &lt; 0.001). Both PHQ-9 sum score mean ( β = −1.79, s.e. = 0.07, p &lt; 0.001), and PHQ-9 sum score variance ( β = −1.67, s.e. = 0.09, p &lt; 0.001) had larger effect sizes for predicting response than connectivity ( β = −1.35, s.e. = 0.12, p &lt; 0.001). The association between connectivity and response disappeared when PHQ-9 sum score variance was accounted for ( β = −0.28, s.e. = 0.19, p = 0.14). We replicated these results in patients completing longer treatment (8–12 weeks, N = 22 952) and using anxiety symptom networks ( N = 70 620). Conclusions The association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response may be largely due to differences in baseline score variance.

One way to address this need is to develop and test if culturally responsive mobile health (mhealth) applications are efficacious in reducing stress-related outcomes in this population. With this goal in mind, we employed a repeated-measures randomized control trial (RCT) across a 12-week intervention period to evaluate if participants in the intervention group outperformed a wait-list control group in reductions in stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, emotional regulation difficulties as well as in increases in self-compassion, resilience, and mindfulness attitudes and behaviors. Our sample included 170 Black/African American participants who were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition (n = 84) or the wait-list control group (n = 86). Participants in the intervention condition reported more self-compassion, used more mindfulness, and had greater self-efficacy using mindfulness; yet, no other differences were evident. Participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the app and gave it a positive rating for its relevance to their lives. These findings support the efficacy of a culturally responsive mindfulness mHealth app to enhance self-compassion and increase the use of health-promoting behaviors, like mindfulness, among African Americans. Implications for future research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2024-19408-001). Objective: To develop and evaluate the effects of an interactive coaching intervention, using a self-management mobile application, on quality of life and physical and psychological factors for colorectal cancer survivors. Methods: We developed a self-management mobile application providing social support services for post-treatment CRC survivors and evaluated its effects through baseline and post-intervention surveys. Using the biopsychosocial holistic model as the theoretical framework, automated interactive coaching technology was applied for six weeks to provide supportive services tailored for each user. To evaluate the effects of the application, self-efficacy, health practice index, depression, fear of cancer recurrence, and quality of life measures were administered to participants. A total of 34 men and 5 women were included in the analysis. Results: Participants’ mean age were 54.10 years and 78% of them had been diagnosed within the last five years. There were significant increases in self-efficacy (z = 2.09, p = .04), health practice index (t = 2.35, p = .02), and quality of life (t = 2.03, p = .05). More specifically, the emotional functional score increased (z = 2.23, p = .03) while both of the total symptom score (t = 2.10, p = .04) and the fatigue symptom score (z = 2.54, p = .01) decreased after six weeks of using the mobile application. Conclusions: Interventions supporting colorectal cancer survivors’ self-management are critical for addressing the challenges they face after treatment and improving their quality of life. Providing social support through mobile applications could be a good strategy in terms of usability and effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)"

However, there is insufficient evidence of its effectiveness across racial and ethnic groups. This study evaluated outcomes of a BCT program, which combined video psychotherapy with internet cognitive-behavioral modules, across race and ethnicity. Methods: Participants were 6492 adults, with elevated anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7] ≥ 8) and/or depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] ≥ 10) symptoms, enrolled in employer-offered BCT. Changes in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) symptoms during treatment were evaluated using individual growth curve models. Interaction terms of time with race and ethnicity tested for between-group differences. Treatment satisfaction was assessed using a Net Promoter measure (range = 1 (lowest satisfaction) to 5 (greatest satisfaction)). Results: Participants’ self-reported race and ethnicity included Asian or Pacific Islander (27.5%), Black or African American (5.4%), Hispanic or Latino (9.3%), and White (47.2%). Anxiety symptoms decreased during treatment ( p &lt; 0.01), with greater reductions among Hispanic or Latino participants compared to White participants ( p &lt; 0.05). Depressive symptoms decreased across treatment ( p &lt; 0.01), with significantly greater decreases among some racial and ethnic groups compared to White participants. Declines in anxiety and depressive symptoms slowed across treatment ( p ’s &lt; 0.01), with statistically significant differences in slowing rates of depressive symptoms across some racial and ethnic groups. Among participants with responses (28.45%), average treatment satisfaction ranged from 4.46 (SD = 0.73) to 4.67 (SD = 0.68) across race and ethnicity ( p = 0.001). Racial and ethnic differences in outcomes were small in magnitude. Conclusions: BCT for anxiety and depression can be effective across diverse racial and ethnic groups.

However, accurate recording of thoughts and emotions is challenging when CR is provided in internet cognitivebehavior therapy (iCBT). This study investigated the potential use of the artificial intelligence (AI) including the natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate CR offered in iCBT. Methods We applied the Japanese Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5), one of the most advanced Large Language Models for the NLP,to records of thought-feeling pairs provided by participants in two randomized controlled trials of iCBT. We conducted threefold cross-validated prediction of self-reported feelings based on recorded thoughts. We examined the validity of the predictions by checking them against the human expert judgments and by the efficacy when the thought records were subjected to CR. Results 1626 participants provided 4369 though-feeling records. The overall prediction accuracy was 73.5%. The selfreported feelings matched the human expert judgments more frequently when they were correctly predicted by the T5 than not (90% vs 37.5%, 95%CI of difference: 34.8 to 70.2%). When subjected to CR, the correctly predicted thought-feeling pairs led to greater reductions in negative feelings than the incorrectly predicted pairs (− 1.54 vs − 1.43 on a scale of 0 to 5, 95%CI of difference: 0.03 to 0.19). Conclusions A new CR module of an iCBT application can incorporate this model and advise the users to revisit and revise their automatic thoughts to reflect their feelings more accurately. Whether such an iCBT application can ultimately lead to greater reductions in depression is to be examined in a future randomized trial.

This study evaluated the initial efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a novel online self-guided cognitive intervention for new parents with distressing UITs. Self-recruited parents ( N = 43, 93% female, age 23–43 years) of children 0–3 years reporting daily distressing and impairing UITs were randomized to the 8-week self-guided online cognitive intervention or to waiting-list. The primary outcome was change on the Parental Thoughts and Behaviour Checklist (PTBC) from baseline to week 8 (post-intervention). The PTBC and negative appraisals (mediator) were assessed at baseline, weekly, post-intervention and at the 1-month follow-up. Results showed that the intervention led to statistically significant reductions in distress and impairment associated with UITs at postintervention (controlled between-group d = 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.43), which were maintained at the 1-month follow-up (controlled between-group d = 0.90, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.39). The intervention was deemed to be feasible and acceptable by the participants. Change in negative appraisals mediated reductions in UITs but the model was sensitive to mediator-outcome confounders. We conclude that this novel online self-guided cognitive intervention can potentially reduce the distress and impairment associated with UITs in new parents. Large-scale trials are warranted.

10.1371/journal.pone.0278252,Evaluating the effectiveness of mindfulness alone compared to exercise and mindfulness on fatigue in women with gynaecology cancer (GEMS): Protocol for a randomised feasibility trial,"McCloy, Kairen;Hughes, Ciara;Dunwoody, Lynn;Marley, Joanne;Cleland, Ian;Cruciani, Federico;Saunders, Catherine;Gracey, Jackie",PLoS ONE,,2022.11.12,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: In 2020 Globocan reported nearly 1.4 million new cases of gynaecology cancer worldwide. Cancer related fatigue has been identified as a symptom that can be present for gynaecology cancer patients many years after treatment. The current evidence around the management of this symptom suggests that exercise has the most positive outcome. However, some ambiguity remains around the evidence and whether it can address all areas of fatigue effectively. More recently, other interventions such as mindfulness have begun to show a favourable response to the management of symptoms for cancer patients. To date there has been little research that explores the feasibility of using both these interventions together in a gynaecology cancer population. This study aims to explore the feasibility of delivering an intervention that involves mindfulness and mindfulness and exercise and will explore the effect of this on fatigue, sleep, mood and quality of life. Methods/Design: This randomised control trial will assess the interventions outcomes using a pre and post design and will also include a qualitative process evaluation. Participants will be randomised into one of 2 groups. One group will undertake mindfulness only and the other group will complete exercise and mindfulness. Both groups will use a mobile application to complete these interventions over 8 weeks. The mobile app will be tailored to reflect the group the participants have drawn during randomisation. Self-reported questionnaire data will be assessed at baseline prior to commencing intervention and at post intervention. Feasibility will be assessed through recruitment, adherence, retention and attrition. Acceptability and participant perspective of participation (process evaluation), will be explored using focus groups. Discussion: This trial will hope to evidence and demonstrate that combination of two interventions such as mindfulness and exercise will further improve outcomes of fatigue and wellbeing in gynaecology cancer. The results of this study will be used to assess (i) the feasibility to deliver this type of intervention to this population of cancer patients using a digital platform; (ii) assist this group of women diagnosed with cancer to manage fatigue and other symptoms of sleep, mood and impact their quality of life.

10.1371/journal.pone.0291168,The mechanism and effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention for reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol of randomized control trial of ecological momentary intervention and assessment,"Wang, Qi;Ng, Siu-man;Zhou, Xiaochen",PLoS ONE,,2023.4.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents’ appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants’ cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD. Method: The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants’ psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants’ subjective wellbeing, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress. Discussion: The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

10.2196/44365,Effects of induced mindfulness at night on repetitive negative thinking: Ecological momentary assessment study,"Sommerhoff, Amanda;Ehring, Thomas;Takano, Keisuke",JMIR Mental Health,,2022.11.21,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a cognitive risk factor for various disorders. Although brief mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs; lasting 20-30 minutes or shorter) are effective tools to reduce RNT, the effect of a minimal (5-minute) MBI remains largely unknown. Objective: We investigated the acute changes in RNT induced by a 10-day minimal MBI (body scan before sleeping) using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) administered during the MBI training phase. In addition, we examined longer-term effects on the postintervention and 2-month follow-up assessments for questionnaire-based RNT and psychological distress. Methods: A total of 68 participants (community sample, aged 18-55 years; n=58, 85% women) were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (n=35, 51%) or the no-training control group (n=33, 49%). Both groups completed a 10-day EMA phase of RNT, during which only the intervention group performed a daily 5-minute body scan before sleeping. Results: The intervention group showed a significantly larger reduction in questionnaire-based RNT than the control group at the follow-up assessment (for growth-curve modeling analysis [GMA], d GMA =−0.91; P &lt;.001), but this effect was not observed during the EMA phase or at the postintervention assessment. Furthermore, the intervention group showed significantly larger decreases in stress both at the postintervention ( d GMA =−0.78; P &lt;.001) and follow-up ( d GMA =−0.60; P &lt;.001) assessments than the control group. We found no intervention effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: A 5-minute body scan before sleeping reduces RNT and stress when continued for at least 10 days; however, the results suggest that this effect only appears with some time lag because no acute changes during and immediately after the intervention emerged for RNT.

However, the day-to-day variability of this feature is unknown. To investigate this, healthy participants recorded their own brain activity daily at home using the Muse 2 headband, a low-cost consumer-grade mobile electroencephalography (EEG) device. Resting-state recordings of all participants using a high-density (HD) EEG were also collected in lab before and after the at-home data collection period. We found that the IAF extracted from the Muse 2 was comparable to that of location-matched HD-EEG electrodes. No significant difference was found between these IAF values before and after the at-home recording period for the HD-EEG device. Similarly, there was also no statistically significant difference between the beginning and end of the at-home recording period for the Muse 2 headband over 1 month. Despite the group-level stability of IAF, the individual-level day-to-day IAF variability carried mental health-relevant information: Exploratory analyses revealed a relationship between IAF day-today variability and trait anxiety. We also noted that the IAF systematically varied across the scalp and although the Muse 2 electrodes do not cover the occipital lobe where alpha oscillations were the strongest, IAFs measured in the temporal lobe and occipital lobe were strongly correlated. Altogether, these results show that mobile EEG devices are useful for studying IAF variability. The relationship between day-to-day variability of region-specific IAF and the dynamics of psychiatric symptoms, particularly anxiety, should be further investigated.

10.2196/43929,Validation of the Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions Questionnaire among Black Americans: Cross-cultural confirmatory factor analysis,"Ellis, Donovan Michael;Anderson, Page Lyn",JMIR Mental Health,,2022.11.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Acceptability of digital mental health interventions is a significant predictor of treatment-seeking behavior and engagement. However, acceptability has been conceptualized and operationalized in various ways, which decreases measurement precision and leads to heterogeneous conclusions about acceptability. Standardized self-report measures of acceptability have been developed, which have the potential to ameliorate these problems, but none have demonstrated evidence for validation among Black communities, which limits our understanding of attitudes toward these interventions among racially minoritized groups with well-documented barriers to mental health treatment. Objective: This study aims to examine the psychometric validity and reliability of one of the first and most widely used measures of acceptability, the Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions Questionnaire, among a Black American sample. Methods: Participants (N=254) were recruited from a large southeastern university and the surrounding metropolitan area and completed the self-report measure via a web-based survey. A confirmatory factor analysis using mean and variance adjusted weighted least squares estimation was conducted to examine the validity of the underlying hierarchical 4-factor structure proposed by the original authors of the scale. An alternative, hierarchical 2-factor structure model and bifactor model were examined for comparative fit. Results: The findings indicated that the bifactor model demonstrated a superior fit (comparative fit index=0.96, Tucker-Lewis index=0.94, standardized root mean squared residual=0.03, and root mean square error of approximation=0.09) compared with both 2- and 4-factor hierarchical structure models. Conclusions: The findings suggest that, within a Black American sample, there may be greater utility in interpreting the Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions Questionnaire subscales as attitudinal constructs that are distinct from the global acceptability factor. The theoretical and practical implications for culturally responsive measurements were explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1159/000527868,What predicts treatment adherence and low-risk drinking? An exploratory study of internet interventions for alcohol use disorders,"Sundström, Christopher;Eék, Niels;Kraepelien, Martin;Kaldo, Viktor;Berman, Anne H.",European Addiction Research,,2022.4.14,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: Internet interventions for alcohol problems are effective, but not all participants are helped. Further, the importance of adherence has often been neglected in research on internet interventions for alcohol problems. Prediction analysis can help in prospectively assessing participants’ probability of success, and ideally, this information could be used to tailor internet interventions to individual needs. Methods: Data were obtained from a randomized controlled trial on internet interventions for alcohol use disorders. Twenty-nine candidate predictors were run in univariate logistic regressions with two dichotomous dependent outcomes: adherence (defined as completing at least 60% of the treatment modules) and low-risk drinking (defined as drinking within national public health guidelines) at two time points—immediately post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. Significant predictors were entered hierarchically into domain-specific logistic regressions. In the final models, predictors still showing significant effects were run in multiple logistic regressions. Results: One predictor significantly predicted adherence: treatment credibility (as in how logical the treatment is and how successful one perceives the treatment to be) assessed during the third week of the intervention. Four predictors significantly predicted low-risk drinking at the post-treatment follow-up: pre-treatment abstinence (i.e., not drinking during the 7 days before treatment started), being of the male gender, and two personality factors —a low degree of antagonism and a high degree of alexithymia. At the 6-month follow-up, pre-treatment abstinence was the only significant predictor. Conclusion: Adherence was not predictive of low-risk drinking. Personality variables may have predictive value and should be studied further. Those who abstain from alcohol during the week before treatment starts have a higher likelihood of achieving low-risk drinking than people who initially continue drinking.

Web-based mental health interventions provide a scalable and cost-effective approach to providing psychological support for people disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a one-week web-based psychological intervention (ACT2COPE) and explore preliminary effects of the intervention on reducing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and improving wellbeing and psychological flexibility in adults living with CHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Aotearoa (New Zealand). A pilot randomised waitlist-controlled trial explored the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of ACT2COPE among 40 participants ( n = 20 in the ACT2COPE group and n = 20 in the waitlist control group). Focus groups and open-ended questions explored usability and acceptability of the intervention as well as levels of engagement and adherence to the intervention. Mixed model ANOVAs explored within and between-group differences in psychological outcomes. Qualitative findings suggested that participants found ACT2COPE acceptable and engaging. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased over time compared to the waitlist group at 4-weeks follow-up ( p = .012). No other between-group differences were found. The online ACT2COPE intervention presents a promising, scalable intervention that may improve psychological outcomes in adults living with CHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many adolescents reported increased anxiety and depression as well as decreased psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Consequently, there is a need for psychological support that exceeds the strained resources available to schools to support young people during times of crisis and societal pressure. Objective: The present study aimed to explore the effects of an online-delivered ACT intervention to promote adolescent psychological flexibility and self-compassion and decrease psychological distress during the second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020. Methods: A total of 348 adolescents aged 15–16 were randomly divided into three equal groups: 1) the iACT student coach + virtual coach group, n = 116; 2) the iACT virtual coach group, n = 116; and 3) the control group with no intervention, n = 116). Among these adolescents, 234 participated in a pre-measurement (iACT, n = 154; control, n = 80; intent-to-treat) and completed measures of psychological flexibility, self-compassion, anxiety, and depression. Results: An investigation of all the adolescents who participated in the pre-measurement (intent-to-treat analysis, n = 234) revealed no significant differences between the three groups with regard to psychological flexibility, self-compassion, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, upon combining the two intervention groups and examining the adolescents who completed at least 30% of the Youth Compass program (per-protocol analysis, n = 137), small but significant differences between the iACT intervention and control groups were found regarding the psychological flexibility subscale valued action, self-compassion, and anxiety in favor of the intervention group. Conclusions: Active use of an ACT-based online intervention under adverse circumstances may decrease symptoms of anxiety and increase psychological flexibility skills in adolescents.

Methods: Seventy-one university students with elevated perfectionism were randomized to either the ETP group (n = 36) or the waitlist (WL) control group (n = 35). The ETP group was asked to complete the intervention at home, every three days for two weeks for a total of five treatment sessions. The tasks in the ETP condition were engineered to have participants repeatedly make mistakes. All participants returned two weeks after the baseline visit for a post-treatment assessment. Results: Compared to WL, ETP led to lower overall perfectionism, concern over mistakes, personal standards, depressive symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, and error sensitivity at post-treatment. No effects of treatment were found on trait anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or eating disorder symptoms. Limitations: Participants were university students of similar age and education level, which restricts generalizability. Additionally, the study relied on a waitlist control condition. Conclusions: This study provided preliminary evidence for a novel online intervention for perfectionism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.980848,Characteristics and trends in acceptance and commitment therapy research: A bibliometric analysis,"Li, Zhihong;Shang, Wenru;Wang, Caiyun;Yang, Kehu;Guo, Juanmei",Frontiers in Psychology,,2022.6.29,Scholarly Journals,English,"Purpose: As acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) becomes mainstream and a growing body of literature emerges, it is critical to map the global collaborative network and a quantitative and systematic assessment of ACT, as research on this topic is still lacking. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trajectory, key themes, and future prospects in ACT research. Methods: Publications were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection before 2022. Excel 2019, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace software were used to analyze the characteristics and trends of ACT research. Examples include publications trend analysis, authors’ cooperation network analysis, keywords co-occurrence analysis, and citation burst analysis. Results: A total of 799 articles in 314 journals contributed by 2,862 authors from 958 institutions in 52 countries were identified. The number of publications has increased significantly since 2015. The United States/Utah State University is the most productive country/institution; Karolinska Institute, Utah State University, and King’s College of London are the most significant nodes. Twohig M.P., Hayes S.C., and Levin M.E. are the most influential authors. Keyword co-occurrence analysis found the curative mechanisms, using network technology or mobile technology as adjuvant therapy, reducing psychological diseases of cancer patients were potential trends. Conclusion: This review is the first attempt of its kind to systematically examine the knowledge structure and draw an evidence map of ACT research. It deepens the understanding of existing research, gives many operable research directions and suggests to future ACT research.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.969115,An analysis of patient motivation for seeking online treatment for binge eating disorder—A mixed methods study combining systematic text condensation with sentiment analysis,"Holmberg, Trine Theresa;Sainte-Marie, Maxime;Jensen, Esben Kjems;Linnet, Jakob;Runge, Eik;Lichtenstein, Mia Beck;Tarp, Kristine",Frontiers in Psychiatry,,2022.6.14,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Online treatment for binge eating disorder (BED) is an easily available option for treatment compared to most standard treatment procedures. However, little is known about how motivation types characterize this population and how these impact treatment adherence and effect in an online setting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate a sample of written motivation statements from BED patients, to learn more about how treatment and online treatment in particular, presents in this population. Methods: Using self-determination theory in a mixed methods context, we investigated which types of motivation were prevalent in our sample, how this was connected with patient sentiment, and how these constructs influence treatment and adherence. Results: Contrary to what most current literature suggests, we found that in our sample ( n = 148), motivation type was not connected with treatment outcome. We did find a strong association between sentiment scores and motivation types, indicating the model is apt at detecting effects. We found that when comparing an adult and young adult population, they did not differ in motivation type and the treatment was equally effective in young adults and adults. In the sentiment scores there was a difference between sentiment score and adherence in the young adult group, as the more positive the young adults were, the less likely they were to complete the program. Discussion: Because motivation type does not influence online treatment to the same degree as it would in face-to-face treatment it indicates that the typical barriers to treatment may be less crucial in an online setting. This should be considered during intake; as less motivated patients may be able to adhere better to online treatment, because the latter imposes fewer barriers of the kind that only strong motivation can overcome. The fact that motivation type and sentiment score of the written texts are strongly associated, indicate a potential for automated models to detect motivation based on sentiment.

Objective: This study aimed to conduct within-trial cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of an internet-based intervention for people with BD, MoodSwings 2.0, from an Australian health sector perspective. Methods: MoodSwings 2.0 included an economic evaluation alongside an international, parallel, and individually stratified randomized controlled trial comparing an internet-based discussion forum (control; group 1), a discussion forum plus internet-based psychoeducation (group 2), and a discussion forum plus psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral tools (group 3). The trial enrolled adults (aged 21 to 65 years) with a diagnosis of BD assessed by telephone using a structured clinical interview. Health sector costs included intervention delivery and additional health care resources used by participants over the 12-month trial follow-up. Outcomes included depression symptoms measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; the trial primary outcome) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the short-form 6-dimension instrument derived from the 12-item version of the short-form health survey. Average incremental cost-effectiveness (cost per MADRS score) and cost-utility (cost per QALY) ratios were calculated using estimated mean differences between intervention and control groups from linear mixed effects models in the base case. Results: In total, 304 participants were randomized. Average health sector cost was lowest for group 2 (Aus $9431, SD Aus $8540; Aus $1 = US $0.7058) compared with the control group (Aus $15,175, SD Aus $17,206) and group 3 (Aus $15,518, SD Aus $30,523), but none was statistically significantly different. The average QALYs were not significantly different among the groups (group 1: 0.627, SD 0.062; group 2: 0.618, SD 0.094; and group 3: 0.622, SD 0.087). The MADRS scores were previously shown to differ significantly between group 2 and the control group at all follow-up time points (P &lt; .05). Group 2 was dominant (lower costs and greater effects) compared with the control group for average incremental cost per point decrease in MADRS score over 12 months (95% CI dominated to Aus $331). Average cost per point change in MADRS score for group 3 versus the control group was dominant (95% CI dominant to Aus $22,585). Group 2 was dominant (95% CI Aus $43,000 to dominant) over the control group based on lower average health sector cost and average QALY benefit of 0.012 (95% CI –0.009 to 0.033). Group 3, compared with the control group, had an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dominant (95% CI dominated to Aus $19,978). Conclusions: Web-based psychoeducation through MoodSwings 2.0 has the potential to be a cost-effective intervention for people with BD. Additional research is needed to understand the lack of effectiveness for the addition of cognitive behavioral tools with the group 3 intervention.

Internet programs can reach women who may not access traditional treatments due to distance, stigma or concern about taking medication. We adapted our online postnatal depression program, MumMoodBooster, for antenatal use. We aimed to trial feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the new Mum2BMoodBooster intervention with depressed pregnant women. Methods: Twenty-seven pregnant women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score &gt; 11 used the program in a feasibility trial. Twenty-one had current diagnoses of major or minor depression on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Assessment of symptoms occurred at screening/baseline, post-test (8 weeks post-enrollment), and at follow-up (3 months postpartum) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Results: In this feasibility trial, depression scores on both the PHQ-9 and the DASS-21, showed significant reductions representing large effects, with average symptom scores reduced by &gt; 50%, and maintained in the ‘minimal or no depression’ range at 3 month follow-up. Anxiety scores also decreased significantly. Program usage was high with 74% of women visiting all six sessions. Program acceptability ratings were moderate to high. Conclusions: Findings paralleled the magnitude of symptom reductions seen in randomised trials of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, suggesting that Mum2BMoodBooster is an effective treatment for depressed pregnant women. Effective internet therapies are likely to become increasingly important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make face-to-face access to health care problematic during ‘lockdowns’. 202207570 (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

In the original article, the author affiliations were published incorrectly. Cathy Creswell should have an additional affiliation of the University of Reading. The correct affiliations are given in the erratum.] Background: Online treatments for child anxiety offer a potentially cost-effective and non-stigmatizing means to widen access to evidence-based treatments and meet the increasing demand on services; however, uptake in routine clinical practice remains a challenge. This study conducted an initial evaluation of the clinical effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of OSI (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) within clinical practice. OSI is a co-designed online therapist-supported, parent-led CBT treatment for pre-adolescent children with anxiety problems. Method: This case series was part of routine service evaluation in a clinic in England where families were offered OSI to treat a primary anxiety difficulty among 7- to 12-year-old children; 24 families were offered OSI, and 23 took it up. Measures of anxiety symptomatology, functional impairment and progress towards therapeutic goals were taken at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 4-week follow-up. Treatment satisfaction and engagement were also measured throughout the intervention. Results: Mean anxiety symptoms significantly improved to below the clinical cut-off post-treatment, with further reduction at follow-up. Functional impairment also significantly improved and significant progress was made towards treatment goals. The majority of children showed reliable change in anxiety symptoms and reliable recovery by follow-up, and were discharged without needing further treatment for anxiety. Uptake, adherence and engagement in OSI were excellent, and parents reported high levels of satisfaction with the treatment. Conclusions: We have provided initial evidence that OSI is feasible, acceptable to families, and appears to be associated with good outcomes within routine clinical practice.

The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a brief internet intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for promoting general mental health among college students. As far as can be determined, the impact of an online guided self-help version of (i) contact with the present moment, (ii) cognitive defusion and (iii) self-as-context processes of ACT on mental health has never been tested in a student-based randomized trial. The current study was a randomized controlled wait-list trial consisting of a 3-week intervention and a 3-week follow-up phase. Out of 174 participants, 113 were included in the analysis. Inclusion criteria were: (1) no formal diagnosis of mental health disorders, (2) no previous experience of ACT, mindfulness or mindfulness-based exercises, (3) over 18 years of age, and (4) currently registered as a university or college student. Participants were randomly assigned to an ACT-based intervention (N = 87) or a wait-list control (N = 87). Neither investigators nor participants were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome measure was general mental health (GHQ-12). Depression, Anxiety and Stress were also measured (DASS-21) as well as psychological flexibility (AAQ-2) at pre- and post-intervention, and 3-week follow-up. The results indicated significant improvements in general mental health in the ACT processes group compared with the wait-list control group ( p = .005, d = 0.48) at post treatment but not at follow-up. There were no significant differences between the groups on any other outcome measures. The results from this study provide some support for the effectiveness of a brief web-based ACT intervention to enhance general mental health. However, there were no significant comparative improvements, but trends, for depression, anxiety or stress. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

It is well-known that there is a large gap between the availability of evidence-supported psychotherapy for depression and the large number of people who would likely benefit from it. DHMIs based on a cognitive-behavioral (CBT) model have shown substantial promise as a method to deliver tested-effective treatment to large numbers of people experiencing depression. The article continues with a review of clinical research evaluating DMHIs for depression with a special emphasis on CBT. The article also reviews both the strengths and challenges associated with the clinical use of DHMI for depression.

As DMHTs are adopted by healthcare organizations, payers, and employers, they are often considered most appropriate for people with mild-to-moderate levels of symptom severity. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of symptom severity on depression and anxiety outcomes and app use across three trials of a guided DMHT, IntelliCare. Participants were categorized into mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe symptom severity groups on depression and anxiety. All symptom severity groups showed significant reductions in depression and anxiety in a clear ordinal pattern, with the mild symptom severity group showing the smallest changes and the severe symptom group showing the largest improvements. Those with the lowest levels of educational attainment showed the largest symptom improvement. Baseline symptom severity was not significantly related to app use. App use was significantly related to depression and anxiety outcomes. These findings suggest that depression and anxiety symptom severity is not useful in determining who should be referred to a guided DMHT.

We evaluated acceptance and short as well as long‐term efficacy of our 8‐session internet‐based GSH program in a randomized clinical trial with an immediate treatment group, and two waitlist control groups, which differed with respect to whether patients received positive expectation induction during waiting or not. Method: Sixty‐three patients (87% female, mean age 37.2 years) followed the eight‐session guided cognitive‐behavioural internet‐based program and three booster sessions in a randomized clinical trial design including an immediate treatment and two waitlist control conditions. Outcomes were treatment acceptance, number of weekly binge‐eating episodes, eating disorder pathology, depressiveness, and level of psychosocial functioning. Results: Treatment satisfaction was high, even though 27% of all patients dropped out during the active treatment and 9.5% during the follow‐up period of 6 months. The treatment, in contrast to the waiting conditions, led to a significant reduction of weekly binge‐eating episodes from 3.4 to 1.7 with no apparent rebound effect during follow‐up. All other outcomes improved as well during active treatment. Email‐based positive expectation induction during waiting period prior to the treatment did not have an additional beneficial effect on the temporal course and thus treatment success, of binge episodes in this study. Conclusion: This short internet‐based program was clearly accepted and highly effective regarding core features of BED. Dropout rates were higher in the active and lower in the follow‐up period. Positive expectations did not have an impact on treatment effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Integrated treatment targeting both at the same time is often considered more complicated and difficult and, therefore, more expensive. Consequently, integrated internet-based interventions could be a valuable addition to traditional care. Methods: A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the effectiveness of (1) an integrated, minimal-guidance, adherence-focused self-help intervention designed to reduce both alcohol use and depression symptoms (AFGE-AD); (2) a similar intervention designed to reduce alcohol use only (AFGE-AO), and (3) internet access as usual (IAU) as a control condition, in at least moderately depressed alcohol misusers from February 2016—March 2020. We recruited 689 alcohol misusers (51.6 % males, mean age = 42.8 years) with at least moderate depression symptoms not otherwise in treatment from the general population. Six months after baseline, 288 subjects (41.8 %) were reachable for the final assessment. Results: All interventions yielded reduced alcohol-use after six months (AFGE-AD: -16.6; AFGE-AO: -19.8; IAU: -13.2). Those who undertook active-interventions reported significantly fewer standard drinks than controls (AFGE-AD: p = .048, d=0.10; AFGE-AO: p = .004, d=0.20). The two active-intervention groups also reported significantly less severe depression symptoms than controls (AFGE-AD: p = .006, d=0.41; AFGE-AO: p = .008, d=0.43). Testing revealed noninferiority between the two interventions. Conclusions: This study documented sustained effectiveness of the first integrated, fully internet-based self-help intervention developed for the reduction of both alcohol use and depression symptoms in at least moderately depressed adult alcohol misusers recruited from the general population.

Peer-led interventions have been advantageous in improving physical activity among individuals at health risk. This study aimed to discover whether an ACT-based peer-tutored online intervention can increase self-reported physical activity participation and psychological flexibility among adults with overweight. Design: The study was a non-randomized longitudinal intervention study. The intervention participants ( N = 177) were primary health care clients with overweight. They participated in a 24-month program provided by health services, including three online modules of ACT of six week each, and tutoring by trained peers via five group meetings and four phone calls. Main outcome measures and results: Physical activity participation was measured with Kasari's FIT index concerning the frequency, intensity and time of the physical activity. Psychological flexibility was measured with AAQ-II, and thought suppression, as a dimension of psychological flexibility, with WBSI. Measures were taken at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 months. The statistical analysis was conducted with Mplus to identify latent groups with similar change patterns of physical activity, and to examine differences between the profiles. Two change profiles for physical activity participation were found: Low and High. At baseline in High profile group, physical activity and psychological flexibility were higher and thought suppression was lower than they were in Low profile group, as was expressing other psychological symptoms measured by DASS. During the intervention, physical activity increased significantly only within Low profile (within Cohen's d = .48). Psychological flexibility (AAQ-II) increased within High profile (within Cohen's d = .34), and thought suppression (WBSI) decreased in both profiles (within Cohen's d = .33). Conclusion: The ACT-based peer-tutored online intervention was promising especially for participants with low physical activity participation.

F.",Depression and Anxiety,,2020.7.2,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC, Norwegian adaption of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) has shown effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to treatment as usual (TAU). In this secondary analysis, we examine the effectiveness of PMHC among clients presenting with symptoms of social anxiety disorder (SAD) and/or agoraphobia on core symptoms at 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up. Methods: Randomized controlled trial in two PMHC sites (70:30 ratio PMHC:TAU). Of participants, 61.3% ( n = 472) scored at caseness for SAD and 47.7% ( n = 367) for agoraphobia (40% both). Effects on SAD avoidance and physiological discomfort (SPIN‐9), SAD cognitions (ATQ‐SA), agoraphobic avoidance (MIA‐8), and agoraphobic cognitions (ATQ‐AP) were examined in piecewise growth models. Results: The PMHC group showed substantially greater symptom reduction than the TAU group for all outcomes: At 6‐month follow‐up, the between‐group effect sizes were d −0.60 (95% CI: −0.94 to −0.26) for SPIN‐9, −0.45 (95% CI: −0.70 to −0.20) for ATQ‐SA, −0.50 (95% CI: −0.87 to −0.13) for MIA‐8, and −0.61 (95% CI: −0.92 to −0.31) for ATQ‐AP. All effects were sustained at similar level at a 12‐month follow‐up. Conclusion: PMHC effectively alleviated SAD and agoraphobia symptoms, and individuals struggling with such symptoms constituted a large proportion of clients. Although results should be interpreted with caution due to risk of attrition bias, they lend further support for a scale‐up of PMHC and similar initiatives. Individuals struggling with SAD and/or agoraphobia stood out as relatively high burdened, whereas only one of five had sought help the last 12 months, underscoring the need for the PMHC service.

Blair",Behavior Therapy,,2019.11.23,Scholarly Journals,English,"Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) do not receive evidence-based care (specifically exposure and ritual prevention; EX/RP) due to barriers such as a lack of EX/RP-trained clinicians, geographic obstacles, and the cost and time associated with the treatment. Offering an integrated treatment model consisting of brief in-person therapy coupled with a mobile application (app) might be one way to increase access to and reduce the time burden (to clinicians and patients) of EX/RP. This pilot trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical effects of such a treatment program for adults with OCD. Thirty-three participants enrolled in the 8-week open trial. The integrated treatment program consisted of 3 to 5 in-person sessions followed by weekly phone calls supported by a mobile app (nOCD). Participants were evaluated by trained raters and completed self-report measures at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment and 2-month follow-up; the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was the primary outcome. This integrated treatment program was feasible and acceptable to participants. Of the 33 study entrants, 14 (42%) responded to treatment (Y-BOCS decrease ≥35% with CGI- of 1 or 2), and 8 (24%) achieved minimal symptoms (i.e., Y-BOCS ≤12). At 2-month follow-up (n =20), 7/20 (35%) met criteria for treatment response, and 3/20 (15.0%) met criteria for treatment remission. Although preliminary, this model warrants further study as an efficacious and resource-efficient way to deliver EX/RP for some patients with OCD.

Sleep restriction therapy (SRT) is an effective behavioral treatment but its delivery is impeded by a shortage of trained clinicians. We developed a mobile app delivering SRT to individuals with insomnia. This feasibility study employed a mixed-methods design to examine the engagement, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the mobile app. Fifteen participants diagnosed with insomnia disorder used the mobile app synchronized with a wearable device for 3 weeks. Those who persisted with the study ( n = 12) found the mobile app to be highly acceptable and engaging, logging on average 19 nightly sleep diary entries across the 21 day period. Significant improvements were observed for sleep measures (insomnia severity and sleep efficiency) and daytime symptoms (fatigue and sleepiness). The results suggest that a mobile app delivering SRT to individuals with insomnia is engaging, acceptable, and potentially efficacious. Further, a full-scale effectiveness study is warranted.

10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106686,Behavioral modification decreases approach bias in young adults with internet gaming disorder,"He, Jinbo;Pan, Ting;Nie, Yufeng;Zheng, Yang;Chen, Suqing",Addictive Behaviors,,2020.6.6,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: One of the key symptoms of Internet gaming disorder is the impulsive pursuit of Internet games, which causes individuals with this disorder to have a tendency to approach gaming cues. Dual processing theory states that this approach bias is caused by the suppression of reflective processing and the hyperactivity of impulsive processing. Therefore, reverse modification training for approach bias can suppress impulsive processing, thereby reducing or treating the disorder. Method: In this study, 48 individuals with Internet gaming disorder were selected and randomly assigned to the following two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The 24 participants in the experimental group received a 4-day stimulus–response compatibility (SRC) approach bias modification treatment, whereas the 24 participants in the control group received a corresponding SRC pseudomodification training. Results: The approach response time of both groups to the gaming cues was significantly shorter than that to the neutral cues at baseline. After the modification, the response time of the experimental group to the gaming cues significantly increased, whereas the scores for Internet gaming disorder severity, anxiety level and craving significantly decreased. However, the control group subjects did not show these effects. Conclusion: The current results imply that individuals with Internet gaming disorder show approach bias toward Internet gaming cues, and SRC reverse modification training can significantly correct this bias and therefore have therapeutic effects to some extent.

10.1159/000515625,Effectiveness of a guided web-based intervention to reduce depressive symptoms before outpatient psychotherapy: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Krämer, Lena Violetta;Grünzig, Sasha-Denise;Baumeister, Harald;Ebert, David Daniel;Bengel, Jürgen",Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics,,2020.3.31,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: Psychotherapy is a first-line treatment for depression. However, capacities are limited, leading to long waiting times for outpatient psychotherapy in health care systems. Web-based interventions (WBI) could help to bridge this treatment gap. Objective: This study investigates the effectiveness of a guided cognitive-behavioral WBI in depressive patients seeking face-to-face psychotherapy. Methods: A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted. Depressive patients ( n = 136) recruited from the waiting lists of outpatient clinics were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG; treatment as usual [TAU] + immediate access to WBI) or a control group (CG; TAU + access to WBI after follow-up). Depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 7 weeks, and 5 months after randomization. Results: Mixed-model analyses revealed a significant group × time interaction effect on depressive symptoms ( F 2, 121.5 = 3.91; p &lt; 0.05). Between-group effect sizes were d = 0.55 at 7 weeks and d = 0.52 at 5 months. The IG was superior regarding psychological symptoms and mental health quality of life but not on physical health quality of life, attitudes, motivation for psychotherapy, or subjective need and uptake of psychotherapy. Conclusions: Patients waiting for face-to-face psychotherapy can benefit from a WBI when compared to TAU. Despite the reduction of depressive symptoms in the IG, the uptake of subsequent psychotherapy was still high in both groups. The effects remained stable at the 5-month follow-up. However, this study could not determine the proportion of specific intervention effects vs. nonspecific effects, such as positive outcome expectations or attention. Future research should focus on the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of WBI before psychotherapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a mobile application, based on cognitive behavioral principles, in reducing body dissatisfaction and BDD/ED symptoms in female university students considered at high-risk of developing body image disorders (BIDs). Fifty university students at high-risk of developing BIDs (using self-report questionnaires assessing BIDs and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinical Version) were randomized in two groups: immediate-use App group (iApp group; n = 25) and delayed-use App group (dApp group; n = 25). The iApp group started using the app at baseline for 16 days (T0 to T1). The dApp group waited for 16 days before starting to use the app (T1 to T2). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 16 days from baseline (T1), and 32 days from baseline (T2). Repeated measure Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) showed a Group (iApp vs. dApp) × Time (T0 vs. T1) interaction on BDD symptoms indicating medium effect size (partial eta squared) reductions in the iApp group compared to dApp group at T1; post-intervention means for BDD symptoms were under the cut-off for extreme body dissatisfaction/BDD symptoms in both groups. Pertaining to ED symptoms, no significant Group × Time interaction was detected. Training 3 minutes a day for 16 days with a CBT-based mobile application may lead to reductions in some forms of body dissatisfaction, including BDD symptoms in female university students at high-risk of developing BIDs. On the other hand, effects of the intervention on ED symptoms seem more limited. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between patient engagement in an mHealth intervention and depressive symptoms using repeated measures of both patient engagement and patient outcomes at 4 time points. Methods: Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an mHealth intervention aimed at reducing depressive symptoms among people living with HIV and elevated depressive symptoms. We examined the association between patient engagement and depressive symptoms in the intervention group (n = 150) where participants received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course and physical activity promotion on their WeChat social media app. Depressive symptoms were repeatedly measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at baseline and 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Patient engagement was correspondingly measured by the completion rate, frequency of items completed, and time spent on the program at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were used to explore the relationship between patient engagement and depressive symptoms at multiple time points in the intervention. Results: The mean PHQ-9 scores were 10.2 (SD 4.5), 7.7 (SD 4.8), 6.5 (SD 4.7), and 6.7 (SD 4.1) at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months, respectively. The mean completion rates were 50.6% (SD 31.8%), 51.5% (SD 32.2%), and 50.8% (SD 33.7%) at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively; the average frequencies of items completed were 18.0 (SD 14.6), 32.6 (SD 24.8), and 47.5 (SD 37.2) at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively, and the mean times spent on the program were 32.7 (SD 66.7), 65.4 (SD 120.8), and 96.4 (SD 180.4) minutes at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively. LGCMs showed good model fit and indicated that a higher completion rate (β at 3 months = -2.184, P = .048) and a greater frequency of items completed (β at 3 months = -0.018, P = .04) were associated with fewer depressive symptoms at 3 months. Although not significant, similar trends were found in the abovementioned relationships at 1 and 2 months. There was no significant relationship between time spent on the program and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This study revealed a positive association between patient engagement and health outcomes at 3 months of an mHealth intervention using LGCMs and repeated measures data. The results underscore the importance of improving patient engagement in mHealth interventions to improve patient-centered health outcomes.

Two-thirds of TC survivors report unmet supportive care needs regarding issues such as fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), but many are reluctant/ unable to seek face-to-face help. This study prospectively assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an interactive web-based self-management intervention (e-TC 2.0) in reducing borderline/clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and/or FCR among TC survivors. Methods: TC survivors who had completed treatment were recruited to this single-arm phase I trial through clinicians and online advertisements. Consenting participants completed baseline questionnaires, had 12 weeks’ access to e-TC 2.0, then completed post-intervention questionnaires. Feasibility was determined by the proportion of e-TC 2.0 completed (website usage data). Acceptability was assessed with purpose-designed satisfaction measures. Preliminary efficacy was indicated by changes in anxiety/depression (HADS), distress (thermometer), and FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form). Results: Thirty-nine participants started the intervention; 48% completed the first module, but only 20% completed all modules. Mean participant age was 37.1 years; mean time since diagnosis was 3.6 years. Mean acceptability scores were &gt;8/10. Mean unmet needs, distress, FCR, anxiety, and depression levels decreased after the intervention, as did the proportion of participants above clinical cut-offs. Conclusions: e-TC 2.0 is the first web-based resource for TC survivors with borderline/clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and/or FCR. Although engagement with e-TC 2.0 was somewhat limited, website users reported high levels of satisfaction and reductions in psychological morbidity and unmet needs. e-TC 2.0 may be a useful adjunct to traditional face-to-face health professional support for TC survivors.

10.1007/s00127-019-01681-2,A pilot digital intervention targeting loneliness in young people with psychosis,"Lim, Michelle H.;Gleeson, John F. M.;Rodebaugh, Thomas L.;Eres, Robert;Long, Katrina M.;Casey, Kit;Abbott, Jo-Anne M.;Thomas, Neil;Penn, David L.",Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology: The International Journal for Research in Social and Genetic Epidemiology and Mental Health Services,,2018.11.22,Scholarly Journals,English,"Purpose: Loneliness has been identified as a significant challenge for people with psychosis. Interventions targeting loneliness are lacking but adopting a positive psychology approach may reduce loneliness, promote well-being, and support meaningful social interactions. Together with youth mental health consumers, we developed a digital smartphone application (app) called +Connect, which delivers positive psychology content daily for 6 weeks. Materials and methods: Twelve participants diagnosed with a psychotic disorder were recruited from early psychosis services. Loneliness was assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention. Acceptability, feasibility, and usability were measured post-intervention, including a semi-structured interview on the user’s experience of +Connect. Results: We found evidence for the feasibility of +Connect. All but two participants completed the +Connect program, completing 95% (40.10 out of 42 days) of the program. Furthermore, 66.67% (8 out of the 12 participants) remained engaged with the program 3-months post-intervention. Our data indicates preliminary evidence that +Connect may reduce loneliness, with scores from pre-intervention ( M = 50.00, SD = 8.47) to post-intervention ( M = 48.10, SD = 10.38) and 3-months post-intervention ( M = 42.89, SD = 7.04). We found that positive reinforcement of in-game rewards and evidence of positive mood changes added to the feasibility of the app. Regarding acceptability, while 10% (1/10 participants) reported not finding +Connect useful or enjoyable, 90% of participants agreed that +Connect helped them to increase their social confidence, enjoy life, look forward to being with other people, and feel more connected with others. Participant interviews supported these results, with participants highlighting the app’s strengths in providing useful information, stimulating self-reflection, fostering positive affect, and encouraging transfer of skills into their social interactions. Discussion: While preliminary findings indicated that +Connect yielded high levels of acceptability and feasibility, it is important to consider that we recruited a small and selected sample of lonely young people. Further iterations of this proof of concept app, which can incorporate participant feedback such preferences for increased personalisation, in-app feedback, and gamification, may allow an opportunity to test an improved version in the future.

Participants were randomized to ACT-DL (n = 27) or to active control (n = 28), with assessments completed at pre- and post-measurement and 6- and 12-months follow-up. It took up to five (ACT-DL) and 11 (control) months to start group-based interventions. Participants attended on average 4.32 out of 5 ACT-DL sessions. On the app, they filled in on average 69 (48%) of signal-contingent beep-questionnaires, agreed to 15 (41%) of offered beep-exercises, initiated 19 on-demand exercises, and rated ACT-DL metaphors moderately useful. Relative to active control, interviewer-rated depression scores decreased significantly in ACT-DL participants (p = .027). Decreases in self-reported depression, psychotic-related distress, anxiety, and general psychopathology did not differ between conditions. ACT-DL participants reported increased mean NA (p = .011), relative to active controls. Mean PA did not change in either group, nor did psychological flexibility. ACT-DL is a feasible intervention, although adaptations in future research may improve delivery of and compliance with the intervention.

The corrected tables are provided. The authors apologize for this error and any confusion that it may have caused.] Objective: Internet‐delivered interventions may alleviate distress in cancer survivors with limited access to psychological face‐to‐face treatment. In collaboration with a group of cancer survivors, we developed and tested the efficacy of a therapist‐assisted internet‐delivered mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (iMBCT) program for anxiety and depression in cancer survivors. Methods: A total of 1282 cancer survivors were screened for anxiety and depression during their routine oncology follow‐up; eligible breast (n = 137) and prostate cancer (n = 13) survivors were randomized to iMBCT or care‐as‐usual (CAU) wait‐list. Primary outcomes of anxiety and depression were assessed at baseline, 5 weeks, 10 weeks (post intervention), and 6 months. Results: Significant effects were found for both anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.45; P = .017) and depressive symptoms ( d = 0.42; P = .024) post intervention. The effects were maintained at follow‐up for anxiety ( d = 0.40; P = .029), but not for depressive symptoms ( d = 0.28; P = .131). Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest iMBCT to be a helpful intervention for cancer survivors suffering from symptoms of anxiety. Further studies on the efficacy for symptoms of depression are needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1017/bec.2019.10,Tailored text message prompts to increase therapy homework adherence: A single-case randomised controlled study,"Alfonsson, Sven;Englund, Joakim;Parling, Thomas",Behaviour Change,,2018.8.20,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Psychotherapy homework completion is associated with positive treatment outcomes, but many patients show low adherence to prescribed assignments. Whether text-message prompts are effective in increasing adherence to assignments is unknown. Aims: To evaluate whether tailored daily text-message prompts can increase homework adherence in a stress/anxiety treatment. Method: This study used a randomised controlled single-case alternating treatment design with parallel replication in seven participants. Participants received a five-week relaxation program for stress and anxiety with daily exercises. The intervention consisted of daily text messages tailored for each participant. Phases with or without text messages were randomly alternated over the study course. Randomisation tests were used to statistically analyse differences in mean number of completed relaxation exercises between phases. Results: There was a significant (combined p = .018) effect of daily text messages on homework adherence across participants with weak to medium effect size improvements. No negative effects of daily text messages were identified. Conclusions: Tailored text messages can marginally improve adherence to assignments for patients in CBT. Further studies may investigate how text messages can be made relevant for more patients and whether text messages can be used to increase homework quality rather than quantity.

We examined if a home-based computerized treatment program can feasibly be delivered and successfully treat GAD symptoms. Using a randomized control trial, we compared three active groups receiving computerized sequenced Attention Bias Modification (ABM) followed by Applied Relaxation psychoeducation (AR-pe), the reversed sequence of AR-pe and ABM, and a simultaneous ABM and AR-pe group to an assessment only control group. The participants comprised 169 adults with a diagnosis of GAD. We asked participants to complete as many as twenty-four 30-min sessions of an at-home computerized treatment program over 12 weeks. The control group received 24 brief assessment questionnaires as well as assessments of attention bias. Results from intent-to-treat analyses show faster rate of improvement for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) over time in groups that received active training in contrast to the clinical monitoring (CM) control group. Follow-up analyses revealed that both sequenced groups improved in anxiety when compared to the control group, while the simultaneous group did not outperform the control group. Results suggest that sequenced delivery of ABM and AR, may be a viable home-based treatment option for individuals with GAD who have limited access to resources or are otherwise unable to seek available treatments that require engagement outside of the home.

This randomized controlled trial compared a 5-week internet and app-based gratitude intervention (intervention group; IG) with adherence-focused guidance against a wait list control group (WLG) in reducing RNT in a sample with elevated RNT. Method: A total of 260 individuals were randomized to either the IG or the WLG. Data were collected at baseline (T1), within one week post intervention (T2), and at three (3-MFU) and six-months of follow-up (6-MFU; for IG only). The primary outcome was RNT. Secondary outcomes included other mental health outcomes and resilience factors. Results: Participants of the IG reported significantly less RNT at T2 ( d = 0.61) and 3-MFU ( d = 0.75) as compared to WLG. Improvements were sustained until 6-MFU. Significant, small to moderate effect sizes were identified for most secondary outcomes at T2 and 3-MFU. Furthermore, results of mediation analyses revealed that the gratitude intervention exerts its effect on anxiety and depression by reducing the risk factor of RNT, while the mediating role of resilience was less clear. Conclusions: The gratitude intervention investigated in this study was found to be effective in reducing RNT. Gratitude interventions might affect mental health by two parallel pathways: increasing resources and reducing risk factors.

The acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) matrix is a visual tool to help develop psychological flexibility by categorizing moment-to-moment experience and is well suited to a mobile app. This pilot study tested the effects of a simple and complex version of a novel app using the ACT matrix in two distinct samples: help-seeking individuals ( n = 35) and students receiving SONA credit ( n = 63). Findings indicated no differences between app conditions and a waitlist condition in the SONA credit sample. However, in the help-seeking sample, improvements were found on well-being and valued action in participants who used the app, with greater improvements and app adoption for those using a complex version with additional skills. A mobile app based on the ACT matrix has benefits for help-seeking individuals, but supplementary features may be necessary to support consistent use and benefits.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an app-assisted suicide prevention treatment on suicide risk and depression. One hundred twenty-nine participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU), consisting of psychotherapy adhering to the framework of Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), with (TAU+APP, N = 60) or without (TAU, N = 69) access to a mobile application (i.e., LifeApp’tite). Suicide risk and symptoms of depression were assessed pre- and posttherapy, and at 4-month follow-up. The TAU+APP group showed a smaller decrease on self-reported suicide risk at the end of treatment, corresponding to a medium between-group effect size ( p = .008, d = 0.46). At the 4-month follow-up this was the case only at the trend level, where the effect size was also of a smaller magnitude ( p = .057, d = 0.30). No differences between the treatment groups were observed on self-reported depressive symptoms, either immediately following treatment ( p = .732, d = 0.05) or at follow-up ( p = .467, d = 0.11). The unexpected negative effect concerning suicide risk points to crucial consideration of issues pertaining to timing, dosing, and content when adding new technology to existing treatments both in this and other populations.

Aim: This study explored the relationship between therapists’ individual techniques and patients’ symptoms of depression, cognitive errors, and coping. Of particular interest was the relative importance of techniques specific to CBT and those common to all therapies. Method: CBT therapy sessions of 43 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were analyzed using observer-rated measures: the Comprehensive Psychotherapeutic Interventions Rating Scale (CPIRS; Trijsburg et al., 2002) for therapist interventions, and the Cognitive Errors Rating Scale (CERS; Drapeau, Perry, &amp; Dunkley, 2008) and Coping Patterns Rating Scale (CPRS; Perry, Drapeau, &amp; Dunkley, 2005) for patients’ cognitive errors and coping strategies. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery, 1979) was used to assess symptoms of depression. Results: Results of hierarchical multiple regressions, controlling for pre-treatment depression scores and early cognitive errors and coping scores, showed the common factor intervention ‘rapport’ as the only intervention that significantly predicted improvement. Among CBT interventions, only the structuring intervention ‘scheduling and structuring activities’ emerged as a positive predictor of symptoms of depression. Discussion: These results provide further support for the importance of the therapeutic alliance in predicting depression outcome. While the lack of positive results on therapist CBT technique seem to cast doubt on their relative importance, it may also highlight the importance of measuring technique more contextually.

10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.01.008,A novel approach to challenging OCD related beliefs using a mobile-app: An exploratory study,"Roncero, María;Belloch, Amparo;Doron, Guy",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,2017.6.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and objectives: According to cognitive models, obsessive compulsive symptoms result from catastrophic misinterpretations of commonly occurring intrusive experiences and the use of counterproductive strategies to manage them. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) related beliefs such as inflated responsibility, importance of thoughts and perfectionism increases the likelihood of such misinterpretations. Consistent with a growing body of literature supporting the usefulness of mobile delivered technologies in fostering cognitive behavior change, the present study assessed the effectiveness of a novel cognitive training exercise designed to challenge OCD-related beliefs. This mobile app training exercise consists of users having to pull statements challenging OCD beliefs towards themselves (downwards) and to throw away (push upwards) contra-productive self-statements. Methods: 36 third-year BA students started the trial. Twenty completed pre and post measures of OCD-beliefs, mood and OCD symptoms including relationship-obsessions. Participants were instructed to complete 3 min of daily training for a period of 15 days. Results: No significant differences were found between completers and non-completers on demographic and most symptom related measures at Time 1. Repeated-measures MANOVA of the 20 completers showed a significant reduction on all OCD symptoms measures and on OCD-beliefs. No significant reduction was found in depression symptoms. Regression analysis showed change in levels of OCD-beliefs was associated with reduction in OCD symptoms at Time 2 over and above OCD symptoms at Time 1. Limitations: The study is an open trial with non-clinical participants. Conclusions: This mobile delivered training exercise may be useful for the reduction and relapse prevention of OCD-related beliefs and symptoms.

Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users’ everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL). Method: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self-report measures and diagnostic status of SAD. Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between-groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen’s d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up.

10.1186/s12888-018-1664-4,Cost-effectiveness of the mobile application TCApp combined with face-to-face CBT treatment compared to face-to-face CBT treatment alone for patients with an eating disorder: Study protocol of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,"Anastasiadou, Dimitra;Lupiañez-Villanueva, Francisco;Faulí, Clara;Cunillera, Jordina Arcal;Serrano-Troncoso, Eduardo",BMC Psychiatry,,2017.8.31,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The clinical utility of the existing apps for people with eating disorders (EDs) is not clear. The TCApp has been specifically developed for people with EDs, is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Treatment (CBT) and allows a bidirectional link between the patient and the therapist. The objectives of the study are, first, to assess the clinical efficacy of a combined intervention for Eating Disorders (EDs) that includes an online intervention through the TCApp plus standard face-to-face CBT in comparison to standard face-to-face CBT alone, and second, to examine the cost-effectiveness of the TCApp and identify potential predicting, moderating and mediating variables that promote or hinder the implementation of the TCApp in ED units in Spain. Methods: The study methodology is that of a randomised controlled trial combining qualitative and quantitative methods, with a 6-month follow-up. Approximately 250 patients over 12 years old with a diagnosis of an ED from several ED units in Spain will be randomised to one of two different conditions. Participants, their caregivers, healthcare professionals and technical staff involved in the development and maintenance of the application will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 6 months follow-up (T2). Primary outcome measures will include ED symptomatology while secondary measures will include general psychopathology and quality of life for patients, quality of life and caregiving experience for family caregivers and adoption-related variables for all participants involved, such as perceived usability, user’s satisfaction and technology acceptance. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, we will assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); total societal cost will be estimated using costs to patients and the health plan, and other related costs. Discussion: The study will provide an important advance in the treatment of EDs; in the long term, it is expected to improve the quality of patient care and the treatment efficacy and to reduce waiting lists as well as direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of EDs in Spain.

PAXPD study results,"Ciuca, Amalia M.;Berger, Thomas;Crişan, Liviu G.;Miclea, Mircea",Journal of Anxiety Disorders,,2017.7.12,Scholarly Journals,English,"A growing body of evidence suggests that Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (ICBT) are effective to treat anxiety disorders. However, the effect of therapist guidance in ICBT is still under debate and guided ICBT offered in a real-time audio-video communication format has not yet been systematically investigated. This three-arm RCT compared the efficacy of guided with unguided ICBT (12 weeks intervention) and a waitlist (WL). A total of 111 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder (PD) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Primary outcomes were the severity of self-report panic symptoms and diagnostic status. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression, functional impairment, catastrophic cognitions, fear of sensations and body vigilance. At post-treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcomes regarding PD and associated symptoms (guided ICBT vs. WL: d = 1.04–1.36; unguided ICBT vs. WL: d = 0.70–1.06). At post-treatment, the two active conditions did not differ significantly in self-reported symptom reduction ( d = 0.21–0.54, all p s &gt; 0.05), but the guided treatment was superior to the unguided treatment in terms of diagnostic status (χ² (1) = 13.15, p &lt; 0.01). Treatment gains were maintained at successive follow-ups and the guided treatment became superior to the unguided treatment at 6 months follow-up ( d = 0.72–1.05, all ps &lt; 0.05).

Smartphone applications (apps) are available anywhere, anytime, with the potential to both mitigate the impact of stigma and reduce PTSD symptom severity. We provided 144 SMs or family members, with subthreshold PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist [PCL] scores of 28–49), with apps promoting psychoeducation, social engagement, and relaxation and randomized them to 6 weeks of resilience enhancement (brief cognitive-behavioral session, followed by daily text messages directing app use) or a control group (daily text messages of inspirational quotes). Participants (54 percent males, 87 percent SMs) in both groups reported reductions in PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the 6-week intervention, which were sustained at 3 months, but exhibited partial rebound at 6–12 months.

One such treatment approach, attention bias modification training (ABMT), targets the anxiety-related threat bias, a disruption in attention to and neural processing of threat-related information. It remains unclear, however, whether reducing treatment barriers via mobile delivery of ABMT is effective and whether ABMT efficacy varies depending on individual differences in neural processing of threat. The present study tested whether mobile, gamified ABMT reduced prenatal threat bias, anxiety and stress, and whether ABMT efficacy varied with individual differences in neural responses to threat. Participants were 29 women in their 19th–29th week of pregnancy, randomized to four weeks of an ABMT or placebo training (PT) version of the mobile app using a double-blind design. Self-report of anxiety, depression, and stress were obtained; salivary cortisol was collected at home and in lab in response to stressors to index biological stress reactivity. Threat bias was measured using a computerized attention assay during which EEG was recorded to generate event-related potentials (ERPs) to threat cues. Results showed lower levels of lab cortisol following ABMT versus PT. Although the main effect of ABMT on subjective anxiety was not significant, the magnitude of cortisol reduction was correlated with lower levels of subjective anxiety and threat bias. Those receiving ABMT also reported less anxiety when showing smaller ERPs to threat (P1, P2) prior to training, but, conversely reported more anxiety when showing larger ERPs to threat. Use of gamified, mobile ABMT reduced biobehavioral indices of prenatal stress and anxiety, but effects on anxiety varied with individual differences in cortisol response and neurocognitive indices of early attention to threat.

Barr",Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,,2016.1.21,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in the population, but relatively few affected individuals receive treatment for it. Smartphone applications (apps) could help address this unmet need by offering sound psychoeducational information and evidence-based cognitive behavioral coping tools. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a free, publicly available smartphone app (PTSD Coach) for self-management of PTSD symptoms. Method: One hundred 20 participants who were an average of 39 years old, mostly women (69.2%) and White (66.7%), recruited primarily through online advertisements, were randomized to either a PTSD Coach (n = 62) or a waitlist condition (n = 58) for 3 months. Web-administered self-report measures of PTSD, PTSD symptom coping self-efficacy, depression, and psychosocial functioning were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months following treatment. Results: Following the intent-to-treat principle, repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that at posttreatment, PTSD Coach participants had significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms (p = .035), depression symptoms (p = .005), and psychosocial functioning (p = .007) than did waitlist participants; however, at posttreatment, there were no significant mean differences in outcomes between conditions. A greater proportion of PTSD Coach participants achieved clinically significant PTSD symptom improvement (p = .018) than waitlist participants. Conclusion: PTSD Coach use resulted in significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms and other outcomes relative to a waitlist condition. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, PTSD Coach may provide a wide-reaching, convenient public health intervention for individuals with PTSD symptoms who are not receiving care.

The primary goal was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using video teleconferencing (i.e., computer-based and iPhone 4 streaming technology), with a secondary goal of examining clinical outcomes of PE delivered via teleconferencing compared with treatment as usual (TAU) on PTSD and depressive/anxious symptom reduction. Rural veterans ( N = 27) were randomized to receive PE by computer teleconferencing at a Veterans Administration community clinic, PE by an iPhone issued for the duration of the study, or TAU provided by a referring clinician. To examine the research goals, we collected data on the number of referrals to the study, number of patients entering the study, and number completing psychotherapy and documented pragmatic and technical issues interfering with the ability to use teleconferencing to deliver PE; results are discussed. In addition, measures of symptom change examined clinical outcomes. Results indicated decreases in PTSD symptoms in veterans who completed PE therapy via teleconferencing; however, there was significantly more attrition in these groups than in the TAU group.

Recent reviews of problematic gaming suggest that treatment is best approached from a cognitive-behavioural perspective. However, relatively little research has examined the underlying cognitive factors that might be usefully targeted in an intervention. To address this gap, we present the findings of a study involving N = 485 adult regular video-game players (84% male, M age = 26 years) who completed a questionnaire about gaming activity, problematic gaming, and problematic cognitions. Gaming cognitions fell on four dimensions: (1) perfectionism, (2) cognitive salience, (3) regret, and (4) behavioural salience. All cognition subscales correlated moderately to highly with two different measures of problematic gaming ( r = .49–.76), as well as a measure of emotional distress (DASS-21; r = .25–.35). Large effect sizes ( d = .87–1.96) were found when comparing problematic and non-problematic gamers on all four cognition types. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence for cognitive differences between problematic and non-problematic video-game players, and to identify specific cognitions which could be practically addressed in clinical settings. The implications for the further development and refinement of clinical approaches to problematic gaming, including formulation, assessment, and intervention, are discussed.

Methods: For 3–6 months, 301 patients with diabetes received weekly IVR calls assessing health status and self-care and providing tailored pre-recorded self-management support messages. Patients could participate together with an informal caregiver who received suggestions on self-management support, and patients’ clinicians were notified automatically when patients reported significant problems. Results: Patients completed 84% of weekly calls, providing 5682 patient-weeks of data. Thirty-nine percent participated with an informal caregiver. Outcome analyses adjusted for study design factors and sociodemographics indicated significant pre–post improvement in medication adherence, physical functioning, depressive symptoms, and diabetes-related distress (all p values &lt;0.001). Analyses of self-management problems indicated that as the intervention proceeded, there were significant improvements in patients’ IVR-reported frequency of weekly medication adherence, SMBG performance, checking feet, and frequency of abnormal self-monitored blood glucose readings (all p values &lt;0.001). Conclusions: We conclude that the combined program of automated telemonitoring, clinician notification, and informal caregiver involvement was associated with consistent improvements in medication adherence, diabetes self-management behaviors, physical functioning, and psychological distress.

Recent findings: E-health encompasses many categories, including computerized self-help strategies, online psychotherapy, websites that provide information, social media approaches including Facebook, Internet forums for health discussions, personal blogs, and videogames. Multiple tools exist to assess and document symptoms, particularly mood charts. Although all of these approaches are popular, only online psychotherapy and videogames have actually been evaluated in studies to evaluate both validity and efficacy. The face validity of social communication strategies including social media and blogs is strong, with clear implications for stigma reduction and peer support. Informational websites continue to be primary sources of psychoeducation on mental disorders. Social media sites have widespread use by the public and a profusion of health discussions and tools, but without published research evaluation of efficacy. Summary: E-health strategies, particularly online psychotherapy and tools to document symptoms, are useful and likely effective. Social communication strategies show enormous popularity, but urgently require research evaluation for impact.

In the present study, we examined whether mental health self-efficacy (MHSE), a construct derived from Bandura’s Social Learning Theory (SLT), influenced symptom and functional outcomes of a new mobile phone and web-based psychotherapy intervention for people with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety and stress. Methods: STUDY I: Data from 49 people with symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or stress in the mild-to-moderate range were used to examine the reliability and construct validity of a new measure of MHSE, the Mental Health Self-efficacy Scale (MHSES). STUDY II: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a recently completed randomised controlled trial ( N = 720) to evaluate whether MHSE effected post-intervention outcomes, as measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), for people with symptoms in the mild-to-moderate range. Results: STUDY I: The data established that the MHSES comprised a unitary factor, with acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .89) and construct validity. STUDY II: The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in MHSE at post-intervention relative to the control conditions ( p’s &lt; = .000). MHSE mediated the effects of the intervention on anxiety and stress symptoms. Furthermore, people with low pre-treatment MHSE reported the greatest post-intervention gains in depression, anxiety and overall distress. No effects were found for MHSE on work and social functioning. Conclusion: Mental health self-efficacy influences symptom outcomes of a self-guided mobile phone and web-based psychotherapeutic intervention and may itself be a worthwhile target to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of online treatment programs.

This study employed a pre-post design with two follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. A 9-week web-based self-help ACT program, including individual goal setting prior to the intervention, and minimal contact motivational coaching, was provided to 30 family caregivers in the Netherlands. Linear mixed-effect models based on a complete-case analysis showed significant changes in depressive symptoms (mean difference: −3.34, d = −0.78). Significant and sustained improvements were observed in stress (mean difference: −6, d = −1.13) and anxiety (mean difference: −5.55, d = −1.38), both of which were clinically significant. Sense of competence increased (mean difference: 1.1, d = 0.45). ACT-specific measures, including psychological flexibility, engaged living, and inflexibility, also showed significant improvements with medium-to-large effect sizes. This online intervention demonstrated promising preliminary evidence of ACT’s potential efficacy on caregivers’ well-being, warranting further research in larger-scale controlled trials.

The research gap in mental health care and prevalence of issues in access to care services has led to a growing demand for treatment options. Digital health technologies exhibit the potential to supplement mental health clinics by facilitating accessible and affordable services. Here we develop and evaluate the effectiveness of My Friendly Mind, a web-based app, designed to increase awareness of depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while providing preliminary mental health screening. The objectives of this study were threefold. First to identify and analyze the factors influencing the intention to use the My Friendly Mind app. Second, to evaluate the app’s impact on users’ knowledge about depression and ADHD. Third, to capture users’ overall perception of the My Friendly Mind app. Seventy-Seven individuals with mental health problems participated in the study with the mean age of 24 years. Of all the participants 43 were males. Our findings indicate that perceived usefulness significantly influences both the intention to utilize the app and attitudes toward mental health improvement. A pre- and post-intervention analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in participants’ mental health knowledge. The semi-structured interviews revealed the app’s strengths and identified areas for improvement, with participants expressing a strong inclination to continue using the app, indicating its potential as a valuable resource for student mental health support. In conclusion, our app effectively increases users’ knowledge about- and familiarity with- depression and ADHD while providing a user-friendly platform for preliminary mental health screening. Future research should prioritize user-centered design, content depth, educational material integration, longitudinal engagement analysis, user feedback incorporation, and exploration of digital inequalities. Addressing these areas will contribute to the development of more effective and user-friendly mHealth applications, ultimately improving mental health outcomes.

The role of DT in eliciting craving has been studied extensively in substance use disorders and, more recently, in some behavioral addictions. The main aim of the current study was to test the mediating role of DT and craving in the association between psychological distress, boredom proneness, and problematic Smartphone use (PSU). Six hundred and forty-six participants (mean age = 27.57 ± 9.64; females = 74.8%) took part in the study and completed a battery of self-report measures. As evidenced by path analysis, psychological distress and boredom proneness were linked to PSU through (i) imaginal prefiguration and verbal perseveration components of DT’s serial mediation; and (ii) imaginal prefiguration and craving’s serial effect. The model accounted for 60% of PSU variance and showed good fit indices. The current findings highlight the role of DT, particularly the imaginal prefiguration, in craving for the Smartphone and provide evidence that DT is associated with PSU directly, supporting the distinction between DT and craving.

Most sexual assault survivors do not access early preventative interventions for such conditions. App-based interventions are a promising means to extend the reach of early interventions and thereby reduce risk of chronic PTSD and alcohol misuse. Method: This study was a pilot randomized clinical trial of an app-based early intervention with phone coaching (THRIVE) for survivors of past-10-week sexual assault (NCT#: NCT03703258). Intended active components of the THRIVE app are daily cognitive restructuring, daily activity scheduling, and as-needed relationally focused exercises, supported by coaching calls. Forty-one adult female survivors of recent sexual assault with elevated posttraumatic stress and drinking were randomized to intervention or control (symptom-monitoring app with phone coaching). Participants in both conditions were encouraged to use their respective app for 21 days and completed self-report symptom assessments at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. Results: At 3-month follow-up, the between-group effect size favored intervention for posttraumatic stress (d = −0.70), intoxication frequency (d = −0.62), and drinking hours per week (d = −0.39). More participants evidenced reliable change in intervention versus control for posttraumatic stress (OR = 2.67) and alcohol problems (OR = 3.05) at 3 months. Conclusions: The general direction of effects indicates that THRIVE, coupled with coaching, reduces risk for PTSD and alcohol outcomes beyond coached monitoring. These findings suggest that apps like THRIVE may provide an option for early intervention for sexual assault survivors.

Fitbit data from individuals with recurrent MDD were used to describe the longitudinal effects of sleep duration, quality, and regularity on subsequent depression relapse and severity. Methods: Data were collected as part of a longitudinal observational mobile Health (mHealth) cohort study in people with recurrent MDD. Participants wore a Fitbit device and completed regular outcome assessments via email for a median follow-up of 541 days. We used multivariable regression models to test the effects of sleep features on depression outcomes. We considered respondents with at least one assessment of relapse ( n = 218) or at least one assessment of depression severity ( n = 393). Results: Increased intra-individual variability in total sleep time, greater sleep fragmentation, lower sleep efficiency, and more variable sleep midpoints were associated with worse depression outcomes. Adjusted Population Attributable Fractions suggested that an intervention to increase sleep consistency in adults with MDD could reduce the population risk for depression relapse by up to 22 %. Limitations: Limitations include a potentially underpowered primary outcome due to the smaller number of relapses identified than expected. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a role for consumer-grade activity trackers in estimating relapse risk and depression severity in people with recurrent MDD. Variability in sleep duration and midpoint may be useful targets for stratified interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.2196/55302,Longitudinal assessment of seasonal impacts and depression associations on circadian rhythm using multimodal wearable sensing: Retrospective analysis,"Zhang, Yuezhou;Folarin, Amos A.;Sun, Shaoxiong;Cummins, Nicholas;Ranjan, Yatharth;Rashid, Zulqarnain;Stewart, Callum;Conde, Pauline;Sankesara, Heet;Laiou, Petroula;Matcham, Faith;White, Katie M.;Oetzmann, Carolin;Lamers, Femke;Siddi, Sara;Simblett, Sara;Vairavan, Srinivasan;Myin-Germeys, Inez;Mohr, David C.;Wykes, Til;Haro, Josep Maria;Annas, Peter;Penninx, Brenda W. J. H.;Narayan, Vaibhav A.;Hotopf, Matthew;Dobson, Richard J. B.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2023.12.8,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Previous mobile health (mHealth) studies have revealed significant links between depression and circadian rhythm features measured via wearables. However, the comprehensive impact of seasonal variations was not fully considered in these studies, potentially biasing interpretations in real-world settings. Objective: This study aims to explore the associations between depression severity and wearable-measured circadian rhythms while accounting for seasonal impacts. Methods: Data were sourced from a large longitudinal mHealth study, wherein participants’ depression severity was assessed biweekly using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and participants’ behaviors, including sleep, step count, and heart rate (HR), were tracked via Fitbit devices for up to 2 years. We extracted 12 circadian rhythm features from the 14-day Fitbit data preceding each PHQ-8 assessment, including cosinor variables, such as HR peak timing (HR acrophase), and nonparametric features, such as the onset of the most active continuous 10-hour period (M10 onset). To investigate the association between depression severity and circadian rhythms while also assessing the seasonal impacts, we used three nested linear mixed-effects models for each circadian rhythm feature: (1) incorporating the PHQ-8 score as an independent variable, (2) adding seasonality, and (3) adding an interaction term between season and the PHQ-8 score. Results: Analyzing 10,018 PHQ-8 records alongside Fitbit data from 543 participants (n = 414, 76.2% female; median age 48, IQR 32-58 years), we found that after adjusting for seasonal effects, higher PHQ-8 scores were associated with reduced daily steps (β = –93.61, P &lt; .001), increased sleep variability (β = 0.96, P &lt; .001), and delayed circadian rhythms (ie, sleep onset: β = 0.55, P = .001; sleep offset: β = 1.12, P &lt; .001; M10 onset: β = 0.73, P = .003; HR acrophase: β = 0.71, P = .001). Notably, the negative association with daily steps was more pronounced in spring (β of PHQ-8 × spring = –31.51, P = .002) and summer (β of PHQ-8 × summer = –42.61, P &lt; .001) compared with winter. Additionally, the significant correlation with delayed M10 onset was observed solely in summer (β of PHQ-8 × summer = 1.06, P = .008). Moreover, compared with winter, participants experienced a shorter sleep duration by 16.6 minutes, an increase in daily steps by 394.5, a delay in M10 onset by 20.5 minutes, and a delay in HR peak time by 67.9 minutes during summer. Conclusions: Our findings highlight significant seasonal influences on human circadian rhythms and their associations with depression, underscoring the importance of considering seasonal variations in mHealth research for real-world applications. This study also indicates the potential of wearable-measured circadian rhythms as digital biomarkers for depression.

Postpartum anxiety leads to significant problems in both mother and child, such as maternal depression, difficulty breastfeeding, interference with parent-infant bonding, and childhood anxiety. In the current study, we tested the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of an Internet-delivered postpartum anxiety and OCD prevention program, “Preventing Postpartum Onset Distress” (P-POD), in a sample of 15 pregnant women in their third trimester. Geared toward at-risk pregnant people, P-POD includes seven 30-minute educational, interactive modules that teach skills derived from cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety and OCD. P-POD also includes three additional modules for partners, with strategies for supporting their partners. Findings suggest that P-POD is acceptable and feasible. Participants experienced reductions in postpartum anxiety risk factors. However, this was a small, open-trial pilot study with a relatively homogeneous sample. Future research should compare P-POD to an active control condition, use more diverse samples, include qualitative interviews, and assess symptoms postpartum.

However, while theoretical models of emotion regulation would also implicate greater variability in daily affect in these conditions, empirical evidence linking EMA of mood variability with affective disorders is mixed. We used multilevel modeling to test relationships of daily mood and mood variability with depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms. Methods: Participants ( N = 1004; 72.31 % female; M age = 40.85) responded to EMA of mood 2-3×/day and completed measures of depression (PHQ-8), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), and social anxiety (SPIN) every three weeks. Results: Lower mean affect predicted all symptoms at both the between-person (PHQ-8: β = −0.486, p &lt; 0.001; GAD-7: β = −0.429, p &lt; 0.001; SPIN: β = −0.284, p &lt; 0.001) and within-person (PHQ-8: β = −0.219, p &lt; 0.001; GAD-7: β = −0.196, p &lt; 0.001; SPIN: β = −0.049, p &lt; 0.001) levels. Similarly, at the between-person level, greater affective variability was linked with all three clinical symptoms (PHQ-8: β = 0.617, p &lt; 0.001; GAD-7: β = 0.703, p &lt; 0.001; SPIN: β = 0.449, p &lt; 0.001). However, within-person, affective variability related to depression (β = 0.144, p &lt; 0.001) and generalized anxiety (β = 0.150, p &lt; 0.001), but not social anxiety (β = 0.006, p = 0.712).

Naturalistic data from self-guided DMHIs are often not available, hindering our ability to assess adherence among real-world users. This study aimed to analyze 3 years of user data from the public launch of an empirically supported 12-session self-guided DMHI, to assess overall program adherence rates and explore predictors of adherence. Data from 984 registered users were analyzed. Results showed that only 14.8% of users completed all 12 modules and 68.6% completed less than half of the modules. Users who were younger, had milder depression, had never seen a mental health provider, and who rejected signing-up for weekly program emails completed significantly more modules. Results add to concerns about the generalizability of controlled research on DMHIs due to lower adherence outside of research trials. This study highlights the potential of user data in identifying key factors that may be related to adherence. By examining adherence patterns among different sub-sets of users, we can pinpoint and focus on individuals who may adhere and benefit more from self-guided programs. Findings could also have implications for guiding intervention personalization for individuals who struggle to complete DMHIs.

Mindfulness interventions that utilize focused breathing, app-based guidance, and brief duration may present mental health benefits. However, examining individuals’ unique experiences from continued engagement in brief app-based mindfulness interventions over time, as well as identifying potential barriers preventing the use, is understudied. The current study utilized a longitudinal mixed method design to understand the experiences of individuals using a widely available app-based (i.e., Apple Watch) mindfulness breathing intervention over a 2-week period by identifying the thematic patterns common among the individuals and how this affected their levels of depression, anxiety, and coping skills over time. Qualitative analysis revealed a general positive experience among the participants, as well as the importance of personalization related to mindfulness interventions. Quantitative findings indicated a significant increase in coping skills, but no substantial change in their levels of depression or anxiety after 2 weeks. Researchers should continue examining interventions that include the core aspects of mindfulness, while exploring variations of mindfulness duration, frequency, total length, and breath rate to determine maximum efficacy. Practice-based interventions should focus on the effective ways to implement app-based self-guided mindfulness interventions, such as being short in duration, personalized for daily use, and aligning the practice with key components of mindfulness.

10.1017/S1754470X2300034X,British-Bangladeshi Muslim men: Removing barriers to mental health support and effectively supporting our community,"Alam, Shah",the Cognitive Behaviour Therapist,,2023.7.18,Scholarly Journals,English,"In England, Bangladeshi men are amongst the lowest number of people referred to primary care NHS Talking Therapies services and amongst the most likely to have deteriorated (NHS Digital, 2020). Factors related to culture, religion and gender influence stigma and help-seeking (Robinson et al., 2011). Furthermore, a lack of knowledge from services and professionals on cultural understandings of mental distress facilitate a failure to fully understand the needs of individual populations (Faheem, 2023). The aim of this research study was to qualitatively explore stigma and help-seeking for mental health difficulties, within British-Bangladeshi Muslim men in London. Recruitment consisted of men aged 22–59 years, experiencing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression but not accessing formal support. Ethical approval was obtained from Royal Holloway, University of London. After an online screening questionnaire, individual semi-structured video interviews were completed between May and October 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis presented six over-arching themes: ‘different understanding of mental health’, ‘traditional cultural expectations’, ‘fear and loss’, ‘coping resources’, ‘barriers to access’ and ‘community outreach and collaboration’. Many factors were highlighted as barriers accessing support, such as stigma and trust in services. Key practice implications are highlighted for services and practitioners. Professionals must understand the factors which impact the wellbeing of Bangladeshi men, how to better meet the needs of the community, and remove barriers to help. Participants also suggested initiatives to raise mental health awareness and reduce stigma, as an inclusive approach is needed with greater listening to communities and partnerships with local authorities. Key learning aims: (1) To better understand the needs of the population and factors which impact wellbeing. (2) To consider the muti-faceted barriers to access mental health support, such as CBT, and how to address these. (3) To unpack what stigma means (internally and externally) for men in the population. (4) How to support low- and high-intensity CBT practitioners to better work therapeutically to support Bangladeshi men.

Emotion regulation is a possible transdiagnostic mechanism of change that may promote and maintain some of the varied mental health problems related to trauma exposure. Aims: This study examines the feasibility and initial impact of two brief emotion regulation skill trainings targeting different processes hypothesized to reduce trauma-related problems, compared with an active control. Method: Subjects ( n = 156) were randomized to receive one of three brief internet-based trainings: (1) skill training on accepting emotions, (2) skill training on changing emotions, or (3) stress psychoeducation (control). Participants completed measures of emotion regulation, mindfulness, and affect intensity 24 hours pre- and immediately post-training. Results: Results suggested that a brief internet-based skills training programme was feasible and acceptable, with 91.9% completing the training programme to which they were randomized. Results showed that participants in all conditions demonstrated significant decreases in emotion regulation problems over time; yet these improvements did not vary by condition. Participants in the Change condition with higher PTSD symptoms were significantly more likely to have greater increases in positive affect compared with those with lower PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Although the three conditions did not show different outcomes, all three brief internet-delivered trainings were feasible. Results provide direction for future studies to evaluate the delivery of emotion regulation skills in individuals with trauma-related distress.

McCall et al. (see record 2023-94060-001). McCall et al. researched and concluded that ""Black American women, in general, have favorable views toward seeking mental health services and are comfortable with the use of mobile technology to receive support for managing depression."" Research like that of McCall et al. helps providers, policy makers, and patients better understand how patients may perceive the benefits and drawbacks of digital health tools. As McCall et al. acknowledge, their research may not necessarily be broadly applicable to other populations, and additional understanding of how digital therapeutics are perceived across income levels, geographic areas, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other demographic groups would be helpful. Ideally, digital health tools will complement broader efforts to promote equity in behavioral health screening, access, prevention, and treatment. With more digital tools arriving amid a shortage of behavioral health providers, digital tools have the potential, as during COVID-19, to help reach additional populations and support a busy and challenged provider workforce. Working together, we can ensure that post–COVID-19 digital approaches are grounded in an understanding of the needs, values, and perspectives of patients and behavioral health providers who will use and hopefully benefit from these additional tools.

B.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2022.12.21,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects millions of people worldwide, but timely treatment is not often received owing in part to inaccurate subjective recall and variability in the symptom course. Objective and frequent MDD monitoring can improve subjective recall and help to guide treatment selection. Attempts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to explore the relationship between the measures of depression and passive digital phenotypes (features) extracted from smartphones and wearables devices to remotely and continuously monitor changes in symptomatology. However, a number of challenges exist for the analysis of these data. These include maintaining participant engagement over extended time periods and therefore understanding what constitutes an acceptable threshold of missing data; distinguishing between the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships for different features to determine their utility in tracking within-individual longitudinal variation or screening individuals at high risk; and understanding the heterogeneity with which depression manifests itself in behavioral patterns quantified by the passive features. Objective: We aimed to address these 3 challenges to inform future work in stratified analyses. Methods: Using smartphone and wearable data collected from 479 participants with MDD, we extracted 21 features capturing mobility, sleep, and smartphone use. We investigated the impact of the number of days of available data on feature quality using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We then examined the nature of the correlation between the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression scale (measured every 14 days) and the features using the individual-mean correlation, repeated measures correlation, and linear mixed effects model. Furthermore, we stratified the participants based on their behavioral difference, quantified by the features, between periods of high (depression) and low (no depression) PHQ-8 scores using the Gaussian mixture model. Results: We demonstrated that at least 8 (range 2-12) days were needed for reliable calculation of most of the features in the 14-day time window. We observed that features such as sleep onset time correlated better with PHQ-8 scores cross-sectionally than longitudinally, whereas features such as wakefulness after sleep onset correlated well with PHQ-8 longitudinally but worse cross-sectionally. Finally, we found that participants could be separated into 3 distinct clusters according to their behavioral difference between periods of depression and periods of no depression. Conclusions: This work contributes to our understanding of how these mobile health–derived features are associated with depression symptom severity to inform future work in stratified analyses.

We examined the linguistic features of outgoing text messages among individuals with depression and their close- and non-close contacts. Methods: 419 participants were included in this 16-week-long observational study. Participants regularly completed the PHQ-8 and rated subjective closeness to their contacts. Text messages were processed to count frequencies of word usage in the LIWC 2015 libraries. A linear mixed modeling approach was used to estimate linguistic feature scores of outgoing text messages. Results: Regardless of closeness, people with higher PHQ-8 scores tended to use more differentiation words. When texting with close contacts, individuals with higher PHQ-8 scores used more first-person singular, filler, sexual, anger, and negative emotion words. When texting with non-close contacts these participants used more conjunctions, tentative, and sadness-related words and fewer first-person plural words. Conclusion: Word classes used in text messages, when combined with symptom severity and subjective social closeness data, may be indicative of underlying interpersonal processes. These data may hold promise as potential treatment targets to address interpersonal drivers of depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

F.",Clinical Psychologist,,2022.6.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: This study explored therapist perspectives on decision-making about uptake and engagement with online assessment and treatment for anxiety and depression among digital mental health service (DMHS) users. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 20 therapists from two Australian DMHSs were conducted; interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically using Framework Methods. Results: Analyses yielded three interrelated themes: 1) Interplay between users, the DMHS and broader mental health system; 2) Decision-making process and dynamics; and 3) Information and decision-support needs. Theme 1 highlighted the diversity of DMHS users, and how users’ interactions with third-party health professionals influence access/use, showing that DMHSs are not a standalone entity. Theme 2 revealed therapists’ key role within DMHSs, including how they shape users’ decision-making through managing expectations and deliberating on options and “treatment fit”. Theme 3 demonstrated considerable variability in how informed and knowledgeable users were when engaging with DMHSs, and how some users have decisional uncertainty and delay, and would benefit from additional decisional support. Conclusions: Findings provide in-depth therapist insights into what influences service user decision-making about using DMHS for assessment and treatment. These insights can inform user-centred design of DMHSs and highlight the need to better integrate DMHS into mainstream mental healthcare.

The present meta-analysis provides a comprehensive review of online ACT self-help interventions, characterizing the programs that have been studied (e.g. platform, length, content) and analyzing their efficacy. A transdiagnostic approach was taken, including studies that addressed a range of targeted problems and populations. Multi-level meta-analyses were used to nest multiple measures of a single construct within their respective studies. A total of 53 randomized controlled trials were included (n = 10,730). Online ACT produced significantly greater outcomes than waitlist controls at post-treatment for anxiety, depression, quality of life, psychological flexibility, and all assessed outcomes (i.e. omnibus effect), which were generally maintained at follow-up. However, only psychological flexibility and all assessed outcomes at post-treatment were found to be significantly greater for online ACT when compared to active controls, with no significant follow-up effects. Overall, these results further clarify that ACT can be effectively delivered in an online format to target a wide range of mental health concerns, although it is less clear if and when online ACT is more efficacious than other online interventions.

The study focuses on how the therapists experienced the process. Methods: Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured individual interviews with seven therapists from iPsych. The interviews were conducted using an interview guide with questions based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Quantitative data on the perceived level of normalization were collected from iPsych therapists, administrative staff, and off-site professionals in contact with the target demographic at 10-time points throughout the implementation. Results: The therapists experienced an improvement in the intake procedure. They reported having more relevant information about the patients to be used during the assessment and the treatment; they liked the new design better; there was a better alignment of expectations between patients and therapists; the patient group was generally a better fit for treatment after implementation; and more of the assessed patients were included in the program. The quantitative data support the interview data and describe a process of normalization that increases over time. Discussion: The ItFits-toolkit appears to have been an effective mediator of the implementation process. The therapists were aided in the process of change, resulting in an enhanced ability to target the patients who can benefit from the treatment program, less expenditure of time on the wrong population, and more satisfied therapists.

Significant Assessment Time × Treatment Condition interactions were observed on all outcomes, indicating that access to the treatment led to a decrease in posttraumatic stress (F[1,117.04] = 12.128, p = .001; d = .519, 95% CI = .142–.895), depression (F[1,118.29] = 9.978, p = .002; d = .519, 95% CI = .141–.898) insomnia (F[1,117.60] = 4.574, p = .035; d = .512, 95% CI = .132–.892), and anxiety (F[1,119.64] = 5.465, p = .021; d = .421, 95% CI = .044–.797) symptom severity and disability (F[1,111.55] = 7.015, p = .009; d = .582, 95% CI = .200–.963). Larger effect sizes ( d = 0.823–1.075) were observed in participants who completed at least half of the treatment. The RESILIENT online treatment platform was successful to provide access to specialized evidence-based mental health care after a disaster.

10.1037/ccp0000761,The timing and magnitude of symptom improvements during an Internet-delivered transdiagnostic treatment program for anxiety and depression,"Bisby, Madelyne A.;Scott, Amelia J.;Fisher, Alana;Gandy, Milena;Hathway, Taylor;Heriseanu, Andreea I.;Karin, Eyal;Cross, Shane;Staples, Lauren;Titov, Nickolai;Dear, Blake F.",Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,,2022.1.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: In face-to-face treatments, mental health symptoms improve rapidly across the first few treatment sessions, and the pace of improvement slows with additional sessions. Some individuals also report clinically meaningful symptom improvements after only two or three treatment sessions. As the rate of symptom change has been given limited attention within digital treatments, the present study investigated the timing and magnitude of symptom change during an 8-week online treatment for anxiety and depression. Method: Three adult samples were derived from previous randomized controlled trials: generalized anxiety disorder ( n = 165), major depression ( n = 149), and mixed anxiety/depression ( n = 262). Symptom scores were compared between consecutive weeks of treatment, and we examined the proportion of individuals who achieved a ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% improvement in symptoms each week. Results: Across all three samples, symptoms improved more rapidly during the first half of treatment compared to the second half of treatment. Within the first 4 weeks, over half of the participants had experienced a ≥ 25% improvement in symptoms, and approximately a third of participants had experienced a ≥ 50% improvement in symptoms. This pattern of change was found irrespective of diagnostic status or outcome measure. Conclusions: A substantial number of people who receive internet-delivered treatments appear to experience rapid, large, and clinically significant symptom improvement early in treatment. These findings add to our theoretical understanding of symptom improvements during psychotherapy, and further research investigating the mechanisms of such change will inform the development of more effective treatments.

We aimed to assess Mindful Moment’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability, and to gather preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in reducing parenting stress and outcomes such as mindful parenting, self-compassion, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, dispositional mindfulness, mother’s perception of infant temperament, and mother-infant bonding. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was a two-arm trial and followed the CONSORT 2010, CONSORT-EHEALTH, and CONSORT-SPI 2018 extension guidelines. A total of 292 Portuguese mothers were randomly assigned to the intervention group ( n = 146) or to the waiting list control group ( n = 146) and completed baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2) self-reported assessments. Results: A total of 31 mothers (21.23%) completed the Mindful Moment intervention. Most mothers evaluated the program as good or excellent (90%), considered that Mindful Moment provided them the kind of help they expected or wanted (61%), were satisfied with the help provided by the program (74.6%), would recommend it to a friend in a similar situation (86.4%), and would use it again if needed (81.4%). Regarding the program’s preliminary effectiveness, mothers in the intervention group presented a greater decrease in parenting stress, a greater increase in dispositional mindfulness, and a greater decrease in their perception of the difficult temperament of their infants from T1 to T2. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the Mindful Moment’s effectiveness and suggests that it is a feasible and acceptable program for postpartum mothers experiencing parenting stress. Further research is needed to confirm these results in a larger RCT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1002/da.23286,"Prospective associations of text‐message‐based sentiment with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety","Stamatis, Caitlin A.;Meyerhoff, Jonah;Liu, Tingting;Sherman, Garrick;Wang, Harry;Liu, Tony;Curtis, Brenda;Ungar, Lyle H.;Mohr, David C.",Depression and Anxiety,,2022.4.4,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: Language patterns may elucidate mechanisms of mental health conditions. To inform underlying theory and risk models, we evaluated prospective associations between in vivo text messaging language and differential symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. Methods: Over 16 weeks, we collected outgoing text messages from 335 adults. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), NRC Emotion Lexicon, and previously established depression and stress dictionaries, we evaluated the degree to which language features predict symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, or social anxiety the following week using hierarchical linear models. To isolate the specificity of language effects, we also controlled for the effects of the two other symptom types. Results: We found significant relationships of language features, including personal pronouns, negative emotion, cognitive and biological processes, and informal language, with common mental health conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety ( p s &lt; .05). There was substantial overlap between language features and the three mental health outcomes. However, after controlling for other symptoms in the models, depressive symptoms were uniquely negatively associated with language about anticipation, trust, social processes, and affiliation (βs: −.10 to −.09, p s &lt; .05), whereas generalized anxiety symptoms were positively linked with these same language features (βs: .12–.13, p s &lt; .001). Social anxiety symptoms were uniquely associated with anger, sexual language, and swearing (βs: .12–.13, p s &lt; .05). Conclusion: Language that confers both common (e.g., personal pronouns and negative emotion) and specific (e.g., affiliation, anticipation, trust, and anger) risk for affective disorders is perceptible in prior week text messages, holding promise for understanding cognitive‐behavioral mechanisms and tailoring digital interventions.

10.3389/fpsyg.2022.951451,Clinical EFT as an evidence-based practice for the treatment of psychological and physiological conditions: A systematic review,"Church, Dawson;Stapleton, Peta;Vasudevan, Anitha;O'Keefe, Tom",Frontiers in Psychology,,2022.5.24,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Since the turn of the century, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) has come into widespread use in medical and psychological treatment settings. It is also used as self-help by tens of millions of people each year. Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an “evidence-based” practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure. Objectives: In 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research. It has been viewed or downloaded over 36,000 times, indicating widespread interest in this treatment modality. Here we update our findings based on subsequently published literature and propose directions for future research. Method: We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses. Results: RCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be “moderate” to “large.” Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy. Conclusions: Subsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies. These find Clinical EFT to be efficacious for a range of psychological and physiological conditions. Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow.

A review of popular apps for depression, anxiety, and well-being","Wasil, Akash R.;Palermo, Emma H.;Lorenzo-Luaces, Lorenzo;DeRubeis, Robert J.",Cognitive and Behavioral Practice,,2021.3.4,Scholarly Journals,English,"Smartphone apps for mental health (MH apps) and wellness reach millions of people and have the potential to reduce the public health burden of common mental health problems. Thousands of MH apps are currently available, but real-world consumers generally gravitate toward a very small number of them. Given their widespread use and the lack of empirical data on their effects, understanding the content within MH apps is an important public health priority. An overview of the content within these apps could be an important resource for users, clinicians, researchers, and experts in digital health. Here, we offer summaries of the content within highly popular MH apps. Our aim is not to provide comprehensive coverage of the MH app space. Rather, we sought to describe a small number of highly popular MH apps in three common categories: meditation and mindfulness, journaling and self-monitoring, and AI chatbots. We downloaded the two most popular apps in each of these categories (respectively: Calm, Headspace; Reflectly, Daylio; Replika, Wysa). These six apps accounted for 83% of monthly active users of MH apps. For each app, we summarize information in four domains: intervention content, features that may contribute to engagement, the app’s target audience, and differences between the app’s free version and its premium version. In the years ahead, rigorous evaluations of highly popular MH apps will be needed. Until then, we hope that this overview helps readers stay up-to-date on the content within some of the most widely used digital mental health interventions.

Effective treatments exist, but they are time- and resource-intensive. This study tested the initial efficacy and acceptability of a novel treatment protocol designed to increase efficiency: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) taught in groups and through an adjunctive mobile app. Participants were 21 individuals with GAD who received six weeks of 2-hour group ACT sessions as well as access to an adjunctive ACT mobile app. Significant improvements occurred in worry, anxiety, social functioning, and depression as well as relevant processes (psychological inflexibility, anxiety-related cognitive fusion). In-the-moment improvements were also observed in symptoms and ACT processes immediately after completing mobile app sessions. Treatment was perceived as credible and acceptable overall. However, rates of reliable and clinically significant change were low, and app usage did not correlate with change in worry. Overall, this study suggests that an efficient, brief ACT group intervention combined with a mobile app may lead to improvements in GAD but may not be sufficient for clinically significant change. A detailed overview of the treatment is included, and guidance for clinicians interested in implementing this protocol is discussed.

Methods: We conducted an online survey. A total of 1,395 patients completed the questionnaire at baseline. Insomnia, anxiety and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment (GAD-7) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. A total of 488 patients completed at least two surveys (baseline and monthly surveys thereafter) and reported that the online CBT was effective at the 1-year follow-up. The 488 patients were divided into three groups: the rapid (treatment effective at 4 weeks), intermediate (4–16 weeks), and delayed-response group (over 16 weeks). Results: Analysis of the demographic characteristics of the 488 patients did not reveal significant sex differences among the three groups ( P = 0.111). However, the groups significantly differed in age ( P = 0.001) and education ( P = 0.006). Compared to the rapid response group, the delayed-response group had a higher mean age ( P &lt; 0.01) and a slightly lower level of education. The duration of the disorder was longer in the delayed-response group. Multivariate logistic regression showed that male sex, junior high school education, and higher PSQI were independent risk factors for the delayed response to treatment. Conclusion: Many factors affected the efficiency of insomnia treatment. Male sex, junior school education, and a high PSQI score predicted delayed response to insomnia treatment.

Undergraduates ( N = 239; M age = 18.96, SD age = 1.10; 54.8% female) completed a self-report battery assessing PSU, transdiagnostic factors, demographic variables, and depression and anxiety. PSU was regressed on the nine factors controlling for gender, depression, and anxiety, and relative weights were calculated. Together, the model accounted for 42% of the total variance in PSU, with fear of missing out and psychological inflexibility explaining 47% of that total variance. Findings are discussed broadly in terms of PSU research and intervention development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Smartphones have the potential to overcome geographical and linguistic barriers to mental health assessment and intervention. The purpose of the current study was to examine (a) the feasibility/acceptability of smartphone‐based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to assess suicide ideation and suicide risk factors among high‐risk Spanish‐speaking adults and (b) the degree of within‐person variation of suicide ideation and suicide risk in this population. Method: Sixteen primary Spanish‐speaking psychiatry outpatients completed EMA measures of suicide ideation and suicide risk factors four times a day for 14 days. Results: A majority of participants consented to active and passive remote assessments and reported the acceptability of study procedures. Adherence to EMA was high and not associated with symptom severity. EMA instances completed were not associated with symptom severity at follow‐up. Average point‐to‐point variability in suicide ideation and risk factors were moderate to high, respectively. EMA captured more dramatic changes than standard baseline and follow‐up assessments. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary support for the feasibility and acceptability of using smartphones to assess suicide risk in a real‐time and real‐world setting among high‐risk Spanish‐speaking adults.

In the original article, the author affiliations were published incorrectly. Cathy Creswell should have an additional affiliation of the University of Reading. The correct affiliations are given in the erratum. The affiliation appears correctly in this record. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2022-60228-001). Background: Online treatments for child anxiety offer a potentially cost-effective and non-stigmatizing means to widen access to evidence-based treatments and meet the increasing demand on services; however, uptake in routine clinical practice remains a challenge. This study conducted an initial evaluation of the clinical effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of OSI (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) within clinical practice. OSI is a co-designed online therapist-supported, parent-led CBT treatment for pre-adolescent children with anxiety problems. Method: This case series was part of routine service evaluation in a clinic in England where families were offered OSI to treat a primary anxiety difficulty among 7- to 12-year-old children; 24 families were offered OSI, and 23 took it up. Measures of anxiety symptomatology, functional impairment and progress towards therapeutic goals were taken at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 4-week follow-up. Treatment satisfaction and engagement were also measured throughout the intervention. Results: Mean anxiety symptoms significantly improved to below the clinical cut-off post-treatment, with further reduction at follow-up. Functional impairment also significantly improved and significant progress was made towards treatment goals. The majority of children showed reliable change in anxiety symptoms and reliable recovery by follow-up, and were discharged without needing further treatment for anxiety. Uptake, adherence and engagement in OSI were excellent, and parents reported high levels of satisfaction with the treatment. Conclusions: We have provided initial evidence that OSI is feasible, acceptable to families, and appears to be associated with good outcomes within routine clinical practice.

10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114633,Effectiveness of multimodal psychotherapeutic intervention for internet gaming disorder,"Sharma, Manoj Kumar;Anand, Nitin;Tadpatrikar, Ashwini;Marimuthu, Palaniappan;Narayanan, Gitanjali",Psychiatry Research,,2021.5.8,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Large number of studies on Internet gaming disorder (IGD) have primarily focused on ascertaining its psychological correlates. Few studies have focused on developing and assessing effectiveness of multimodal psychotherapeutic intervention programs. This intervention focused on minimizing salience, pre-occupation, conflict related to gaming and enhancing the overall quality of life, inclusive of psychological health, physical health, and environmental problems in individuals with IGD. At present, there appear to be no such studies in the Indian context. Methods: In this study, we developed and assessed the effectiveness of an intervention manual for IGD. The intervention program consisted of ten 60-minutes sessions with one therapist administering sessions once in each week. The interventions included motivational enhancement strategies, cognitive restructuring, behavioral strategies and relapse prevention. The outcomes from intervention were measured in terms of improvement in IGD, IAT, and overall quality of life. Our assessments, both at baseline and post-intervention consisted of Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGD-20) and the Whoqol-Bref. A total sample of 40 was selected out of which 33 individuals completed the 10 sessions of multimodal psychotherapy program and post assessments. Results: A total of 40 participants (age: M = 20.25, SD = 5.39) enrolled, out of which 33 completed the entire intervention program of 10 sessions and showed significant improvements. The IAT and IGD-20 showed significant difference in the scores for before treatment (M = 52.88, SD = 16.25) and after treatment (M = 42.87, SD = 11.31; t (32) = 5.10, p = 0.000) conditions; and right before treatment (M = 56.88, SD = 19.25) and after treatment (M = 47.87, SD = 15.31; t (32) = 6.94, p = 0.000) conditions respectively. The internet addiction and internet gaming disorder scores showed a similar degree of severity reductions on the IAT and IGD-20 respectively at the end of week 8. In addition, the participants showed significant improvements in the quality of life inclusive of physical and psychological health post the completion of intervention program. Limitations: The sample size of the study was small and assessments for evaluation of other psychological symptoms like depression, anxiety could have been conducted. Conclusion: The intervention program indicated a substantial change in the IGD scores at post- assessment. A study on a larger sample to assess the validity of the manualized multimodal psychotherapy program for IGD needs to be conducted. In addition, this manualized intervention program can be useful for administering structured intervention for IGD by mental health professionals working in the area of internet gaming disorder.

This study describes the development of and reactions to a low-intensity coaching protocol administered to N = 282 anxious adults identified as high risk to drop out of a web-based cognitive bias modification for interpretation intervention. Undergraduate research assistants were trained as coaches and communicated with participants via phone calls and synchronous text messaging. About half of the sample never responded to coaches’ attempts to schedule an initial phone call or did not answer the call, though about 30% completed the full intervention with their coach. Some anxious adults may choose technology-delivered interventions specifically for their lack of human contact and may fear talking to strangers on the phone; future recommendations include taking a more intensive user-centered design approach to creating and implementing a coaching protocol, allowing coaching support to be optional, and providing users with more information about how and why the intervention works.

B.",JMIR Mental Health,,2021.11.11,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The mobility of an individual measured by phone-collected location data has been found to be associated with depression; however, the longitudinal relationships (the temporal direction of relationships) between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility have yet to be fully explored. Objective: We aimed to explore the relationships and the direction of the relationships between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility over time. Methods: Data used in this paper came from a major EU program, called the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse–Major Depressive Disorder, which was conducted in 3 European countries. Depressive symptom severity was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) through mobile phones every 2 weeks. Participants’ location data were recorded by GPS and network sensors in mobile phones every 10 minutes, and 11 mobility features were extracted from location data for the 2 weeks prior to the PHQ-8 assessment. Dynamic structural equation modeling was used to explore the longitudinal relationships between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility. Results: This study included 2341 PHQ-8 records and corresponding phone-collected location data from 290 participants (age: median 50.0 IQR 34.0, 59.0) years; of whom 215 (74.1%) were female, and 149 (51.4%) were employed. Significant negative correlations were found between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility, and these correlations were more significant at the within-individual level than the between-individual level. For the direction of relationships over time, Homestay (time at home) (φ = 0.09, P = .01), Location Entropy (time distribution on different locations) (φ = −0.04, P = .02), and Residential Location Count (reflecting traveling) (φ = 0.05, P = .02) were significantly correlated with the subsequent changes in the PHQ-8 score, while changes in the PHQ-8 score significantly affected (φ = −0.07, P &lt; .001) the subsequent periodicity of mobility. Conclusions: Several phone-derived mobility features have the potential to predict future depression, which may provide support for future clinical applications, relapse prevention, and remote mental health monitoring practices in real-world settings.

10.1017/S0033291721004621,Impact of guidance on intervention adherence in computerised interventions for mental health problems: A meta-analysis,"Musiat, Peter;Johnson, Catherine;Atkinson, Melissa;Wilksch, Simon;Wade, Tracey",Psychological Medicine,,2021.6.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Web-based interventions are increasingly used for the prevention, treatment and aftercare of mental disorders. A crucial factor to the efficacy of such online programmes is adherence to the intervention content and procedure. It has been frequently suggested that adherence in web-based interventions is low and little is known about which factors influence adherence. To increase intervention uptake and completion, studies increasingly include interventions with some form of guidance. Guided interventions have been shown to have higher efficacy, however, evidence for the impact on adherence is limited and mixed. This meta-analysis explored the impact of human guidance on intervention completion in web-based mental health interventions. A total of 22 studies were included with interventions primarily targeting symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Results showed that guidance significantly increases the average amount of intervention completion [g = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18–0.40] and the proportion of intervention completers [ log odds ratio (OR) = 0.50, 95% CI 0.34–0.66] with small effects. On average, full completion rates were 12% higher in guided intervention groups. This meta-analysis demonstrated that guidance in web-based mental health interventions does increase adherence, but more research is required to better understand the specific mechanisms between guidance, adherence and outcomes.

B.;Narayan, Viabhav A.;Hotopf, Mathew",BMC Psychiatry,,2021.3.20,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a clinical illness Covid-19, has had a major impact on mental health globally. Those diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) may be negatively impacted by the global pandemic due to social isolation, feelings of loneliness or lack of access to care. This study seeks to assess the impact of the 1st lockdown—pre-, during and post—in adults with a recent history of MDD across multiple centres. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of an on-going cohort study, RADAR-MDD project, a multi-centre study examining the use of remote measurement technology (RMT) in monitoring MDD. Self-reported questionnaire and passive data streams were analysed from participants who had joined the project prior to 1st December 2019 and had completed Patient Health and Self-esteem Questionnaires during the pandemic ( n = 252). We used mixed models for repeated measures to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and sleep duration. Results: In our sample of 252 participants, 48% ( n = 121) had clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly before the pandemic. For the sample as a whole, we found no evidence that depressive symptoms or self-esteem changed between pre-, during- and post-lockdown. However, we found evidence that mean sleep duration (in minutes) decreased significantly between during- and post- lockdown (−12.16; 95% CI −18.39 to −5.92; p &lt; 0.001). We also found that those experiencing clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly before the pandemic showed a decrease in depressive symptoms, self-esteem and sleep duration between pre- and during- lockdown (interaction p = 0.047, p = 0.045 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) as compared to those who were not. Conclusions: We identified changes in depressive symptoms and sleep duration over the course of lockdown, some of which varied according to whether participants were experiencing clinically relevant depressive symptoms shortly prior to the pandemic. However, the results of this study suggest that those with MDD do not experience a significant worsening in symptoms during the first months of the Covid −19 pandemic.

Networked sensors embedded in smartphones can measure some behaviors objectively and continuously, with no ongoing effort. Objective: This study aims to evaluate whether changes in phone sensor–derived behavioral features were associated with subsequent changes in mental health symptoms. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study examined continuously collected phone sensor data and symptom severity data, collected every 3 weeks, over 16 weeks. The participants were recruited through national research registries. Primary outcomes included depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale), and social anxiety (Social Phobia Inventory) severity. Participants were adults who owned Android smartphones. Participants clustered into 4 groups: multiple comorbidities, depression and generalized anxiety, depression and social anxiety, and minimal symptoms. Results: A total of 282 participants were aged 19-69 years (mean 38.9, SD 11.9 years), and the majority were female (223/282, 79.1%) and White participants (226/282, 80.1%). Among the multiple comorbidities group, depression changes were preceded by changes in GPS features ( Time : r = −0.23, P = .02; Locations : r = −0.36, P &lt; .001), exercise duration ( r = 0.39; P = .03) and use of active apps ( r = −0.31; P &lt; .001). Among the depression and anxiety groups, changes in depression were preceded by changes in GPS features for Locations ( r = −0.20; P=.03) and Transitions ( r = −0.21; P = .03). Depression changes were not related to subsequent sensor-derived features. The minimal symptoms group showed no significant relationships. There were no associations between sensor-based features and anxiety and minimal associations between sensor-based features and social anxiety. Conclusions: Changes in sensor-derived behavioral features are associated with subsequent depression changes, but not vice versa, suggesting a directional relationship in which changes in sensed behaviors are associated with subsequent changes in symptoms.

Alongside a randomized, controlled trial with an active control condition, data on NEs were collected from 347 participants. An adapted version of the Inventory of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy yielded higher rates of participants experiencing at least one NE (30% intervention, 30.7% control) than the more common analysis of reliable deterioration rates (3.7% intervention, 6.2% control). Although patients reported to feel “not taken seriously,” pressured by the intervention’s schedule, or frustrated about the occurrence of technical problems, our results indicate that NEs in a web-based intervention were not more common than those reported for face-to-face psychotherapy.

The present trial was the first to investigate the effect of smartphone- based monitoring on the rate and duration of readmissions in BD. Methods: This was a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group trial. Patients with BD (ICD-10) discharged from hospitalization in the Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark were randomized 1:1 to daily smartphone-based monitoring including a feedback loop (+ standard treatment) or to standard treatment for 6 months. Primary outcomes: the rate and duration of psychiatric readmissions. Results: We included 98 patients with BD. In ITT analyses, there was no statistically significant difference in rates (hazard rate: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.54; 1.91, p = 0.88) or duration of readmission between the two groups (B: 3.67, 95% CI: −4.77; 12.11, p = 0.39). There was no difference in scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (B = −0.11, 95% CI: −2.50; 2.29, p = 0.93). The intervention group had higher scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale (B: 1.89, 95% CI: 0.0078; 3.78, p = 0.050). The intervention group reported lower levels of perceived stress (B: -7.18, 95% CI: −13.50; −0.86, p = 0.026) and lower levels of rumination (B: −6.09, 95% CI: −11.19; −1.00, p = 0.019). Conclusions: Smartphone-based monitoring did not reduce rate and duration of readmissions. There was no difference in levels of depressive symptoms. The intervention group had higher levels of manic symptoms, but lower perceived stress and rumination compared with the control group.

10.1002/da.23115,The effectiveness of internet‐delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: An updated systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Eilert, Nora;Enrique, Angel;Wogan, Rebecca;Mooney, Olwyn;Timulak, Ladislav;Richards, Derek",Depression and Anxiety,,2020.8.14,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent, chronic disorder associated with impaired quality of life, societal burden, and poor treatment rates. Internet‐delivered interventions may improve the accessibility of treatments and are increasingly being used. This study aimed to update a previous meta‐analysis to determine the effectiveness of available Internet‐delivered interventions in treating symptoms of GAD. Method: Systematic literature searches were conducted (through April 2020) using Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane to find randomized controlled trials of Internet‐delivered interventions for GAD. Risk of bias was evaluated, and Hedge's g was calculated at posttreatment and follow‐up. Results: Twenty studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta‐analysis. Random‐effect models detected large effect sizes for primary outcomes of anxiety ( g = 0.79) and worry ( g = 0.75), favoring treatment. Effect sizes for depression, functional impairment, and quality of life were moderate to large. Maintenance of effects at follow‐up seems likely. Conclusions: Results support the effectiveness of Internet‐delivered treatments for GAD. Considerable heterogeneity between studies appeared moderated by variability in the interventions themselves, highlighting the importance of further investigation into the characteristics that may optimize treatment outcomes. Overall, Internet‐delivery appears to be a viable mode of treatment for GAD with potential to relieve existing gaps in the provision of treatment.

Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods. Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24–68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study. Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = −0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression. Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.

10.3389/fpsyt.2020.599141,Altered reward processing system in internet gaming disorder,"Raiha, Syeda;Yang, Guochun;Wang, Lingxiao;Dai, Weine;Wu, Haiyan;Meng, Guangteng;Zhong, Bowei;Liu, Xun",Frontiers in Psychiatry,,2020.8.26,Scholarly Journals,English,"Converging evidence indicates that addiction involves impairment in reward processing systems. However, the patterns of dysfunction in different stages of reward processing in internet gaming addiction remain unclear. In previous studies, individuals with internet gaming disorder were found to be impulsive and risk taking, but there is no general consensus on the relation between impulsivity and risk-taking tendencies in these individuals. The current study explored behavioral and electrophysiological responses associated with different stages of reward processing among individuals with internet gaming disorders (IGDs) with a delayed discounting task and simple gambling tasks. Compared to the healthy control (HC) group, the IGD group discounted delays more steeply and made more risky choices, irrespective of the outcome. As for the event-related potential (ERP) results, during the reward anticipation stage, IGDs had the same stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) for both large and small choices, whereas HCs exhibited a higher SPN in large vs. small choices. During the outcome evaluation stage, IGDs exhibited a blunted feedback-related negativity for losses vs. gains. The results indicate impairment across different stages of reward processing among IGDs. Moreover, we found negative correlation between impulsivity indexed by BIS-11 and reward sensitivity indexed by SPN amplitude during anticipation stage only, indicating different neural mechanisms at different stages of reward processing. The current study helps to elucidate the behavioral and neural mechanisms of reward processing in internet gaming addiction.

Primary care is the de facto site for treating these mental health problems but is typically underresourced to meet the burden of these demands. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a mobile intervention platform, IntelliCare, for addressing depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two-arm randomized clinical trial at internal medicine clinics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Adult primary care patients (N = 146) who screened positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ; score ≥ 10) or anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; score ≥ 8) were recruited between July 17, 2018, and December 14, 2018. Interventions: The coach-supported platform composed of a suite of apps, was delivered over 8 weeks.Wait list control participants received treatment as usual for 8 weeks, then the mobile platform. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomeswere changes in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) during the intervention period. Secondary outcomes were differences in the proportion of patients who achieved recovery (PHQ-9/GAD-7 &lt; 5 or 50% improvement from baseline), sustainment of intervention effects during 2-month follow-up, and app use during the intervention period. Results: One hundred forty-six patients were included (119 of 146 were women [81.5%]; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [13.8] years). Of the 146 patients, 122 (83.6%) were diagnosed as having depression and 131 (89.7%) were diagnosed as having anxiety. A greater proportion of intervention vs wait list control participants achieved recovery from depression (n = 38 of 64 [59%] vs n = 18 of 58 [31%]; odds ratio, 3.25; 95%CI, 1.54-6.86) and anxiety (n = 37 of 65 [57%] vs n = 25 of 66 [38%]; odds ratio, 2.17; 95%CI, 1.08-4.36). Sustained effects were observed for depression (slope, 0.01; 95%CI, –0.09 to 0.10; P = .92) and anxiety scores (slope, 0.02; 95%CI, –0.08 to 0.12; P = .67) during follow-up. App use was high, with a median of 93 and 98 sessions among participants with depression and anxiety, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this trial, a mobile intervention app was effective for depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Findings also support designing digital mental health interventions as platforms containing simple, brief apps that can be bundled by users to meet their needs.

Casey;Kaiser, Susan M.;Alam, Nameyeh;Berhane, Helom;Kalan, Ozan;Mohr, David C.",Translational Behavioral Medicine,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Implementing a digital mental health service in primary care requires integration into clinic workflow. However, without adequate attention to service design, including designing referral pathways to identify and engage patients, implementation will fail. This article reports results from our efforts designing referral pathways for a randomized clinical trial evaluating a digital service for depression and anxiety delivered through primary care clinics. We utilized three referral pathways: direct to consumer (e.g., digital and print media, registry emails), provider referral (i.e., electronic health record [EHR] order and provider recommendation), and other approaches (e.g., presentations, word of mouth). Over the 5-month enrollment, 313 individuals completed the screen and reported how they learned about the study. Penetration was 13%, and direct to consumer techniques, most commonly email, had the highest yield. Providers only referred 16 patients through the EHR, half of whom initiated the screen. There were no differences in referral pathway based on participants’ age, depression severity, or anxiety severity at screening. Ongoing discussions with providers revealed that the technologic implementation and workflow design may not have been optimal to fully affect the EHR-based referral process, which potentially limited patient access. Results highlight the importance of designing and evaluating referral pathways within service implementation, which is important for guiding the implementation of digital services into practice. Doing so can ensure that sustained implementation is not left to post-evaluation bridge-building. Future efforts should assess these and other referral pathways implemented in clinical practice outside of a research trial.

Mobile technology may help bypass barriers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of screening and texting perinatal women via their personal smartphones. This prospective cohort study enrolled 203 pregnant and postpartum women receiving obstetric care at a Midwestern US academic medical center. Participants received one electronic mood screen and three text messages per week for two weeks. Texts were based on the Mothers and Babies Course, a CBT-based preventative program that addresses limited social support, lack of pleasant activities, and harmful thought patterns. Feasibility was defined as the ability to take the mood screen and receive texts without technical difficulties. Demographic variables were paired with results. Insurance type (private or public) was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Pearson chi-squared tests were used to analyze the data. A text-based satisfaction survey was also administered. The sample was 72% privately insured and 28% publicly insured. Sixty-seven percent completed electronic screening. Screen completion was significantly associated with private insurance (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 2.00–7.30) and “married” status (OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.01–3.70). Most survey respondents (92%) found it easy to receive the texts, and 76% responded with very favorable comments about the texts.

Evidence-based treatment options are, however, scarce due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet- and mobile-based interventions may be an effective means to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUD as they address individuals affected in their online setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed, guided internet- and mobile-based intervention for IUD. Methods: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial ( N = 130), individuals showing problematic internet use patterns (Internet Addiction Test ≥ 49) will be randomly allocated to the internet- and mobile-based intervention or a waiting control group. Assessments will take place at baseline, 7 weeks, 6- and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is internet addiction symptom severity (IAT) at 7 weeks. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other psychosocial variables associated with IUD. Intervention: The intervention consists of seven sessions: Goal setting and motivational interviewing, impulse control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, self-worth, relapse prevention, and a booster session. Participants are supported by an eCoach who provides individual feedback after completion of each session. Participants can choose between several elective sessions based on individual need. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate an internet- and mobile-based intervention for IUD, which could be a promising first step to reduce individuals' disease burden.

Methods: The characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients who completed online treatment at the MindSpot Clinic between January 2014 and December 2016 and reported a country of birth other than Australia were compared to Australian-born users. Data about the main language spoken at home were used to create distinct groups. Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 Item (GAD-7), respectively. Results: Of 52,020 people who started assessment at MindSpot between 1st January 2014 and 22nd December 2016, 45,082 reported a country of birth, of whom 78.6% ( n = 35,240) were Australian-born, and 21.4% ( n = 9842) were born overseas. Of 6782 people who completed the online treatment and reported country of birth and main language spoken at home, 1631 (24%) were migrants, 960 (59%) were from English-speaking countries, and 671 (41%) were from non-English speaking countries. Treatment-seeking migrant users reported higher rates of tertiary education than Australian-born users. The baseline symptom severity, and rates of symptom reduction and remission following online treatment were similar across groups. Conclusions: Online treatment was associated with significant reductions in anxiety and depression in migrants of both English speaking and non-English speaking backgrounds, with outcomes similar to those obtained by Australian-born patients. DMHS have considerable potential to help reduce barriers to mental health care for migrants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

Objective: To adapt, develop, and assess the feasibility of a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management Mobile Health (CBSM mHealth) application (app) for HIV-related fatigue. Methods: This study had two phases: app development with key informants ( N = 5) and a randomized controlled trial ( N = 30). Patients randomized to the intervention group completed 10 weekly CBSM modules; those in the control group received a generic healthy lifestyle app. Measures included HIV-related fatigue, depression, anxiety, stressful life events, CD4 count, HIV viral load, credibility and acceptability of the intervention, and barriers to treatment participation. Results: We were able to recruit participants for this study, and they were able to complete the required measures. They found the intervention to be credible and acceptable and reported few barriers to treatment participation. The direction of change in the primary outcome, a decrease in fatigue, is in the expected direction and provides evidence of the promise of the intervention, which still needs to be tested in an adequately powered trial. For completers (randomized to the intervention group and completed at least 80% of the modules), there were significant changes (95% CI; lower scores indicate improvement) in fatigue intensity (from 64.2 to 59.7) and overall fatigue-related functioning (from 6.6 to 4.2). Conclusion: We have proof of concept as to the feasibility, acceptability, and initial signals of efficacy for an mHealth intervention to help people with HIV-related fatigue better cope with stress and reduce their fatigue.

10.35946/arcr.v40.2.08,Treatment interventions for women with alcohol use disorder,"McCrady, Barbara S.;Epstein, Elizabeth E.;Fokas, Kathryn F.",Alcohol Research: Current Reviews,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Women with alcohol use disorder (AUD) experience more barriers to AUD treatment and are less likely to access treatment than men with AUD. A literature review identified several barriers to women seeking help: low perception of a need for treatment; guilt and shame; co-occurring disorders; employment, economic, and health insurance disparities; childcare responsibilities; and fear of child protective services. Women entering treatment present with more severe AUD and more complex psychological, social, and service needs than men. Treatment program elements that may reduce barriers to AUD treatment include provision of childcare, prenatal care, treatment for co-occurring psychological problems, and supplemental social services. Research has suggested that outcomes for women are best when treatment is provided in women-only programs that include female-specific content. To date, research on treatments tailored to the individual needs of women is limited, but research on mechanisms of change has suggested the importance of targeting anxiety and depression, affiliative statements in treatment, abstinence self-efficacy, coping skills, autonomy, and social support for abstinence. Future research should focus on early interventions, linkages between primary care or mental health clinics and AUD treatment settings, and integrated treatments for co-occurring AUD and other disorders. Further research should also explore novel treatment delivery approaches such as digital platforms and peer support groups.

10.2196/15644,Clinically meaningful use of mental health apps and its effects on depression: Mixed methods study,"Zhang, Renwen;Nicholas, Jennifer;Knapp, Ashley A.;Graham, Andrea K.;Gray, Elizabeth;Kwasny, Mary J.;Reddy, Madhu;Mohr, David C.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2019.7.25,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: User engagement is key to the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions. Considerable research has examined the clinical outcomes of overall engagement with mental health apps (eg, frequency and duration of app use). However, few studies have examined how specific app use behaviors can drive change in outcomes. Understanding the clinical outcomes of more nuanced app use could inform the design of mental health apps that are more clinically effective to users. Objective: This study aimed to classify user behaviors in a suite of mental health apps and examine how different types of app use are related to depression and anxiety outcomes. We also compare the clinical outcomes of specific types of app use with those of generic app use (ie, intensity and duration of app use) to understand what aspects of app use may drive symptom improvement. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of system use data from an 8-week randomized trial of a suite of 13 mental health apps. We categorized app use behaviors through a mixed methods analysis combining qualitative content analysis and principal component analysis. Regression analyses were used to assess the association between app use and levels of depression and anxiety at the end of treatment. Results: A total of 3 distinct clusters of app use behaviors were identified: learning, goal setting, and self-tracking. Each specific behavior had varied effects on outcomes. Participants who engaged in self-tracking experienced reduced depression symptoms, and those who engaged with learning and goal setting at a moderate level (ie, not too much or not too little) also had an improvement in depression. Notably, the combination of these 3 types of behaviors, what we termed “clinically meaningful use,” accounted for roughly the same amount of variance as explained by the overall intensity of app use (ie, total number of app use sessions). This suggests that our categorization of app use behaviors succeeded in capturing app use associated with better outcomes. However, anxiety outcomes were neither associated with specific behaviors nor generic app use. Conclusions: This study presents the first granular examination of user interactions with mental health apps and their effects on mental health outcomes. It has important implications for the design of mobile health interventions that aim to achieve greater user engagement and improved clinical efficacy.

Methods: We collected digital data consisting of individual activity records such as location or mobility information (lifelog data) from 89 patients who were on maintenance therapy for depression for a year, using a smartphone application and a wearable device. We assessed depression and its recurrence using both the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Results: A panel vector autoregressive analysis indicated that long sleep time was a important risk factor for the recurrence of depression. Long sleep predicted the recurrence of depression after 3 weeks. Conclusions: The panel vector autoregressive approach can identify the warning signs of depression recurrence; however, the convenient sampling of the present cohort may limit the scope towards drawing a generalised conclusion.

A second goal was to provide a descriptive analysis of OCD symptoms and influencing factors in participants' everyday lives. Thirty‐nine participants were included in the final analyses. EMA sampling involved a smartphone and comprised 4 days with 10 random prompts per day both before (Pre‐Treatment EMA) and after the completion of a 2‐week clinical intervention of either detached mindfulness or cognitive restructuring (Post‐Treatment EMA) that participants had been randomly allocated to. The EMA questionnaire included items on the frequency of obsessions, subjective burden due to obsessions, perceived current stress, emotions, and on the frequency of compulsions and other dysfunctional behaviors. Descriptive Pre‐Treatment EMA results highlight the importance of compulsions and emotional states of tension/discomfort in OCD. Pre–Post comparisons showed a significant reduction of avoidance behavior, obsessions, and burden due to obsessions, with a nonsignificant trend also indicating a reduction of compulsions. There was no pre to post effect concerning emotions. This study adds to the existing research on OCD symptoms and offers further evidence in confirmation of established theoretical models of OCD. Also, our results can be taken as evidence for treatment sensitivity of the EMA method in OCD. Further research is needed to replicate, broaden, and generalize our results.

The objective was by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the current evidence for the effect of MBT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients and survivors. Method: This study was part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial ( n = 245) on the effectiveness of MBCT or eMBCT for distressed cancer patients. The therapeutic alliance was measured at the start of week 2 (ie, early therapeutic alliance), week 5, and week 9. Outcome measures were psychological distress, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and mental well-being, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form. Results: he strength of early therapeutic alliance did not predict treatment dropout in MBCT or eMBCT ( B = −.39; P = .21).Therapeutic alliance increased over time in both conditions ( F 2,90 = 16.46; Wilks λ = 0.732; P &lt; .001). This increase did not differ between eMBCT and MBCT ( F 1,91 = 0.114; P = .74). Therapeutic alliance at week 2 predicted a decrease in psychological distress ( B = −.12; t ₁₁₄ = −2.656; P = .01) and an increase in mental well-being ( B = .23; t ₁₁₃ = 2.651; P = .01) at posttreatment. The relationship with reduction of psychological distress differed between treatments: a weaker early therapeutic alliance predicted higher psychological distress at posttreatment in MBCT but not in eMBCT ( B = .22; t ₁₁₃ = 2.261; P = .03). Conclusion: While the overall quality of existing clinical trials varies considerably, there appears to be some positive evidence from relatively high-quality RCTs to support the use of MBT for cancer patients and survivors with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Method: Self-reported medication use was recorded at baseline assessment for all patients enrolled in a validated pain management program provided free by a university research clinic (N = 471). Participants were randomized either to receive immediate treatment or to be a wait-list control. Opioid use at baseline assessment, with the daily doses converted to morphine equivalents, was compared with the self-reported opioid medication use at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. The relationship between opioid use and measures of psychological symptoms, pain, and disability was examined. Results: At assessment, 85% (n = 399) reported taking some form of pain modifying or psychotropic medication, 43.1% (n = 203) reported regular opioid use and 22.9% (n = 108) reported taking additional as required (pro re nata, or PRN) opioid-containing medication. On completion, there were significant reductions in the number who reported taking regular opioids and a large reduction in the use of PRN opioids and in the reported doses of opioids. Those reductions were more strongly associated with reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression than in measures of disability and pain. Conclusions: The reduction in the self-reported use of regular and PRN opioid pain-relieving medication following completion of an online pain management program with demonstrated efficacy in pain reduction appeared to be related to effective treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of 2 methods of maintaining engagement with the IntelliCare platform, coaching, and receipt of weekly recommendations to try different apps on depression, anxiety, and app use. Methods: A total of 301 participants with depression or anxiety were randomized to 1 of 4 treatments lasting 8 weeks and were followed for 6 months posttreatment. The trial used a 2X2 factorial design (coached vs self-guided treatment and weekly app recommendations vs no recommendations) to compare engagement metrics. Results: The median time to last use of any app during treatment was 56 days (interquartile range 54-57), with 253 participants (84.0%, 253/301) continuing to use the apps over a median of 92 days posttreatment. Receipt of weekly recommendations resulted in a significantly higher number of app use sessions during treatment (overall median = 216; P = .04) but only marginal effects for time to last use ( P = .06) and number of app downloads ( P = .08). Coaching resulted in significantly more app downloads ( P &lt; .001), but there were no significant effects for time to last download or number of app sessions ( P = .36) or time to last download ( P = .08). Participants showed significant reductions in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) across all treatment arms ( P s &lt; .001). Coached treatment led to larger GAD-7 reductions than those observed for self-guided treatment ( P = .03), but the effects for the PHQ-9 did not reach significance ( P = .06). Significant interaction was observed between receiving recommendations and time for the PHQ-9 ( P = .04), but there were no significant effects for GAD-7 ( P = .58). Conclusions: IntelliCare produced strong engagement with apps across all treatment arms. Coaching was associated with stronger anxiety outcomes, and receipt of recommendations enhanced depression outcomes.

The changes within each construct over time were also explored. A total of 1,610 valid responses from three-year longitudinal data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey were analysed and multivariate latent growth modeling was used. Depressive moods, problematic mobile phone use, and negative school outcomes at earlier ages each increased in severity across the three years. Initial levels of depressive moods increased initial levels of problematic mobile phone use and negative school outcomes, including changed rates of negative school outcomes. Additionally, changed rates of depressive moods positively predicted changed rates of problematic mobile phone use and negative school outcomes. Lastly, initial levels and changed rates of problematic mobile phone use predicted initial levels and changed rates of negative school outcomes respectively. Implications of the findings in the context of adolescents' psychological problems and problematic mobile phone use are discussed.

This study analyzed the mobile app data in a non-clinical sample of 39 adults participating in a larger randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) mobile app that tailors skill coaching based on in the- moment variables ( n = 17) or an app that provides randomly selected skill coaching ( n = 22). Data were collected before and after each ACT skill coaching session on proximal outcome (depression, anxiety, and engagement in meaningful activity) and ACT process variables. Multilevel models indicated significant immediate improvements on average following ACT skill coaching sessions on all proximal outcome and ACT process variables, although with relatively small effects ranging between 0.17 and 0.27 SD units change. Larger immediate pre-to-post effects from ACT coaching sessions were found for anxiety, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion in the tailored app versus random app condition. Overall, results suggest that an ACT app can have immediate, in-the-moment effects on psychological functioning, which may be enhanced by tailoring skills to current context.

10.1186/s12888-019-2110-y,HELP@APP: development and evaluation of a self-help app for traumatized Syrian refugees in Germany—A study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Golchert, Johannes;Roehr, Susanne;Berg, Franziska;Grochtdreis, Thomas;Hoffmann, Rahel;Jung, Franziska;Nagl, Michaela;Plexnies, Anna;Renner, Anna;König, Hans-Helmut;Kersting, Anette;Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.",BMC Psychiatry,,2019.1.25,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Syrians represent the largest group among refugees in Germany. Many of them were exposed to sequential traumatizing events including war, escape and post-migration stressors, which significantly increase the risk to develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress and other mental disorders. However, there is a lack of adequate treatment options for traumatized refugees in Germany. Moreover, their access to psychosocial care is often restricted due to legal regulation, language barriers, and unclear cost coverage. We therefore aim to develop a low-threshold supportive self-help app for Syrian refugees with posttraumatic stress symptoms. By conducting a randomized controlled trial, we further aim to evaluate the apps’ efficacy, usability, acceptance, and economic health benefit/cost-effectiveness. Methods: We will develop a modular, interactive self-help app in Arabic, which will be grounded on cognitive-behavioral models for the treatment of posttraumatic stress. Subsequently, screened positive (i.e., Syrian refugees, 18–65 years old, mild to moderate posttraumatic stress symptomatology as quantified by the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5/PDS-5) participants (ideally up to n = 234) will be randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) and control group (CG), respectively. Participants in the IG will gain access to the self-help app for one month, while participants in the CG will receive psychoeducational reading material in form of a comprehensive brochure on traumatization and posttraumatic stress. Measurements are scheduled before the intervention (T0), directly after the intervention (T1, one month later) and three months after the intervention (T2). Using linear mixed effect models, we will investigate change in posttraumatic symptomatology. We will also test for changes in secondary outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Moreover, we will inspect the usability and user acceptance of the app. To evaluate the app in terms of its economic health benefit, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated. Discussion: We plan to make the app freely available to the general public after evaluation. Thus, the app can help to add-on to routine care, which currently lacks sufficient and appropriate treatment options for Syrian refugees.

In the current study, we tested the efficacy of an online version of a compassion-focused intervention, mindfulness-based compassionate living (MBCL), with guidance on request. A total of 122 self-referred participants with increased levels of self-criticism were randomly assigned to care as usual (CAU) or the intervention group (CAU + online intervention). Primary endpoints were self-reported depressive, anxiety and distress symptoms (DASS-21) and self-compassion (SCS) at 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints were self-criticism, mindfulness, satisfaction with life, fear of self-compassion, self-esteem, and existential shame. At posttreatment, the intervention group showed significant changes with medium to large effect sizes compared to the control group regarding primary outcomes (Cohen’s d: 0.79 [DASS] and -1.21 [SCS]) and secondary outcomes (Cohen’s ds: between 0.40 and 0.94 in favor of the intervention group). The effects in the intervention group were maintained at 6-months postrandomization. Adherence measures (number of completed modules, self-reported number of completed exercises per week) predicted postintervention scores for self-compassion but not for depressive, anxiety, and distress symptoms in the intervention group. The current study shows the efficacy of an online intervention with a transdiagnostic intervention target on a broad range of measures, including depressive and anxiety symptoms and self-compassion.

A.;Haro, J. M.;Kerz, M.;Lamers, F.;Li, Q.;Manyakov, N. V.;Mohr, D. C.;Myin-Germeys, I.;Narayan, V.;BWJH, Penninx;Ranjan, Y.;Rashid, Z.;Rintala, A.;Siddi, S.;Simblett, S. K.;Wykes, T.;Hotopf, M.",BMC Psychiatry,,2018.9.7,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: There is a growing body of literature highlighting the role that wearable and mobile remote measurement technology (RMT) can play in measuring symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). Outcomes assessment typically relies on self-report, which can be biased by dysfunctional perceptions and current symptom severity. Predictors of depressive relapse include disrupted sleep, reduced sociability, physical activity, changes in mood, prosody and cognitive function, which are all amenable to measurement via RMT. This study aims to: 1) determine the usability, feasibility and acceptability of RMT; 2) improve and refine clinical outcome measurement using RMT to identify current clinical state; 3) determine whether RMT can provide information predictive of depressive relapse and other critical outcomes. Methods: RADAR-MDD is a multi-site prospective cohort study, aiming to recruit 600 participants with a history of depressive disorder across three sites: London, Amsterdam and Barcelona. Participants will be asked to wear a wrist-worn activity tracker and download several apps onto their smartphones. These apps will be used to either collect data passively from existing smartphone sensors, or to deliver questionnaires, cognitive tasks, and speech assessments. The wearable device, smartphone sensors and questionnaires will collect data for up to 2-years about participants’ sleep, physical activity, stress, mood, sociability, speech patterns, and cognitive function. The primary outcome of interest is MDD relapse, defined via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Self-Report questionnaire (IDS-SR) and the World Health Organisation’s self-reported Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF). Discussion: This study aims to provide insight into the early predictors of major depressive relapse, measured unobtrusively via RMT. If found to be acceptable to patients and other key stakeholders and able to provide clinically useful information predictive of future deterioration, RMT has potential to change the way in which depression and other long-term conditions are measured and managed.

Existing research has not determined if the benefits following CCT are specific to the content of CCT or are a function of participation in an engaging activity. In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, we tested whether executive functioning and processing speed (EF/PS)-focused CCT could outperform verbal ability-focused CCT. Methods: 46 young adults with at least mild depressive symptoms (HDRS ≥ 10) were recruited from the community and randomized to either EF/PS CCT or verbal ability CCT. Participants trained on their mobile device 5 days per week for 8 weeks. Depressive severity, everyday functioning, and cognition were evaluating pre and post-training. Results: The EF/PS group had greater gains in executive functioning and processing speed than the verbal group. There were no differences between groups in mood or everyday functioning improvement, though the EF/PS obtained equivalent improvement with half the training time. Both groups saw significant improvements in self and clinician-rated depressive severity, everyday functioning, and cognition. Limitations: There was no waitlist control condition and the sample consisted of individuals with mild depressive symptoms and not diagnosed major depressive disorder. Conclusions: CCT is associated with improved mood, cognition, and everyday functioning, though the type of CCT content does not differentially impact depressive symptom change. EF/PS focused CCT has greater impact on processing speed and executive functioning and leads to equivalent mood/everyday functioning gains as verbal-focused CCT more efficiently. Common factors remain plausible drivers of CCT's therapeutic effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

The current study examined how affect ratings during social interactions predict later perceptions of those interactions, and whether this differs by social anxiety and depression severity. Undergraduate participants ( N = 60) responded to a smartphone application that prompted participants to answer short questions about their current affect and social context up to 6 times a day for 2 weeks. At the end of each day, participants answered questions about their perceptions of their social interactions from that day. Results indicated that the link between negative affective experiences reported during social interactions and the end-of-day report of enjoyment (but not effectiveness) of those experiences was more negative when social anxiety was more severe. The link between negative affective experiences rated during social interactions and the end-of-day report of effectiveness (but not enjoyment) during those social encounters was more negative when depression was more severe. These findings demonstrate the importance of examining self-perceptions of social interactions based both on the extent to which individuals think that they met the objective demands of an interaction (i.e., effectiveness, mastery) and the extent to which they liked or disliked that interaction (i.e., enjoyment, pleasure). These findings also highlight how real-time assessments of daily social interactions may reveal the key experiences that contribute to negative self-evaluations across disorders, potentially identifying critical targets for therapy.

The cognitive-behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only psychotherapy specifically developed for its treatment. However, we do not know which of CBASP, antidepressant pharmacotherapy, or their combination is the most efficacious and for which types of patients. This study aims to present personalized prediction models to facilitate shared decision-making in treatment choices to match patients’ characteristics and preferences based on individual participant data network metaregression. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials comparing any two of CBASP, pharmacotherapy, or their combination and sought individual participant data from identified trials. The primary outcomes were reduction in depressive symptom severity for efficacy and dropouts due to any reason for treatment acceptability. Results: All 3 identified studies (1,036 participants) were included in the present analyses. On average, the combination therapy showed significant superiority over both monotherapies in terms of efficacy and acceptability, while the latter 2 treatments showed essentially similar results. Baseline depression, anxiety, prior pharmacotherapy, age, and depression subtypes moderated their relative efficacy, which indicated that for certain subgroups of patients either drug therapy or CBASP alone was a recommendable treatment option that is less costly, may have fewer adverse effects and match an individual patient’s preferences. An interactive web app (https://kokoro.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/CBASP/prediction/) shows the predicted disease course for all possible combinations of patient characteristics.

Although mobile platforms are being developed to give consumers greater access to high‐quality care, too often these tools do not have empirical support for their effectiveness. In this study, we evaluated PRIME‐D, a mobile app intervention that uses social networking, goal setting, and a mental health coach to deliver text‐based, EBT's to treat mood symptoms and functioning in adults with depression. Methods: Thirty‐six adults with depression remotely participated in PRIME‐D over an 8‐week period with a 4‐week follow‐up, with 83% retained over the 12‐week course of the study. Results: On average, participants logged into the app 5 days/week. Depression scores (PHQ‐9) significantly improved over time (over 50% reduction), with coach interactions enhancing these effects. Mood‐related disability (Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)) also significantly decreased over time with participants no longer being impaired by their mood symptoms. Overall use of PRIME‐D predicted greater gains in functioning. Improvements in mood and functioning were sustained over the 4‐week follow‐up. Conclusions: Results suggest that PRIME‐D is a feasible, acceptable, and effective intervention for adults with depression and that a mobile service delivery model may address the serious public health problem of poor access to high‐quality mental health care.

10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.004,Systematic review of the information and communication technology features of web- and mobile-based psychoeducational interventions for depression,"Zhao, Danyang;Lustria, Mia Liza A.;Hendrickse, Joshua",Patient Education and Counseling,,2016.6.3,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: To examine the information and communication technology (ICT) features of psychoeducational interventions for depression delivered via the Internet or via mobile technology. Methods: Web- and mobile-based psychoeducational intervention studies published from 2004 to 2014 were selected and reviewed by two independent coders. Results: A total of 55 unique studies satisfied the selection criteria. The review revealed a diverse range of ICTs used to support the psychoeducational programs. Most interventions used websites as their main mode of delivery and reported greater use of communication tools compared to effective approaches like tailoring or interactive technologies games, videos, and self-monitoring tools. Many of the studies relied on medium levels of clinician involvement and only a few were entirely self-guided. Conclusion: Programs that reported higher levels of clinician involvement also reported using more communication tools, and reported greater compliance to treatment. Future experimental studies may help unpack the effects of technology features and reveal new ways to automate aspects of clinician input. Practical implications: There is a need to further examine ways ICTs can be optimized to reduce the burden on clinicians whilst enhancing the delivery of proven effective therapeutic approaches.

10.3233/JAD-160518,A preliminary study on the feasibility of using a virtual reality cognitive training application for remote detection of mild cognitive impairment,"Zygouris, Stelios;Ntovas, Konstantinos;Giakoumis, Dimitrios;Votis, Konstantinos;Doumpoulakis, Stefanos;Segkouli, Sofia;Karagiannidis, Charalampos;Tzovaras, Dimitrios;Tsolaki, Magda",Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: It has been demonstrated that virtual reality (VR) applications can be used for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objective: The aim of this study is to provide a preliminary investigation on whether a VR cognitive training application can be used to detect MCI in persons using the application at home without the help of an examiner. Methods: Two groups, one of healthy older adults ( n = 6) and one of MCI patients ( n = 6) were recruited from Thessaloniki day centers for cognitive disorders and provided with a tablet PC with custom software enabling the self-administration of the Virtual Super Market (VSM) cognitive training exercise. The average performance (from 20 administrations of the exercise) of the two groups was compared and was also correlated with performance in established neuropsychological tests. Results: Average performance in terms of duration to complete the given exercise differed significantly between healthy (µ = 247.41 s/sd = 89.006) and MCI (µ = 454.52 s/sd= 177.604) groups, yielding a correct classification rate of 91.8% with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 89% respectively for MCI detection. Average performance also correlated significantly with performance in Functional Cognitive Assessment Scale (FUCAS), Test of Everyday Attention (TEA), and Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure test (ROCFT). Discussion: The VR application exhibited very high accuracy in detecting MCI while all participants were able to operate the tablet and application on their own. Diagnostic accuracy was improved compared to a previous study using data from only one administration of the exercise. The results of the present study suggest that remote MCI detection through VR applications can be feasible. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"
10.1080/15504263.2016.1267828,A preliminary investigation of a relapse prevention mobile application to maintain smoking abstinence among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Hicks, Terrell A.;Thomas, Shaun P.;Wilson, Sarah M.;Calhoun, Patrick S.;Kuhn, Eric R.;Beckham, Jean C.",Journal of Dual Diagnosis,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objectives: Smokers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have increased difficulty achieving and maintaining abstinence. Contingency management approaches to smoking cessation interventions have demonstrated short-term efficacy but are limited by high rates of relapse. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a smartphone-based smoking cessation application (Stay Quit Coach) designed to prevent relapse among individuals with PTSD. Methods: Smokers ( N = 11) were randomized to (1) QUIT4EVER, an intervention combining mobile contingency management smoking cessation counseling and medications, and Stay Quit Coach or (2) a contact control condition that was identical to QUIT4EVER except Stay Quit Coach was not included. The primary outcome was prolonged smoking abstinence. Results: Among those queried during the follow-up periods, average Stay Quit Coach helpfulness ratings were high and ranged from 7.25 to 10 on a 10-point Likert scale (with higher scores corresponding to greater helpfulness). The Stay Quit Coach was rated by participants as being most effective at helping to quit smoking, helping to remain quit, and providing support and relevant information about quitting. Among the three quitters in the QUIT4EVER group, all reported abstinence at 3 and 6 months; however, abstinence was only bioverified for one quitter at 6 months. Among the four quitters in the contact control condition group, three reported abstinence at 3 and 6 months, but abstinence was not confirmed by bioverification. Conclusions: Smokers with PTSD express interest in and helpfulness of Stay Quit Coach for remaining abstinent after a quit attempt. Combined use of mobile contingency management and Stay Quit Coach is a feasible and acceptable adjunctive smoking cessation treatment for reducing smoking among smokers with PTSD. Adequately powered clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of this combined approach to smoking cessation.

These features do not map well to the brief but frequent ways that people use mobile phones and mobile phone apps today. To address these challenges, we developed a suite of apps for depression and anxiety called IntelliCare, each developed with a focused goal and interactional style. IntelliCare apps prioritize interactive skills training over education and are designed for frequent but short interactions. Objective: The overall objective of this study was to pilot a coach-assisted version of IntelliCare and evaluate its use and efficacy at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Participants, recruited through a health care system, Web-based and community advertising, and clinical research registries, were included in this single-arm trial if they had elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety. Participants had access to the 14 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received 8 weeks of coaching on the use of IntelliCare. Coaching included an initial phone call plus 2 or more texts per week over the 8 weeks, with some participants receiving an additional brief phone call. Primary outcomes included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. Participants were compensated up to US $90 for completing all assessments; compensation was not for app use or treatment engagement. Results: Of the 99 participants who initiated treatment, 90.1% (90/99) completed 8 weeks. Participants showed substantial reductions in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 ( P &lt; .001). Participants used the apps an average of 195.4 (SD 141) times over the 8 weeks. The average length of use was 1.1 (SD 2.1) minutes, and 95% of participants downloaded 5 or more of the IntelliCare apps. Conclusions: This study supports the IntelliCare framework of providing a suite of skills-focused apps that can be used frequently and briefly to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. The IntelliCare system is elemental, allowing individual apps to be used or not used based on their effectiveness and utility, and it is eclectic, viewing treatment strategies as elements that can be applied as needed rather than adhering to a singular, overarching, theoretical model.

Cost-efficient interventions to improve and sustain ART adherence remain a pressing priority for populations challenged by nonadherence. The aim of this study was to test the independent and interactive effects of (1) brief phone-delivered self-regulation counseling and (2) daily phone-delivered text message medication reminders on HIV adherence and HIV viral suppression. Method: A randomized 2 (5 sessions of phone-delivered adherence support counseling vs. contact-matched control) × 2 (daily ART text reminders vs. no reminders) trial with primary end points of monthly phone-based unannounced pill count-determined ART adherence and HIV viral suppression monitored over 12 months. Results: Self-regulation adherence counseling demonstrated significant improvements in achieving 90% ART adherence relative to the control group over the first 6 months of follow-up. Effects remained significant in sensitivity analyses conducted at 85% and 95% adherence. Counseling also demonstrated modest but significant effects on HIV suppression. There were no main effects or interactions for daily text message reminders, with some evidence for adverse effects on adherence self-efficacy. Conclusions:Brief adherence support counseling delivered by phone demonstrates clinically meaningful improvements in ART adherence and HIV suppression, although these benefits were not evidenced in all patients or in the long-term. Advancing adherence interventions along with an effective means for sustaining gains in adherence remain priorities if ART is to achieve its potential clinical and public health benefits.

10.2196/jmir.4273,Mobile phone sensor correlates of depressive symptom severity in daily-life behavior: An exploratory study,"Saeb, Sohrab;Zhang, Mi;Karr, Christopher J.;Schueller, Stephen M.;Corden, Marya E.;Kording, Konrad P.;Mohr, David C.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,2015.1.21,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r = -.63, P = .005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r = -.58, P = .012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r = -.58, P = .012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated ( r = .54, P = .011, and r = .52, P = .015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 5) from those without (PHQ-9 score &lt; 5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.

However, the predictive factors that lead to online gaming addiction are not well established. The aim of this study was to identify factors that may influence the development of online gaming addiction. A total of 263 patients with problematic online gaming addiction (255 males (97%) and 8 females (3%), age: mean = 20.4 ± 5.8 years) and 153 healthy comparison subjects (118 males (77%) and 35 females (23%), age: 21.2 ± 5.5 years, range) were recruited for participation in the current study. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses among each set of variables were conducted. Individual factors (sex and age), cognitive factors (IQ and perseverative errors), psychopathological conditions (ADHD, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity), and social interaction factors (family environment, social anxiety, and self-esteem) were evaluated in a stepwise fashion. All four factors were associated with online gaming addiction, with psychopathological conditions being the strongest risk factors for the addiction. Individual factors, psychological factors, and social interactions were associated with the development of pure online gaming addiction. As before, psychological factors (attention, mood, anxiety and impulsivity) were the strongest risk factors for online gaming addiction in patients with pure online gaming addiction. Psychopathologies, including ADHD and depression, were the strongest factors associated with the development of online gaming addiction in individuals.

However, not all patients benefit from such treatments, and it is possible that some may experience negative effects. Investigations of face-to-face treatments indicate that deterioration occurs in 5–10% of all patients. The nature and scope of other negative effects of Internet interventions is, however, largely unknown. Hence, the current study explored patients' reported negative experiences while undergoing treatments delivered via the Internet. Data from four large clinical trials (total N = 558) revealed that 9.3% of patients reported some type of negative effects. Qualitative content analysis was used to explore the patients' responses to open-ended questions regarding their negative experiences. Results yielded two broad categories and four subcategories of negative effects: patient-related negative effects (insight and symptom) and treatment-related negative effects (implementation and format). Results emphasize the importance of always considering negative effects in Internet-based interventions, and point to several ways of preventing such experiences, including regular assessment of negative events, increasing the flexibility of treatment schedules and therapist contact, as well as prolonging the treatment duration.

In the current paper, we summarize the lessons our multi-institutional/multi-disciplinary team has learned conducting a range of mHealth projects using mobile phones with diverse clinical populations. First, we describe three ongoing projects that we draw from to illustrate throughout the paper. We then provide an example for multidisciplinary teamwork and conceptual mHealth intervention development that we found to be particularly useful. Finally, we discuss mHealth research challenges (i.e. evolving technology, mobile phone selection, user characteristics, the deployment environment, and mHealth system “bugs and glitches”), and provide recommendations for identifying and resolving barriers, or preventing their occurrence altogether.

C.;Kwakkel, Gert;Beek, Peter J.;Berendse, Henk W.;Daffertshofer, Andreas;van Wegen, Erwin E. H.",Parkinsonism & Related Disorders,,2014.5.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Balance training has been demonstrated to improve postural control in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this pilot randomized clinical trial was to investigate whether a balance training program using augmented visual feedback is feasible, safe, and more effective than conventional balance training in improving postural control in patients with PD. Methods: Thirty-three patients with idiopathic PD participated in a five-week training program consisting of ten group treatment sessions of 60 min. Participants were randomly allocated to (1) an experimental group who trained on workstations consisting of interactive balance games with explicit augmented visual feedback (VFT), or (2) a control group receiving conventional training. Standing balance, gait, and health status were assessed at entry, at six weeks, and at twelve weeks follow-up. Results: Sixteen patients were allocated to the control group and seventeen to the experimental group. The program was feasible to apply and took place without adverse events. Change scores for all balance measures favored VFT, but the change in the primary outcome measure, i.e. the Functional Reach test, did not differ between groups ( t (28) = -0.116, p = .908). No other differences between groups were statistically significant. Conclusions: VFT proved to be a feasible and safe approach to balance therapy for patients with PD. In this proof-of-concept study VFT was not superior over conventional balance training although observed trends mostly favored VFT. These trends approached clinical relevance only in few cases: increasing the training load and further optimization of VFT may strengthen this effect.

10.1186/1471-244X-13-306,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based intervention with mobile phone support to treat depressive symptoms in adults with diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2: Design of a randomised controlled trial,"Nobis, Stephanie;Lehr, Dirk;Ebert, David Daniel;Berking, Matthias;Heber, Elena;Baumeister, Harald;Becker, Annette;Snoek, Frank;Riper, Heleen",BMC Psychiatry,,2013.9.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus types 1 or 2 doubles the odds of a comorbid depressive disorder. The combined diseases have a wide range of adverse outcomes, such as a lower quality of life, poorer diabetes outcomes and increased healthcare utilisation. Diabetes patients with depression can be treated effectively with psychotherapy, but access to psychological care is limited. In this study we will examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed web-based intervention (GET.ON Mood Enhancer Diabetes) for people with diabetes and comorbid depressive symptoms. Methods/Design: A two-arm randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Adults with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) with increased depression scores (&gt; 22 on the German version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)) will be included. Eligible participants will be recruited through advertisement in diabetes patient journals and via a large-scale German health insurance company. The participants will be randomly assigned to either a 6-week minimally guided web-based self-help program or an online psychoeducation program on depression. The study will include 260 participants, which will enable us to detect a statistically significant difference with a group effect size of d = 0.35 at a power of 80% and a significance level of p = 0.05. The primary outcome measure will be the level of depression as assessed by the CES-D. The secondary outcome measures will be: diabetes-specific emotional distress, glycaemic control, self-management behaviour and the participants’ satisfaction with the intervention. Online self-assessments will be collected at baseline and after a 2 months period, with additional follow-up measurements 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. In addition, we will conduct an economic evaluation from a societal perspective. Discussion: If this intervention is shown to be cost-effective, it has considerable potential for implementing psychological care for large numbers of people with diabetes and comorbid depression in routine practice and improve health outcomes.

10.1038/oby.2012.96,Predictors of attendance in a practical clinical trial of two pediatric weight management interventions,"Jensen, Chad D.;Aylward, Brandon S.;Steele, Ric G.",Obesity,,2011.10.4,Scholarly Journals,English,"The objective of this study was to evaluate demographic and psychosocial predictors of attendance in a family-based behavioral weight management clinical trial. Ninety-three children and adolescents aged 7–17 (Mean age = 11.59, s.d. = 2.6) who were either overweight or obese (Mean BMI percentile = 98.2) and their parents received either a 10-session behavioral treatment or a three-session brief family intervention in the context of a randomized clinical trial (10). Psychosocial and anthropometric measures were obtained before enrollment and at the end of 10 weeks for both treatment groups. Univariate linear regression and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors of attendance to treatment from an a priori set of hypothesized predictors. Three variables demonstrated significant associations with the dependent variable, percent of treatment sessions attended. Specifically, distance from participant’s home to treatment site, lower gross family income, and youth self-report of depressive symptoms were each associated with lower percent attendance (all P s &lt; 0.05). These results corroborate (i.e., income, depressive symptoms) and expand (i.e., distance from treatment site) previous reports in the literature of potential barriers to effective treatment for pediatric obesity, and suggest the need for research on treatment delivery methods that could increase participation among low-income families (e.g., eHealth, mHealth options). Depressive symptoms could represent an additional barrier to treatment attendance, suggesting that assessment and treatment for these symptoms may be appropriate before commencing weight management treatment.

The major contribution of MDD to disability and health care costs is largely due to its highly recurrent nature. Accordingly, efforts to reduce the disabling effects of this chronic condition should shift to preventing recurrence, especially in patients at high risk of recurrence. Given its high prevalence and the fact that interventions are necessary during the remitted phase, new approaches are needed to prevent relapse in depression. Methods/design: The best established effective and available psychological intervention is cognitive therapy. However, it is costly and not available for most patients. Therefore, we will compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of self-management supported by online CT accompanied by SMS based tele-monitoring of depressive symptomatology, i.e. Mobile Cognitive Therapy (M-CT) versus treatment as us usual (TAU). Remitted patients (n = 268) with at least two previous depressive episodes will be recruited and randomized over (1) M-CT in addition to TAU versus (2) TAU alone, with follow-ups at 3, 12, and 24 months. Randomization will be stratified for number of previous episodes and type of treatment as usual. Primary outcome is time until relapse/recurrence over 24 months using DSM-IV-TR criteria as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). For the economic evaluation the balance between costs and health outcomes will be compared across strategies using a societal perspective. Discussion: Internet-based interventions might be helpful in empowering patients to become their own disease managers in this lifelong recurrent disorder. This is, as far as we are aware of, the first study that examines the (cost) effectiveness of an E-mental health program using SMS monitoring of symptoms with therapist support to prevent relapse in remitted recurrently depressed patients.

The needs, resources, and responses of rural caregivers, and the development, implementation, and evaluation of innovative services where they do not exist are of particular interest. Improved accessibility of diagnostic services in rural areas (e.g., mobile or traveling diagnostic clinics, coordinated by local health care professionals, with referral to local resources for followup) is needed. In many rural areas, the service delivery system is impoverished and fragmented and has insufficient health, mental health, and social services to be supportive of the AD caregiver. The need is especially acute in the area of counseling and mental health services, to assist caregivers in dealing with burden, anger, and depression, and in coping with the behavioral and emotional manifestations of AD. Outreach programs, based in community mental health centers, especially those in rural catchment areas, should receive service demonstration grants. More research is needed on how to develop and pay for user-friendly services in rural areas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The present study evaluated Agapé, a relationship wellness smartphone app optimized for broad dissemination through 4 years of persuasive system design driven by user feedback. Agapé builds moments of connection by providing daily prompts to couples and then showing them one another’s answers when both partners have responded. To evaluate Agapé, a single-arm, pilot study followed 405 couples ( n = 810 partners; 68% non-Latinx White; 50% female; M age = 29; 50% cohabiting; 31% married; 33% dissatisfied/distressed) through their first month of using the app. Agapé had high engagement (99%, completing M = 27 daily prompts dyadically) and 88% of couples provided follow-up data. The results among completers supported the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of Agapé, suggesting that partners found the app easy (74%) and enjoyable (93%) to use, particularly if they perceived their partners to be responsive. Most partners saw improvement in their relationships (80%) and in their individual well-being (70%). Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed significant within-person improvement on relationship functioning (decreases in relationship negative qualities and increases in relationship satisfaction, relationship positive qualities, and dedication) and on individual functioning (increases in vitality and quality of life with decreases in psychological distress and depressive symptoms) among completers (Cohen’s ds ranging from |.14 to .42|). Dosage effects demonstrated that gains in relationship quality were stronger for couples completing more daily prompts.

The results showed that participants in both the ACT and MI groups had significantly greater improvements across mental health outcomes compared to the WL group. No significant differences were observed between the ACT and MI groups except for psychological flexibility, which improved more in ACT than MI (d = −0.37). Compared to WL, the ACT group showed a greater improvement in PTSD symptoms ( d = −0.79), anxiety ( d = −0.62), depression ( d = -0.51), posttraumatic growth ( d = 0.46), and psychological flexibility ( d = 0.76). The drop-out rates in the ACT and MI were 25.76% and 39.71%, respectively. Participants in the ACT condition reported medium program satisfaction. The study suggests app-delivered ACT is efficacious in reducing PTSD symptoms and improving overall mental health among Chinese adults.

10.1007/s10942-022-00493-9,Assessing metacognitions in compulsive exercising: The construction and evaluation of the Metacognitions about Exercise Questionnaire,"Fioravanti, Giulia;Scappini, Agathe;Piselli, Selene;Spada, Marcantonio M.;Casale, Silvia",Journal of Rational-Emotive & Cognitive-Behavior Therapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"The metacognitive model of psychopathology has been applied to various psychological disorders, with a wide array of studies suggesting that metacognitions play an important role in addictive behaviors. Increasing scientific attention has been focused on a potential and relatively new form of behavioral addiction: compulsive exercising (i.e., when individuals gradually lose control over their exercise habits, act compulsively, and experience negative consequences). As no prior study has evaluated the role of metacognitions in compulsive exercising, the current study aimed to: (i) develop a self-report questionnaire measuring metacognitions about exercise; and (ii) to investigate the contribution of metacognitions to compulsive exercising. A 15 item self-report questionnaire, the Metacognitions about Exercise Questionnaire (MEPQ), was developed and administered to a community sample of 496 exercisers (F = 49.2%, mean age: 39.38, SD = 14.08). Factor analysis revealed a 4-factor solution (which explained 67.22% of variance; fit indices: χ² (84) = 176.12, p &lt; .001; χ²/ df = 2.1; RMSEA [90% CI ] = .07 [.05;.08]; CFI = .97; SRMR = .06): Positive Metacognitions about Emotional Regulation, Positive Metacognitions about Cognitive Regulation, Positive Metacognitions about Control Over Life, and Negative Metacognitions about Uncontrollability. Positive metacognitions about the usefulness of physical exercise for regulating negative emotional states and negative metacognitions about one’s inability to control the need to exercise significantly predicted compulsive exercising, independently of negative affect. The results of this study suggest that adopting the metacognitive framework of psychopathology to compulsive exercising may be relevant to understanding and treating this condition.

10.1016/j.jbct.2023.09.003,Exploration of the preliminary effectiveness and acceptability of a self-help digital intervention to support benzodiazepine cessation and improve mental health and wellbeing: A one-group pilot trial,"Klein, Britt;Oldenhof, Erin;Nguyen, Huy;Schattner, Peter;Shandley, Kerrie",Journal of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy,,2023.5.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Introduction: Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are often inappropriately prescribed to manage anxiety and insomnia for longer-term use, despite guidelines recommending short-term use (i.e., &lt; 4 weeks). A range of harms can occur rapidly with regular use, and dependence can make stopping BDZs challenging. Evidence shows that a combination of BDZ tapering and psychological support are effective interventions, yet are not widely accessible. Methods: This was a one-group pilot trial of a 6-week fully automated self-help BDZ digital intervention (‘BDZ digital health’), providing guidance on how to safely taper BDZs as well as psychological support. The trial was undertaken with Australian adults considering a reduction and/or withdrawal from their BDZ (N = 43). Participants were assessed at pre-intervention (Week 0), during intervention (Week 3), post-intervention (Week 6), and at a 3- and 6-month follow-up (Week 18 and 30 respectively). Results: Reductions in BDZ use and self-reported dependency were observed over the course of the intervention. Significant symptom reductions in anxiety, insomnia, depression, psychological distress, and emotional dysregulation, as well as improvements in mental wellbeing and quality of life were observed when looking across all timepoints. However, the specific assessment timepoint changes for depression and psychological distress did not reach significance from the pre- to post-intervention timepoint. The intervention acceptability ratings were in the moderately high to high range. Discussion: The preliminary results of the pilot trial suggest that BDZ digital health is an acceptable and promising self-help digital intervention to assist adults reducing and withdrawing from their BDZs, and to improve their mental health and wellbeing.

10.1176/appi.ps.20220201,A machine-learning approach to assess factors associated with hospitalization of children and youths in psychiatric crisis,"Chen, Yen-Ling;Kraus, Shane W.;Freeman, Megan J.;Freeman, Andrew J.",Psychiatric Services,,2022.4.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: The authors used a machine-learning approach to model clinician decision making regarding psychiatric hospitalization of children and youths in crisis and to identify factors associated with the decision to hospitalize. Methods: Data consisted of 4,786 mobile crisis response team assessments of children and youths, ages 4.0-19.5 years (mean±SD=14.0±2.7 years, 56% female), in Nevada. The sample assessments were split into training and testing data sets. A random-forest machine-learning algorithm was used to identify variables related to the decision to hospitalize a child or youth after the crisis assessment. Results from the training sample were externally validated in the testing sample. Results: The random-forest model had good performance (area under the curve training sample=0.91, testing sample=0.92). Variables found to be important in the decision to hospitalize a child or youth were acute suicidality, followed by poor judgment or decision making, danger to others, impulsivity, runaway behavior, other risky behaviors, nonsuicidal self-injury, psychotic or depressive symptoms, sleep problems, oppositional behavior, poor functioning at home or with peers, depressive or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and age. Conclusions: In crisis settings, clinicians were found to mostly focus on acute factors that increased risk for danger to self or others (e.g., suicidality, poor judgment), current psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychotic symptoms), and functioning (e.g., poor home functioning, problems with peer relationships) when deciding whether to hospitalize or stabilize a child or youth. To reduce psychiatric hospitalization, community-based services should target interventions to address these important factors associated with the need for a higher level of care among youths in psychiatric crisis.

Related longitudinal studies in remitted patients with recurrent major depression are lacking. Long-term changes in such short-term within-person associations can be analysed via measurement burst designs. Two bursts, separated by approximately 4.4 years, consisted of a baseline session and an Ambulatory Assessment (burst-1: 3 days, burst-2: 5 days). Via smartphone, 54 initially remitted patients with recurrent major depression indicated their negative and positive affect, rumination, self-acceptance, and the occurrence of negative and positive daily events ten times and collected saliva cortisol samples five times per day. In bursts with higher depression levels, patients showed blunted negative affect- and cortisol-reactivity and stronger decreases in positive affect and self-acceptance toward negative daily events, as well as stronger increases in self-acceptance following positive daily events. However, patients with higher depression levels demonstrated stronger ruminative stress-reactivity within bursts. Furthermore, patients with higher depression levels showed an increase of affective stress-reactivity over bursts, such that negative affect more strongly increased and positive affect more strongly decreased following negative daily events over bursts. Following positive daily events, patients with higher depression levels showed stronger decreases in negative affect within bursts and a decrease of self-acceptance-reactivity over bursts. To conclude, measurement burst designs enable to examine intraindividual variability and change of micro-level processes, and possible moderators thereof, potentially providing prognostic information for the course of recurrent major depression.

10.1016/j.brat.2023.104382,Depression deconstructed: Wearables and passive digital phenotyping for analyzing individual symptoms,"Lekkas, Damien;Gyorda, Joseph A.;Price, George D.;Jacobson, Nicholas C.",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,2023.4.19,Scholarly Journals,English,"Wearable technology enables unobtrusive collection of longitudinally dense data, allowing for continuous monitoring of physiology and behavior. These digital phenotypes, or device-based indicators, are frequently leveraged to study depression. However, they are usually considered alongside questionnaire sum-scores which collapse the symptomatic gamut into a general representation of severity. To explore the contributions of passive sensing streams more precisely, associations of nine passive sensing-derived features with self-report responses to Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) items were modeled. Using data from the NetHealth study on N = 469 college students, this work generated mixed ordinal logistic regression models to summarize contributions of pulse, movement, and sleep data to depression symptom detection. Emphasizing the importance of the college context, wearable features displayed unique and complementary properties in their heterogeneously significant associations with CES-D items. This work provides conceptual and exploratory blueprints for a reductionist approach to modeling depression within passive sensing research.

10.1002/capr.12667,"Therapist training in video chat technology for use in an adaptive digital mental health intervention: Challenges, facilitators and implications for training models","Andrews, Brooke;Klein, Britt;Corboy, Denise;McLaren, Suzanne;Watson, Shaun",Counselling & Psychotherapy Research,,2022.10.27,Scholarly Journals,English,"Objective: This qualitative study investigated therapist training experiences, elements of skill acquisition, and barriers and facilitators associated with conducting assessments, and the delivery of low- and high-intensity therapist assistance delivered via video chat technology, adjunctive to a transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention programme for anxiety and depression. Methodology: In total, 34 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 therapists. Twenty interviews explored experiences of training to administer a clinical assessment tool, and 14 additional interviews explored training experiences of delivering low- and high-intensity therapist assistance via video chat technology. Results: Reflexive thematic analysis identified three themes: video chat skill acquisition, competencies transferrable to video chat and video chat service quality. Training and supervision were identified as important to scaffold skill development, and therapists described surprise that their skill set was transferrable to video chat. The most cited barrier to the adoption of video chat was the management of risk and distress, along with environmental suitability. Frequently cited facilitators to the adoption of video chat included stable Internet connection, protocols and resources. Conclusion: The benefits of video chat technology and digital mental health interventions can be maximised through the expansion and integration of training into existing teaching curricula. If therapists are familiarised and competent to deliver mental health services via the Internet, as well as in person, the future adoption of blended and stepped-care models is likely to be increased.

10.1016/j.jbct.2023.05.004,Risk scores in digital psychiatry: Expanding the reach of complex smartphone data by condensing it into simple results,"Langholm, Carsten;Alon, Noy;Perret, Sarah;Torous, John",Journal of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy,,2022.12.29,Scholarly Journals,English,"As college counseling centers struggle to meet the growing demands of behavioral health services, digital mental health tools like smartphone apps offer a scalable solution to increase access to care. However, clinicians report greater time demands and uncertainty over how to act upon digital data. In this paper, by using established statistical techniques, we condense complex smartphone data into results that are quickly understood and clinically meaningful. Specifically, we show how smartphone digital phenotyping data collected by college students can be used to predict an individual’s anxiety and depression level on a daily or weekly basis with an error of less than 10%. These predictions are then condensed into a 1 to 5 scale with a 1 representing patients with the lowest risk of presenting high anxiety or depression, and a 5 representing the patients with the highest risk. If used in a clinical setting, these risk scores have the potential to help college counseling centers monitor symptom severity in real-time via students’ own smartphones, allocate resources more efficiently, and ensure that students are receiving the appropriate level of treatment.

10.1016/j.brat.2023.104292,The efficacy of self-guided internet and mobile-based interventions for preventing anxiety and depression—A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Edge, Daniel;Watkins, Edward R.;Limond, Jenny;Mugadza, Jane",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,2023.1.6,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent mental disorders which are associated with a considerable personal and economic burden. As treatment alone has a minimal impact on prevalence, there is now a growing focus on interventions which may help prevent anxiety and depression. Internet and mobile based interventions have been identified as a useful avenue for the delivery of preventative programmes due to their scalability and accessibility. The efficacy of interventions that do not require additional support from a trained professional (self-guided) in this capacity is yet to be explored. Method: A systematic search was conducted on the Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, OVID, MEDline, PsycEXTRA and SCOPUS databases. Studies were selected according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was evaluating the effect of self-guided internet and mobile based interventions on incidence of anxiety and depression. The secondary outcome was effect on symptom severity. Results: After identifying and removing duplicates, 3211 studies were screened, 32 of which were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Nine studies also reported incidence data (depression = 7, anxiety = 2). The overall Risk Ratios for incidence of anxiety and depression were 0.86 (95% CI [0.28, 2.66], p = .79) and 0.67 (95% CI [0.48, 0.93], p = .02) respectively. Analysis for 27 studies reporting severity of depressive symptoms revealed a significant posttreatment standardised mean difference of −0.27 (95% CI [ −0.37, −0.17], p &lt; .001) for self-guided intervention groups relative to controls. A similar result was observed for 29 studies reporting severity of anxiety symptoms with a standardised mean difference of −0.21 (95% CI [-0.31, −0.10], p &lt; .001). Conclusions: Self-guided internet and mobile based interventions appear to be effective at preventing incidence of depression, though further examination of the data suggests that generalisability of this finding may be limited. While self-guided interventions also appear effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, their ability to prevent incidence of anxiety is less clear. A heavy reliance on symptom measures in the data analysed suggests future research could benefit from prioritising the use of standardised diagnostic measuring tools to assess incidence. Future systematic reviews should aim to include more data from grey literature and reduce the impact of study heterogeneity.

10.1016/j.jbtep.2022.101799,Building closer friendships in social anxiety disorder: A randomized control trial of an internet-based intervention,"Mueller, Nora E.;Cougle, Jesse R.",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,2022.3.23,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and objectives: Loneliness is an important factor in mental and physical health. People with social anxiety disorder (SAD) often report high levels of loneliness, which may be maintained by difficulties with intimacy. Building Closer Friendships (BCF) is a technology-based intervention we developed to reduce loneliness through reducing fear of intimacy in individuals with SAD. Methods: A sample of individuals with current SAD ( N = 55), were randomized to BCF or waitlist control conditions and completed self-report assessments of loneliness, fear of intimacy, social anxiety and other outcomes throughout the study. An in vivo conversation task was also administered at post-treatment to assess distress and perceived disclosure, warmth, and friendliness of participants when interacting with a stranger. Results: In the intent-to-treat analyses, the BCF group reported lower fear of intimacy at post-treatment compared to the control group. Among completers, BCF led to lower fear of intimacy at post-treatment and follow-up, and lower loneliness and depression at follow-up compared to the waitlist control. No treatment effects were found in the conversation task or for other symptom outcomes, including social anxiety. Analyses of treatment components revealed that the frequency of emotional check-ins with friends was associated with reductions in loneliness and depression. Limitations: The study was limited by the sample of primarily undergraduate college students, and use of self-report measures. Conclusions: This preliminary study found modest support for BCF as a computerized intervention to reduce fear of intimacy and loneliness in individuals with SAD.

10.1016/j.jbtep.2022.101791,Assessing the effects of acute reductions in mobile device social media use on anxiety and sleep,"Mahalingham, Tamsin;Howell, Joel;Clarke, Patrick J. F.",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,2021.7.9,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and objectives: Research has consistently suggested social media exerts negative effects on sleep and anxiety. Researchers have however, relied heavily on self-report measures of social media use and correlational designs. The present study employed an experimental manipulation to examine the effects of an acute reduction of social media use over a one-week period to assess the potential causal role of social media use in anxiety and sleep quality. Methods: Baseline social media use across one week was captured via smartphones, in addition to questionnaire measures of anxiety and sleep quality in a group of 93 unselected participants (female = 48, male = 43, did not specify = 2). Participants were then randomly assigned to suspend social media use for one week, whilst the other half used social media as normal. At the end of this week participants returned for a second data collection session where the same measures were re-administered. Results: No evidence of a causal effect of social media use on anxiety or sleep quality was observed. Limitations: While capturing objective mobile social media data, future research could also benefit from incorporating usage data from computers and other devices. Conclusions: The discussion considers the possibility that the findings may represent the genuine absence of such a relationship versus the failure to detect an extant relationship and the importance of including objective measures of social media use.

This study examined if attendance and depression treatment outcomes could be improved by matching patients to either face-to-face or computerized low-intensity psychological interventions. Methods: Archival clinical records were analysed for 85,664 patients who accessed face-to-face or computerized guided self-help (GSH). The primary outcome was early dropout (attending ≤3 sessions). Supervised machine learning analyses were applied in a training sample (n = 55,529). The trained algorithm was cross-validated in an independent test sample (n = 30,135). The clinical utility of the model was evaluated using logistic regression, chi-square tests, and sensitivity analyses in a balanced subsample. Results: Patients who received their model-indicated treatment modality were 12% more likely to receive an adequate dose of treatment OR = 1.12 (95% CI = 1.02 to 1.24), p = .02, and the strength of this effect was larger in the balanced subsample (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.68, p &lt; .001). Patients had better treatment outcomes when matched to their model-indicated treatment modality. Conclusions: Machine learning approaches may enable services to optimally match patients to the treatment modality that maximizes attendance.

In this study, we examined linguistic patterns of adolescent responses to writing prompts in a large, well-powered trial of an evidence-based, digital single-session intervention teaching malleability beliefs about personal traits and symptoms (“growth mindset”). Participants who completed the intervention as part of a larger randomized control trial were included in this preregistered study ( n = 638, https://osf.io/zqmxt). Participants’ responses were processed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. We tested correlations between linguistic variables (i.e., linguistic distancing, positive affect, negative affect, insight, certainty), baseline outcome variables, post-intervention outcome variables, and 3-month post-intervention outcome variables. We also used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression models to identify key predictors of treatment outcomes. As hypothesized, greater use of linguistic distancing was associated with lower levels of baseline hopelessness and higher levels of perceived agency. Additionally, per LASSO models including all linguistic variables, greater use of linguistic distancing predicted larger reductions in depressive symptoms from baseline to three-month follow-up. Linguistic distancing appeared to account for 27% of the variance in depression trajectories when also accounting for baseline depression.

Objective: To systematically review the current evidence regarding the use of VR in the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders. Data source: Systematic literature searches via PubMed (last literature update: 9th of May 2022) were conducted for the following areas of psychopathology: Specific phobias, panic disorder and agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, dementia disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and addiction disorders. Eligibility criteria: To be eligible, studies had to be published in English, to be peer-reviewed, to report original research data, to be VR-related, and to deal with one of the above-mentioned areas of psychopathology. Study evaluation: For each study included, various study characteristics (including interventions and conditions, comparators, major outcomes and study designs) were retrieved and a risk of bias score was calculated based on predefined study quality criteria. Results: Across all areas of psychopathology, k = 9315 studies were inspected, of which k = 721 studies met the eligibility criteria. From these studies, 43.97% were considered assessment-related, 55.48% therapy-related, and 0.55% were mixed. The highest research activity was found for VR exposure therapy in anxiety disorders, PTSD and addiction disorders, where the most convincing evidence was found, as well as for cognitive trainings in dementia and social skill trainings in autism spectrum disorder. Conclusion: While VR exposure therapy will likely find its way successively into regular patient care, there are also many other promising approaches, but most are not yet mature enough for clinical application.

M.;Knapstad, Marit;Grey, Nick;Smith, Otto R. F.",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,2021.7.2,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: In this exploratory study, we investigated a comprehensive set of potential moderators of response to the primary care service Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC). Methods: Data from an RCT of PMHC (n = 463) versus treatment as usual (TAU, n = 215) were used. At baseline mean age was 34.8, 66.7% were women, and 91% scored above caseness for depression (PHQ-9) and 87% for anxiety (GAD-7). Outcomes: change in symptoms of depression and anxiety and change in remission status from baseline to six- and 12- months follow-up. Potential moderators: sociodemographic, lifestyle, social, and cognitive variables, variables related to (mental) health problem and care. Each moderator was examined in generalized linear mixed models with robust maximum likelihood estimation. Results: Effect modification was only identified for anxiolytic medication for change in symptoms of depression and anxiety; clients using anxiolytic medication showed less effect of PMHC relative to TAU (all p &lt; 0.001), although this result should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of anxiolytic users in the sample. For remission status, none of the included variables moderated the effect of treatment. Conclusion: As a treatment for depression and/or anxiety, PMHC mostly seems to work equally well as compared to TAU across a comprehensive set of potential moderators.

B.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,2022.6.30,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Gait is an essential manifestation of depression. However, the gait characteristics of daily walking and their relationships with depression have yet to be fully explored. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore associations between depression symptom severity and daily-life gait characteristics derived from acceleration signals in real-world settings. Methods: We used two ambulatory data sets (N = 71 and N = 215) with acceleration signals collected by wearable devices and mobile phones, respectively. We extracted 12 daily-life gait features to describe the distribution and variance of gait cadence and force over a long-term period. Spearman coefficients and linear mixed-effects models were used to explore the associations between daily-life gait features and depression symptom severity measured by the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) self-reported questionnaires. The likelihood-ratio (LR) test was used to test whether daily-life gait features could provide additional information relative to the laboratory gait features. Results: Higher depression symptom severity was significantly associated with lower gait cadence of high-performance walking (segments with faster walking speed) over a long-term period in both data sets. The linear regression model with long-term daily-life gait features ( R ² = 0.30) fitted depression scores significantly better (LR test P = .001) than the model with only laboratory gait features ( R ² = 0.06). Conclusions: This study indicated that the significant links between daily-life walking characteristics and depression symptom severity could be captured by both wearable devices and mobile phones. The daily-life gait patterns could provide additional information for predicting depression symptom severity relative to laboratory walking. These findings may contribute to developing clinical tools to remotely monitor mental health in real-world settings.

This study explores the mechanisms of action of the e-coachER intervention using measures of the behaviour change processes integral to the intervention’s logic model. Methods: Four hundred fifty adults with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis or history of depression referred to an ERS were recruited in Plymouth, Birmingham and Glasgow. The e-coachER intervention comprising 7-Steps to Health was aligned with Self-Determination Theory and mapped against evidence-based behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Participants completed questionnaires at 0, 4, and 12 months to assess PA and self-reported offline engagement with core BCTs in day-to-day life (including action planning and self-monitoring) and beliefs relating to PA (including perceived importance, confidence, competence, autonomy and support). We compared groups at 4 and 12 months, controlling for baseline measures and other covariates. Mediation analysis using the product of coefficients method was used to determine if changes in process variables mediated intervention effects on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recorded by accelerometer and self-report at 4- and 12-months. Results: The internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) for all multi-item scales was &gt; 0.77. At 4-months, those randomised to e-coachER reported higher levels of PA beliefs relating to importance (1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42 to 1.61, p = 0.001), confidence (1.28, 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.98, p &lt; 0.001), competence (1.61, 95% CI: .68 to 2.54, p = 0.001), availability of support (0.77, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.48, p = 0.031), use of action planning (1.54, 95% CI: 0.23 to 2.85, p = 0.021) and use of self-monitoring (0.76, 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.32, p = 0.009) compared to ERS alone. There were no intervention effects on autonomous beliefs or perceived frequency of support, compared to ERS alone. At the 12-month follow-up, participants belief in the importance of PA was the only process measure to remain significantly higher in the e-coachER group when compared to ERS alone (0.75, 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.45). Intervention effects on perceived importance (2.52, 95% CI: 0.45 to 5.39), action planning (1.56, 95% CI: 0.10 to 3.54) and self-monitoring (1.92, 95% CI: 0.21 to 4.33) at 4-months significantly mediated change in accelerometer measured MVPA at 12-months (recorded in ≥ 10-min bouts). Conclusions: e-coachER led to some short-term changes in most process outcomes. Some of these processes also appeared to mediate e-coachER effects on changes in accelerometer measured MVPA. Further work should be carried out to understand how best to design and implement theoretically underpinned web-based physical activity promotion interventions within ERS.

10.1097/NMD.0000000000001503,Health-related behaviors and perceived addictions: Predictors of depression during the COVID lockdown,"Canas-Simião, Hugo;Reis, Cátia;Carreiras, Diogo;Espada-Santos, Pedro;Paiva, Teresa",Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide implementation of measures to contain the virus from spreading, and social isolation was one of those measures. Social isolation is associated with increased susceptibility to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Because this risk varies between populations and their respective habits, understanding which behaviors play a positive or harmful role is fundamental for people with depression under these conditions. This study aims to 1) compare health-related behaviors (HRBs) and perceived addictions between healthy individuals and individuals who reported having a depressive disorder at the time of the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal, and 2) test which HRB and perceived addictions are associated with depression. Participants were a matched for age and sex and comprised 968 adults divided into two groups: healthy (484, 50%) and depressed (484, 50%). They completed online self-report questionnaires, and the data were analyzed in SPSS. Logistic regressions showed that being a health professional, getting up in a later time during weekends, and a higher consumption of soft drinks increased the risk for depression. In contrast, higher education and higher intensity of physical activity decreased this risk. Perceived addictions to TV, social networking, and gaming increased the risk for depression. HRBs and the identified addictions associated with depression during the confinement should be targeted in clinical and community interventions.

A.;Ranjan, Y.;Rashid, Z.;Cummins, N.;Dineley, J.;Vairavan, S.;Hotopf, M.",Journal of Affective Disorders,,2022.3.21,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background: Remote sensing for the measurement and management of long-term conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is becoming more prevalent. User-engagement is essential to yield any benefits. We tested three hypotheses examining associations between clinical characteristics, perceptions of remote sensing, and objective user engagement metrics. Methods: The Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse—Major Depressive Disorder (RADAR-MDD) study is a multicentre longitudinal observational cohort study in people with recurrent MDD. Participants wore a FitBit and completed app-based assessments every two weeks for a median of 18 months. Multivariable random effects regression models pooling data across timepoints were used to examine associations between variables. Results: A total of 547 participants (87.8% of the total sample) were included in the current analysis. Higher levels of anxiety were associated with lower levels of perceived technology ease of use; increased functional disability was associated with small differences in perceptions of technology usefulness and usability. Participants who reported higher system ease of use, usefulness, and acceptability subsequently completed more app-based questionnaires and tended to wear their FitBit activity tracker for longer. All effect sizes were small and unlikely to be of practical significance. Limitations: Symptoms of depression, anxiety, functional disability, and perceptions of system usability are measured at the same time. These therefore represent cross-sectional associations rather than predictions of future perceptions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that perceived usability and actual use of remote measurement technologies in people with MDD are robust across differences in severity of depression, anxiety, and functional impairment.

Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. Methods: We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. Results: In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Limitations: Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Conclusions: Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention.

Remote Measurement Technologies (RMT) provide an opportunity to transform the measurement and management of MDD, via data collected from inbuilt smartphone sensors and wearable devices alongside app-based questionnaires and tasks. A key question for the field is the extent to which participants can adhere to research protocols and the completeness of data collected. We aimed to describe drop out and data completeness in a naturalistic multimodal longitudinal RMT study, in people with a history of recurrent MDD. We further aimed to determine whether those experiencing a depressive relapse at baseline contributed less complete data. Methods: Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Major Depressive Disorder (RADAR-MDD) is a multi-centre, prospective observational cohort study conducted as part of the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) program. People with a history of MDD were provided with a wrist-worn wearable device, and smartphone apps designed to: a) collect data from smartphone sensors; and b) deliver questionnaires, speech tasks, and cognitive assessments. Participants were followed-up for a minimum of 11 months and maximum of 24 months. Results: Individuals with a history of MDD ( n = 623) were enrolled in the study. We report 80% completion rates for primary outcome assessments across all follow-up timepoints. 79.8% of people participated for the maximum amount of time available and 20.2% withdrew prematurely. We found no evidence of an association between the severity of depression symptoms at baseline and the availability of data. In total, 110 participants had &gt;50% data available across all data types. Conclusions: RADAR-MDD is the largest multimodal RMT study in the feld of mental health. Here, we have shown that collecting RMT data from a clinical population is feasible. We found comparable levels of data availability in active and passive forms of data collection, demonstrating that both are feasible in this patient group.

Single-session interventions, interventions designed to last one session, may be a low-cost and timely resource for adolescents engaging in SITBs who may not otherwise receive treatment. Method: 565 adolescents ( M age = 14.95 years) endorsing recent engagement in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) were randomized to receive a 30-min, web-based, single-session intervention—“Project SAVE”—or an active, attention-matched control program. Proximal outcomes were measured at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Long-term outcomes were measured at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Results: Adolescents rated Project SAVE as acceptable; 80% of participants randomized to SAVE completed the intervention. Between-group effects were non-significant for pre-registered outcomes: post-intervention likelihood of future NSSI; 3-month frequencies of NSSI and suicidal ideation at follow-up. Relative to control-group participants, SAVE participants reported short-term improvements in two exploratory outcomes: self-hatred ( d = −.35, p &lt; .001) and desire to stop future NSSI ( d = .25, p = .003). Conclusions: Project SAVE is an acceptable resource for adolescents engaging in SITBs—with short-term effects on clinically-relevant outcomes. Future research may evaluate SAVE as an easy-to-access, short-term coping resource for youth engaging in SITBs.

Mental health may play an important role, however previous research exploring this association is limited with inconsistent findings. We aimed to investigate whether mental health was associated with attendance and engagement in a trial of behavioural weight management programmes. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of the Weight loss referrals for adults in primary care (WRAP) trial, which randomised 1267 adults with overweight or obesity to brief intervention, WW (formerly Weight Watchers) for 12-weeks, or WW for 52-weeks. We used regression analyses to assess the association of baseline mental health (depression and anxiety (by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (by EQ5D), satisfaction with life (by Satisfaction with Life Questionnaire)) with programme attendance and engagement in WW groups, and trial attendance in all randomised groups. Results: Every one unit of baseline depression score was associated with a 1% relative reduction in rate of WW session attendance in the first 12 weeks (Incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.98, 0.999). Higher baseline anxiety was associated with 4% lower odds to report high engagement with WW digital tools (Odds ratio [OR] 0.96; 95% CI 0.94, 0.99). Every one unit of global quality of life was associated with 69% lower odds of reporting high engagement with the WW mobile app (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.15, 0.64). Greater symptoms of depression and anxiety and lower satisfaction with life at baseline were consistently associated with lower odds of attending study visits at 3-, 12-, 24-, and 60-months. Conclusions: Participants were less likely to attend programme sessions, engage with resources, and attend study assessments when reporting poorer baseline mental health. Differences in attendance and engagement were small, however changes may still have a meaningful effect on programme effectiveness and trial completion. Future research should investigate strategies to maximise attendance and engagement in those reporting poorer mental health.

This study used an integrated data analysis approach to identify family and program-related factors that influence outcomes. We combined individual data from seven published efficacy trials of the web-based version of the Triple P—Positive Parenting Program. Data were analyzed for 985 families with children aged between 2 and 12 years ( M = 4.87; SD = 2.14) using a Latent Change Score approach. At post-intervention, sociodemographic factors were not predictive of changes in child behavior problems, while parents of boys and those with higher education showed greater improvements in dysfunctional parenting. Parents who were initially more confident in their parenting showed more overall gains while parents with more initial adjustment difficulties showed less improvement. Only the effect of baseline child behavior problems on changes in dysfunctional parenting was moderated by treatment condition. At follow-up, program variant and completion were the primary outcome predictors, with completion found to be related to initial parenting confidence, internet usage and program variant. The implications of these findings for reaching and retaining parents in online programs across all phases of the engagement process are discussed.

Nevertheless, although there is meta-analytical evidence on the efficacy of face-to-face ACT, no reviews have been performed on online ACT in this population. The aim of this meta-analysis is to determine the efficacy of online ACT for adults with chronic pain, when compared with controls. PubMed, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Web of Knowledge were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of online-delivered ACT for chronic pain. Effects were analyzed at post-treatment and follow-up, by calculating standardized mean differences. Online-delivered ACT was generally favored over controls (5 RCTs, N = 746). At post-treatment, medium effects for pain interference and pain acceptance, and small effects for depression, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility were found. A medium effect for pain interference and acceptance, and small effects for pain intensity, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility were found at follow-up. ACT-related effects for pain interference, pain intensity, mindfulness, and anxiety increased from post-treatment to follow-up. Nevertheless, the current findings also highlight the need for more methodologically robust RCTs. Future trials should compare online ACT with active treatments, and use measurement methods with low bias. Perspective: This is the first meta-analytical review on the efficacy of online ACT for people with chronic pain. It comprises 5 RCTs that compared online ACT with active and/or inactive controls. Online ACT was more efficacious than controls regarding pain interference, pain intensity, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and psychological flexibility.

Among the many activities available on the Internet, the time spent gaming appears one of the most frequent risk factors in developing PIU. The aim of the current study was to model the relationship between negative affect, metacognitions about online gaming, frequency of online gaming and PIU. A total of 326 Italian gamers (mean age = 27 years, SD = 5.65 years; 93.3% males) participated in the study. The pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model was examined through path analysis. Results showed that negative affect was directly associated with all other variables. Specifically, positive, strong and direct associations were found between negative affect and both positive and negative metacognitions about online gaming. Moreover, negative metacognitions about online gaming were strongly linked to PIU. Overall, the theoretical model was supported showing that metacognitions about online gaming may play a role in the association between time spent on online gaming to a broader pattern of PIU. Results are discussed within the context of the metacognitive model of psychopathology and clinical implications based on this model are outlined.

Multiple community threats may also have cumulative impact on mental health, so examination across several contexts is important. The objective of this study is to report on changes in mental health and well-being in response to the Australian bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized an Experience-Sampling-Method (ESM), using the smartphone-based mood monitoring application, MoodPrism. Participants were prompted once a day to complete a brief survey inquiring about symptoms of depression and anxiety, and several well-being indices, including arousal, emotional valence, self-esteem, motivation, social connectedness, meaning and purpose, and control. Participants were N = 755 Australians (aged 13 years and above) who downloaded and used MoodPrism, between 2018 and 2020. Results showed that anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not during the bushfires. This may be explained by concurrent feelings of social connectedness maintained during the bushfires but not during the pandemic. In contrast, depressive symptoms increased significantly during the bushfires, which maintained during the pandemic. Most indices of well-being decreased significantly during the bushfires, and further again during the pandemic. Study findings highlight the unique responses to the bushfire and COVID-19 crises, revealing specific areas of resilience and vulnerability. Such information can help inform the development of public health interventions or individual clinical treatment, to improve treatment approaches and preparedness for potential future community disasters.

Results from an ecological momentary assessment study,"Hjartarson, Kristján Helgi;Snorrason, Ivar;Bringmann, Laura F.;Ögmundsson, Bjarni E.;Ólafsson, Ragnar P.",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,2020.2.20,Scholarly Journals,English,"It has been suggested that mental habits may underpin a heightened disposition to engage in rumination in response to negative mood. The aim of the current study was to assess the role of habit in the dynamic interplay between affect and ruminative thinking in the flow of daily life experiences. Using mobile ecological momentary assessment, 97 participants recorded affect and rumination ten times daily over six days, after completing measures of trait ruminative brooding and habitual characteristics of negative thinking (e.g. automaticity, lack of conscious awareness, intent and control). Momentary fluctuations in negative (increased) and positive (decreased) affect was prospectively associated with greater rumination-levels at the next sampling occasion. The degree to which affect triggered a subsequent ruminative response was moderated by habitual characteristics of negative thinking in a theoretically consistent way. Stronger temporal pairing of negative affect and rumination was also associated with greater emotional inertia but less carry-over of rumination from one moment to the next. Depression vulnerability may be in the form of rumination being habitually triggered in response to momentary fluctuations in affect, with deleterious effect on mood. The findings may have clinical implications, as targeting the habitual nature of rumination might help reduce depression vulnerability.

Methods: Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 78 subjects with IGD (39 males, 20.8 ± 2.16 years old) and 72 with recreational game use (RGU) (39 males, 21.5 ± 2.56 years old). By utilizing graph theory, we calculated participation coefficients among brain network modules for all participants and analyzed the diagnostic-group-by-gender interactions. We further explored possible causal relationships between networks through spectral dynamic causal modeling (spDCM) to assess differences in between-network connections. Results: Compared to males with RGU, males with IGD demonstrated reduced modular segregation of the frontal-parietal network (FPN). Male IGD subjects also showed increased connections between the FPN and cingulo-opercular network (CON); however, these differences were not found in female subjects. Further spDCM analysis indicated that the causal influence from CON to FPN in male IGD subjects was enhanced relative to that of RGU males, while this influence was relatively reduced in females with IGD. Conclusions: These results suggest poor modular segmentation of the FPN and abnormal FPN/CON connections in males with IGD, suggesting a mechanism for male vulnerability to IGD. An increased “bottom-up”effect from the CON to FPN in male IGD subjects could reflect dysfunction between the brain networks. Different mechanisms may underlie in IGD, suggesting that different interventions may be optimal in males and females with IGD.

However, there is also increasing evidence that many patients, especially those with mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, may struggle to utilize these apps given issues with usability and engagement. Further, there is a paucity of literature on differences in the preference for using technologies such as smartphone apps for mental health patients compared to other patient populations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preferences and use of technology for health information exchange within a nationally-representative sample of adults with and without mental illness and to assess whether these preferences differ according to sociodemographic factors. For our analysis, we utilized data from the 2017 (HINTS 5 cycle 1) and 2018 (HINTS 5 cycle 2) iterations of the Health Information National Trends Survey ( n = 6789). We used multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with a higher or lower rate of using health information technology (HIT) in persons with or without mental illness. We adjusted these models for the sociodemographic variables of age, sex, household income, education level, employment status, health insurance status, marital status, and race. Of the 6789 participants, 1538 reported having depression and/or an anxiety disorder. In both the adjusted and unadjusted models, ownership of smartphones, tablet computers, health apps, and utilization of the internet did not differ by depression or anxiety status. Furthermore, in the adjusted models, those with depression and/or anxiety had a significantly higher likelihood of using electronic means such as computers and smartphones to search for health information, look up test results, communicate with a physician, and to share health information. However, these individuals were also more likely to withhold information from their health care providers due to concerns about the security or privacy of their medical records. Our analysis shows that while ownership rates for smartphones and the use of health apps did not differ by mental health status, there was an increased likelihood of those with mental illness to use health information tools in communicating with their health providers. However, concerns about data security and privacy may hinder the utilization and integration of these technologies in mental health care.

10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.101515,Effects of awareness material featuring individuals with experience of depression and suicidal thoughts on an audience with depressive symptoms: Randomized controlled trial,"Niederkrotenthaler, Thomas;Till, Benedikt",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,2019.3.5,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and objective: Suicide prevention plans support individuals with personal experience of mental disorders and suicidality to provide their narratives of coping in the media. The evidence how such portrayals impact on individuals with similar symptoms is limited and there are concerns about unwanted side effects. Methods: This was a double-blinded randomized controlled online trial conducted from August to November 2018. N = 158 young adults aged 18–24 with current depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts were randomized to watch a short film featuring a young individual with personal experience of depression and suicidality ( n = 81), or a thematically unrelated control film ( n = 77) with similar stylistic elements. Questionnaire data were collected before and immediately after exposure and analysed with ANOVA. The primary outcome was suicidal ideation; secondary outcomes were depressed mood and help-seeking intentions. We also tested the moderating effects of the degree of depressive symptoms on the effects. Results: Depressed mood was significantly lower, with small-to medium effect size, in the intervention group compared to the control group ( F (1,111) = 4.13, P &lt; .05, η p ² = .036). There was no effect on suicidal ideation or help-seeking intentions in the total sample. Participants screening positive for moderately severe depression or higher experienced an increase in suicidal ideation in the control group. Limitations: Self-reported variables in an online setting. Conclusions: Videos featuring personal experience of coping with depression appear safe for young individuals with similar or higher symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation on the short run, and might have some benefits.

We examined the extent to which popular mental health applications (MH apps) for depression and anxiety contain treatment elements found in empirically supported psychotherapy protocols (i.e., “common elements”). Of the 27 MH apps reviewed, 23 included at least one common element, with a median of three elements. Psychoeducation (in 52% of apps), relaxation (44%), meditation (41%), mindfulness (37%), and assessment (37%) were the most frequent elements, whereas several elements (e.g., problem solving) were not found in any apps. We also identified gaps between app content and empirically supported treatments. Cognitive restructuring was more common in depression protocols than in depression apps (75% of protocols vs. 31% of apps), as was problem solving (34% vs. 0%). For anxiety, exposure (85%, 12%), cognitive restructuring (60%, 12%), and problem solving (25%, 0%) were more common in protocols than apps. Overall, our findings highlight empirically supported treatment elements that are poorly represented in current MH apps. The absence of several core treatment elements underscores the need for future research, including randomized trials testing the effectiveness of popular MH apps.

J.;Kerkhof, Ad J. F. M.;Mokkenstorm, Jan K.;Portzky, Gwendolyn",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,2018.9.10,Scholarly Journals,English,"Suicide is a major public health issue, and treatment of suicidal thoughts may contribute to its prevention. Provision of online treatment of suicidal ideation may reduce barriers that suicidal individuals experience in face-to-face treatment. We therefore aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based intervention targeting a reduction of suicidal ideation. We carried out a two-arm, parallel-design, randomised controlled trial in the general population in Flanders (Belgium) (registered as NCT03209544). Participants who were 18 years or older and experienced suicidal ideation were included. The intervention group (n = 365) received access to the unguided web-based intervention, and the control group (n = 359) was placed on a waitlist. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. Participants reported high levels of suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety at baseline. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group experienced a significant decline in suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, worrying, and anxiety both at post-test and at follow-up. An important limitation of the study was a high dropout rate, in particular in the intervention group. Our findings suggest that the online self-help intervention was more effective in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide-related symptoms than a waitlist control in a severely affected population. It can help in filling the gap between crisis help and face-to-face treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)"

A key characteristic of SCED is repeated, systematic assessment of outcome variables, which is critical to achieving high internal validity, collecting a sufficient number of observations to conduct adequately powered statistical analyses, capturing dynamic and fine-grained changes in outcomes, and tailoring interventions at the individual level. Recent advances in real-time monitoring technology, such as digital ecological momentary assessment, passive smartphone-based behavioral tracking, and physiological assessment with wearable biosensors, are extremely well-suited to conducting these repeated, systematic measurements. Here, we discuss the rationale for incorporating real-time data collection technologies within SCED and highlight how recent studies have paired SCED with real-time monitoring. We also present original data illustrating how real-time digital monitoring can provide an idiographic and granular view of behavior (in this case, suicidal ideation). Last, we discuss the challenges of, and offer our recommendations for, using real-time monitoring technologies in SCED research.

Simultaneously, there has been a steady rise in the demand for counseling services. These trends have been viewed by some as a mental health crisis requiring prompt investigation and the generation of potential solutions to serve the needs of students. Subsequently, several studies linked the observed rise in symptoms with the ubiquitous rise in use of personal computing technologies, including social media, and have suggested that time spent on these types of technologies is directly correlated with poor mental health. While use of personal computing technologies has dramatically shifted the landscape in which college students connect with one another and appears to have some detriments to mental health, the same technologies also offer a number of opportunities for the enhancement of mental health and the treatment of mental illness. Here, we describe the challenges and opportunities for college student mental health afforded by personal computing technologies. We highlight opportunities for new research in this area and possibilities for individuals and organizations to engage with these technologies in a more helpful and wellness-promoting manner.

A.;Möbius, Martin;Becker, Eni S.;Spijker, J.;Rinck, Mike",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,2017.3.1,Scholarly Journals,English,"Background and Objectives: The general positivity training, a Cognitive Bias Modification procedure modifying individuals' approach-avoidance tendencies to positively and negatively valenced pictures by means of a joystick task, has been proven effective in attenuating stress reactivity in dysphoric students. The present study explored which training component (pull positive pictures, push negative pictures, or both) is the active one in changing action tendencies and stress responses. Methods: Two-hundred-and-thirteen students completed one of four approach-avoidance trainings before being exposed to a stressful speech-task: The general positivity training (pull positive and push negative pictures), a training to approach positive pictures and avoid empty pictures (ApP), a training to avoid negative pictures and approach empty pictures (AvN), or a sham-training. Results: The pattern of results suggests that the groups trained to avoid negative pictures showed a stronger increase in positive approach-avoidance tendencies than the other two groups. However, only the positivity training induced significant within-group changes in positive bias. The groups further did not differ in self-report or cardiovascular measures of anxiety in response to the stress-task. Instead, the training affected mood directly: Exposure to negative pictures during the training increased state anxiety. Limitations: Generalizability of the findings is limited by using an unselected student sample. Also, the use of empty pictures as neutral stimuli in the ApP and AvN could have weakened training effects in these groups. Conclusions: Although our results hint at the importance of avoiding negative pictures for modifying an approach-avoidance bias, only the positivity training with both components may effectively induce a positive bias. Remarkably, we failed to replicate and extend previously reported effects of the training on stress-responses. Hence, it remains questionable whether the changes in bias reflect changes in underlying cognitive processing tendencies or task-specific learning effects.

10.1016/j.brat.2017.07.006,Rumination interacts with life stress to predict depressive symptoms: An ecological momentary assessment study,"Connolly, Samantha L.;Alloy, Lauren B.",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,2017.1.4,Scholarly Journals,English,"Rumination is a well-established vulnerability factor for depression that may exert deleterious effects both independently and in interaction with stress. The current study examined momentary ruminative self-focus (MRS) and stress-reactive rumination (SRR) as predictors of depressive symptoms utilizing a smartphone ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design. 121 undergraduates responded to four text message alerts per day for one week in which they indicated the occurrence of life stress, rumination, and depressed mood. SRR, but not MRS, independently predicted increases in depressive symptoms. MRS interacted with depressive symptoms to predict increases in symptoms at the subsequent timepoint, supporting the deleterious effects of depressive rumination on future mood state. Interactions emerged between stress and both MRS and SRR, such that experiencing higher levels of stressors and rumination at an observation predicted greater increases in depressive symptoms. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that state rumination moderates the effect of stress in predicting depressive symptoms using EMA methodology. Results suggest that rumination levels in response to stress vary within individuals and can have an important effect on depressed mood. Findings may have important clinical implications, as lessening individuals’ tendency to engage in rumination following stress may help to alleviate depressive symptoms.

Freeman;Kokoszka, Andrzej",Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy,,,Scholarly Journals,English,"Aims: To examine whether Polish women with type 2 diabetes suffer from sexual dysfunction/dissatisfaction, and if so, to investigate an association between the severity of sexual problems and well-being, anxiety and depression in this group. Material and Methods: We surveyed 60 women aged 42–76 years (M = 59.25, SD = 9.14), using the following questionnaires: the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), Sexological Questionnaire Part B, the WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and the Brief Self-Rating Scale of Depression and Anxiety. Results: Two-thirds of respondents (75%, N = 45) complained that they did not experience orgasm (anorgasmia), 63.3% (N = 38) showed a lack or loss of sexual desire, and 50% (N = 30) had no genital response to sexual stimuli and/or experienced sex aversion. There was no significant relationship between well-being, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and the severity of sexual dysfunction. Discussion: Our findings indicate that sexual dysfunction is more prevalent than shown in other studies, but the study had significant limitations due to a small number of participants and lack of a pair-matched control group. The findings should be interpreted with caution and it would be important to confirm these results in future studies, with a larger group of participants. Conclusions: Polish women with type 2 diabetes commonly experience symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Wellbeing, depressive and anxiety symptoms appear to co-occur with symptoms of sexual dysfunction.

The system was specifically designed to be usable by people with psychotic disorders who may have cognitive impairment, psychotic symptoms, negative symptoms, and/or low reading levels. FOCUS offers users both prescheduled and on-demand resources to facilitate symptom management, mood regulation, medication adherence, social functioning, and improved sleep. In this study, 33 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder used FOCUS over a 1- month period in their own environments. Participants were able to learn how to use the intervention independently, and all but one participant completed the trial successfully and returned the smartphones intact. Completers used the system on 86.5% of days they had the device, an average of 5.2 times a day. Approximately 62% of use of the FOCUS intervention was initiated by the participants, and 38% of use was in response to automated prompts. Baseline levels of cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, persecutory ideation, and reading level were not related to participants’ use of the intervention. Approximately 90% of participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable and usable. Paired samples t tests found significant reductions in psychotic symptoms, depression, and general psychopathology, after 1 month of FOCUS use. This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the FOCUS intervention for schizophrenia and introduces a new treatment model which has promise for extending the reach of evidence-based care beyond the confines of a physical clinic using widely available technologies.

Dysfunctional appraisal of these symptoms may exacerbate the disorder, and conversely may lead to further intrusive memories. This raises the intriguing possibility that learning to ‘reappraise’ potential symptoms more functionally may protect against such symptoms.Woud, Holmes, Postma, Dalgleish, and Mackintosh (2012) found that ‘reappraisal training’ when delivered after an analogue stressful event reduced later intrusive memories and other posttraumatic symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate whether reappraisal training administered before a stressful event is also beneficial. Methods: Participants first received positive or negative reappraisal training (CBM-App training) using a series of scripted vignettes. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a film with traumatic content. Effects of the CBM-App training procedure were assessed via three distinct outcome measures, namely: (a) post-training appraisals of novel ambiguous vignettes, (b) change scores on the Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), and (c) intrusive symptom diary. Results: CBM-App training successfully induced training-congruent appraisal styles. Moreover, those trained positively reported less distress arising from their intrusive memories of the trauma film during the subsequent week than those trained negatively. However, the induced appraisal bias only partly affected PTCI scores. Limitations: Participants used their own negative event as a reference for the PTCI assessments. The events may have differed regarding their emotional impact. There was no control group. Conclusions: CBM-App training has also some beneficial effects when applied before a stressful event and may serve as a cognitive prophylaxis against trauma-related symptomatology.

The aim of the present study was to identify specific associations among symptom severity of depression, early maladaptive schemas and recognition patterns of facially expressed emotions. Methods: The subjects were inpatients, diagnosed with depression. We used 2 virtual humans for presenting the basic emotions to assess emotion recognition. The Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90) was used as a self-report measure of psychiatric symptoms and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was applied to assess symptoms of depression. The Young Schema Questionnaire Long Form (YSQ-L) was used to assess the presence of early maladaptive schemas. Results: The recognition rate for happiness showed significant associations with both the BDI and the depression subscale of the SCL-90. After performing the second order factor analysis of the YSQ-L, we found statistically significant associations between the recognition indices of specific emotions and the main factors of the YSQ-L. Conclusions: In this study we found correlations between maladaptive schemas and emotion recognition impairments. While both domains likely contribute to the symptoms of depression, we believe that the results will help us to better understand the social cognitive deficits of depressed patients at the schema level and at the emotion recognition level.

Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via the Web and apps, offer the potential to improve access to mental health treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the literature on digital mental health interventions focused on depression, anxiety, and enhancement of psychological well-being among samples of college students to identify the effectiveness, usability, acceptability, uptake, and adoption of such programs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (registration number CRD42018092800), and the search strategy was conducted by a medical research librarian in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EbscoHost), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) from the date of inception to April 2019. Data were synthesized using a systematic narrative synthesis framework, and formal quality assessments were conducted to address the risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 89 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions (71/89, 80%) were delivered via a website, and the most common intervention was internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (28, 31%). Many programs (33, 37%) featured human support in the form of coaching. The majority of programs were either effective (42, 47%) or partially effective (30, 34%) in producing beneficial changes in the main psychological outcome variables. Approximately half of the studies (45, 51%) did not present any usability or acceptability outcomes, and few studies (4, 4%) examined a broad implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses. Quality assessments revealed a moderate-to-severe risk of bias in many of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that digital mental health interventions can be effective for improving depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being among college students, but more rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the effective elements of these interventions. Continued research on improving the user experience of, and thus user engagement with, these programs appears vital for the sustainable implementation of digital mental health interventions on college campuses."

However, iCBT programmes include training in a wide array of cognitive and behavioural skills via different delivery methods, and it remains unclear which of these components are more efficacious and for whom. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual participant data component network meta-analysis (cNMA) of iCBT trials for depression. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to Jan 1, 2019, that compared any form of iCBT against another or a control condition in the acute treatment of adults (aged ≥18 years) with depression. Studies with inpatients or patients with bipolar depression were excluded. We sought individual participant data from the original authors. When these data were unavailable, we used aggregate data. Two independent researchers identified the included components. The primary outcome was depression severity, expressed as incremental mean difference (iMD) in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores when a component is added to a treatment. We developed a web app that estimates relative efficacies between any two combinations of components, given baseline patient characteristics. This study is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018104683. FINDINGS: We identified 76 RCTs, including 48 trials contributing individual participant data (11 704 participants) and 28 trials with aggregate data (6474 participants). The participants' weighted mean age was 42·0 years and 12 406 (71%) of 17 521 reported were women. There was suggestive evidence that behavioural activation might be beneficial (iMD -1·83 [95% credible interval (CrI) -2·90 to -0·80]) and that relaxation might be harmful (1·20 [95% CrI 0·17 to 2·27]). Baseline severity emerged as the strongest prognostic factor for endpoint depression. Combining human and automated encouragement reduced dropouts from treatment (incremental odds ratio, 0·32 [95% CrI 0·13 to 0·93]). The risk of bias was low for the randomisation process, missing outcome data, or selection of reported results in most of the included studies, uncertain for deviation from intended interventions, and high for measurement of outcomes. There was moderate to high heterogeneity among the studies and their components. INTERPRETATION: The individual patient data cNMA revealed potentially helpful, less helpful, or harmful components and delivery formats for iCBT packages. iCBT packages aiming to be effective and efficient might choose to include beneficial components and exclude ones that are potentially detrimental. Our web app can facilitate shared decision making by therapist and patient in choosing their preferred iCBT package. FUNDING: Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."

Health promotion during adolescence has been shown to contribute to the prevention of late onset of the mental health disease. However, scalable interventions have not been established yet. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to test the efficacy of two adolescent health promotion interventions: a well-care visit (WCV) with a risk assessment interview and counseling and self-monitoring with a smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app. Our hypothesis was that participants who had received both WCV and the CBT app would have better outcomes than those who had received only WCV or those who had not received any intervention. We conducted a prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants were 217 adolescents aged 13-18 years. They were randomly divided into two intervention groups (WCV group and WCV with CBT app group) and a nonintervention group. WCV comprised a standardized physical examination along with a structured interview and counseling for youth risk assessment, which was designed with reference to the Guideline for Health Supervision of Adolescents of Bright Futures. A smartphone-based CBT program was developed based on the CBT approach. The CBT app comprised a 1-week psychoeducation component and a 1-week self-monitoring component. During the CBT program, participants created several self-monitoring sheets based on the CBT model with five window panels: event, thoughts, feelings, body response, and actions. The primary outcome was the change in scores for depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in scores for self-esteem, quality of life, self-monitoring, and an adolescent health promotion scale. These outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 months after baseline. The exploratory outcome was the presence of suicidal ideation during the observation period. Intervention effects were estimated using mixed effect models. RESULTS: In total, 94% (204/217) of the participants completed the 4-month evaluation. Both intervention groups showed a significant effect in the form of reduced scores for depressive symptoms at 1 month in high school students; however, these effects were not observed at 2 and 4 months. The intervention effect was significantly more predominant in those scoring above cutoff for depressive symptoms. There was significantly less suicidal ideation in the intervention groups. As for secondary outcomes, there was significant increase in health promotion scale scores at the 4-month follow-up among junior high school students in the WCV group. Moreover, the CBT app was significantly effective in terms of obtaining self-monitoring skills and reducing depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Although adolescent health promotion interventions may have short-term benefits, the frequency of WCV and further revision of the CBT app should be considered to evaluate long-term effectiveness.

One potential health behavior intervention that has been shown to be effective for improving mental health is exercise, which may be facilitated by taking advantage of mobile application (app) technologies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which a 12-week app-based exercise intervention can reduce depressive symptoms, burnout, and absenteeism in HCWs, compared with a wait list control condition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted, with participants screened from April 6 to July 4, 2022. Participants were recruited from an urban health care organization in British Columbia, Canada. Participants completed measures before randomization and every 2 weeks thereafter. INTERVENTIONS: Exercise condition participants were asked to complete four 20-minute sessions per week using a suite of body weight interval training, yoga, barre, and running apps. Wait-listed control participants received the apps at the end of the trial. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome consisted of the between-group difference in depressive symptoms measured with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes corresponded to 3 subfacets of burnout (cynicism, emotional exhaustion, and professional efficacy) and absenteeism. Intention-to-treat analyses were completed with multilevel structural equation modeling, and Feingold effect sizes (ES) were estimated every 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 288 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.0 [10.8] years; 246 [85.4%] women) were randomized to either exercise (n = 142) or wait list control (n = 146) conditions. Results revealed that ESs for depressive symptoms were in the small to medium range by trial's end (week 12, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.13]). Significant and consistent treatment effects were revealed for 2 facets of burnout, namely cynicism (week 12 ES, -0.33 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.13]) and emotional exhaustion (week 12 ES, -0.39 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.14]), as well as absenteeism (r = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.03-0.26]). Adherence to the 80 minutes per week of exercise decreased from 78 (54.9%) to 33 (23.2%) participants between weeks 2 and 12. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although exercise was able to reduce depressive symptoms among HCWs, adherence was low toward the end of the trial. Optimizing adherence to exercise programming represents an important challenge to help maintain improvements in mental health among HCWs.

We investigated the efficacy of smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation applications in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: This was a decentralized randomized trial. Participants were disease-free breast cancer survivors age 20-49 years who were randomly assigned to the smartphone-based intervention or waitlist control. Both groups received treatment as usual. The control group could access the smartphone apps during weeks 8-24. The intervention comprised smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation apps. The primary end point was the Concerns About Recurrence Scale at week 8. Secondary outcomes included the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory at weeks 8 and 24 (trial registration: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000031140). RESULTS: The intervention group included 223 participants, and the control group included 224 participants. Primary outcome data were obtained for 444 participants, and 213 participants in the intervention arm completed the week 24 assessment. The intervention group had statistically greater improvements than controls at week 8 on the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (difference -1.39; 95% CI, -1.93 to -0.85; P < .001), FCRI-SF (difference -1.65; 95% CI, -2.41 to -0.89; P < .001), HADS depression (difference -0.49; 95% CI, -0.98 to 0; P < .05), and SCNS-SF34 psychological domain (difference -1.49; 95% CI, -2.67 to -0.32; P < .05). These scores at week 24 were not statistically significant compared with week 8 although the HADS depression score at week 24 was significantly reduced (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Novel smartphone psychotherapy offers a promising way to reduce FCR given the large number of survivors and a limited number of therapists to competently conduct psychotherapy."

IMPORTANCE: Depression is a leading contributor to disease burden globally. Digital mental health interventions can address the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries, but the effectiveness in these countries is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a digital intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among people with diabetes and/or hypertension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score ≥10) who were being treated for hypertension and/or diabetes were enrolled in a cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) at 20 sites in São Paulo, Brazil (N=880; from September 2016 to September 2017; final follow-up, April 2018), and in an individual-level RCT at 7 sites in Lima, Peru (N=432; from January 2017 to September 2017; final follow-up, March 2018). INTERVENTIONS: An 18-session, low-intensity, digital intervention was delivered over 6 weeks via a provided smartphone, based on behavioral activation principles, and supported by nurse assistants (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 217 participants in Lima) vs enhanced usual care (n = 440 participants in 10 clusters in São Paulo; n = 215 participants in Lima). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 50% from baseline in PHQ-9 scores (range, 0-27; higher score indicates more severe depression) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included a reduction of at least 50% from baseline PHQ-9 scores at 6 months. RESULTS: Among 880 patients cluster randomized in Brazil (mean age, 56.0 years; 761 [86.5%] women) and 432 patients individually randomized in Peru (mean age, 59.7 years; 352 [81.5%] women), 807 (91.7%) in Brazil and 426 (98.6%) in Peru completed at least 1 follow-up assessment. The proportion of participants in São Paulo with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 40.7% (159/391 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 28.6% (114/399 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 12.1 percentage points [95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2]; P = .001). In Lima, the proportion of participants with a reduction in PHQ-9 score of at least 50% at 3-month follow-up was 52.7% (108/205 participants) in the digital intervention group vs 34.1% (70/205 participants) in the enhanced usual care group (difference, 18.6 percentage points [95% CI, 9.1 to 28.0]; adjusted OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.4 to 3.2]; P < .001). At 6-month follow-up, differences across groups were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 2 RCTs of patients with hypertension or diabetes and depressive symptoms in Brazil and Peru, a digital intervention delivered over a 6-week period significantly improved depressive symptoms at 3 months when compared with enhanced usual care. However, the magnitude of the effect was small in the trial from Brazil and the effects were not sustained at 6 months.

Few studies have investigated the use of mobile technology to prevent postpartum depression in women. This study investigated the preliminary effectiveness of the CareMom program, a new app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program, on reducing the depressive symptoms of mothers during the very early postpartum period via a pilot randomized controlled study. The participants were recruited during birth hospitalization (within 3 days after giving birth) and randomized to the waiting-list control and CareMom groups. Over the four-week intervention period, the CareMom group was required to complete 28 daily challenges via CareMom. The depressive (via EPDS) and anxiety (via GAD-7) levels of participants were measured at baseline and every 7 days postbaseline for 4 weeks. A total of 112 eligible participants were randomly allocated to the two groups (CareMom: n = 57; control: n = 55). At week 4, the CareMom group achieved a significantly lower EPDS score than the control group at week 4 (p = 0.037). In addition, the EPDS (p < 0.001) scores of the CareMom group were significantly lower than the baseline values. However, the control group did not show any significant reduction in this measure. No significant reduction of GAD-7 scores was observed for CareMom and control groups at week 4. This study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of CareMom in reducing depressive symptoms in the general postpartum population during the very early postpartum period."

However, mental health services remain scarce and underutilized worldwide. Mental health chatbots are a novel digital technology to provide fully automated interventions for depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the clinical effectiveness and nonclinical performance of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health chatbot (XiaoE) for young adults with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a single-blind, 3-arm randomized controlled trial, participants manifesting depressive symptoms recruited from a Chinese university were randomly assigned to a mental health chatbot (XiaoE; n=49), an e-book (n=49), or a general chatbot (Xiaoai; n=50) group in a ratio of 1:1:1. Participants received a 1-week intervention. The primary outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms according to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 1 week later (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted under analysis of covariance models adjusting for baseline data. Controlled multiple imputation and δ-based sensitivity analysis were performed for missing data. The secondary outcomes were the level of working alliance measured using the Working Alliance Questionnaire (WAQ), usability measured using the Usability Metric for User Experience-LITE (UMUX-LITE), and acceptability measured using the Acceptability Scale (AS). RESULTS: Participants were on average 18.78 years old, and 37.2% (55/148) were female. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 10.02 (SD 3.18; range 2-19). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed lower PHQ-9 scores among participants in the XiaoE group compared with participants in the e-book group and Xiaoai group at both T1 (F2,136=17.011; P<.001; d=0.51) and T2 (F2,136=5.477; P=.005; d=0.31). Better working alliance (WAQ; F2,145=3.407; P=.04) and acceptability (AS; F2,145=4.322; P=.02) were discovered with XiaoE, while no significant difference among arms was found for usability (UMUX-LITE; F2,145=0.968; P=.38). CONCLUSIONS: A CBT-based chatbot is a feasible and engaging digital therapeutic approach that allows easy accessibility and self-guided mental health assistance for young adults with depressive symptoms. A systematic evaluation of nonclinical metrics for a mental health chatbot has been established in this study. In the future, focus on both clinical outcomes and nonclinical metrics is necessary to explore the mechanism by which mental health chatbots work on patients. Further evidence is required to confirm the long-term effectiveness of the mental health chatbot via trails replicated with a longer dose, as well as exploration of its stronger efficacy in comparison with other active controls.

10.1002/wps.21183,Current evidence on the efficacy of mental health smartphone apps for symptoms of depression and anxiety. A meta-analysis of 176 randomized controlled trials,"Linardon J, Torous J, Firth J, Cuijpers P, Messer M, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M.",World Psychiatry,2024,2024.1.12,,,"The mental health care available for depression and anxiety has recently undergone a major technological revolution, with growing interest towards the potential of smartphone apps as a scalable tool to treat these conditions. Since the last comprehensive meta-analysis in 2019 established positive yet variable effects of apps on depressive and anxiety symptoms, more than 100 new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been carried out. We conducted an updated meta-analysis with the objectives of providing more precise estimates of effects, quantifying generalizability from this evidence base, and understanding whether major app and trial characteristics moderate effect sizes. We included 176 RCTs that aimed to treat depressive or anxiety symptoms. Apps had overall significant although small effects on symptoms of depression (N=33,567, g=0.28, p<0.001; number needed to treat, NNT=11.5) and generalized anxiety (N=22,394, g=0.26, p<0.001, NNT=12.4) as compared to control groups. These effects were robust at different follow-ups and after removing small sample and higher risk of bias trials. There was less variability in outcome scores at post-test in app compared to control conditions (ratio of variance, RoV=-0.14, 95% CI: -0.24 to -0.05 for depressive symptoms; RoV=-0.21, 95% CI: -0.31 to -0.12 for generalized anxiety symptoms). Effect sizes for depression were significantly larger when apps incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) features or included chatbot technology. Effect sizes for anxiety were significantly larger when trials had generalized anxiety as a primary target and administered a CBT app or an app with mood monitoring features. We found evidence of moderate effects of apps on social anxiety (g=0.52) and obsessive-compulsive (g=0.51) symptoms, a small effect on post-traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.12), a large effect on acrophobia symptoms (g=0.90), and a non-significant negative effect on panic symptoms (g=-0.12), although these results should be considered with caution, because most trials had high risk of bias and were based on small sample sizes. We conclude that apps have overall small but significant effects on symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety, and that specific features of apps - such as CBT or mood monitoring features and chatbot technology - are associated with larger effect sizes."

Smartphone-based treatment is a low-cost, convenient alternative modality. This study evaluated a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in alleviating major depression and insomnia. METHODS: A parallel-group randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted with 320 adults with major depression and insomnia. Participants were randomized to receive either a 6-week CBT-I via a smartphone application, proACT-S, or waitlist condition. The primary outcomes included depression severity, insomnia severity, and sleep quality. The secondary outcomes included anxiety severity, subjective health, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments were administered at baseline, post-intervention (week 6) follow-up, and week 12 follow-up. The waitlist group received treatment after the week 6 follow-up. RESULTS: Intention to treat analysis was conducted with multilevel modeling. In all but one model, the interaction between treatment condition and time at week 6 follow-up was significant. Compared with the waitlist group, the treatment group had lower levels of depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): Cohen's d = 0.86, 95% CI (-10.11 to -5.37)], insomnia [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): Cohen's d = 1.00, 95% CI (-5.93 to -3.53)], and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A): Cohen's d = 0.83, 95% CI (-3.75 to -1.96)]. They also had better sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Cohen's d = 0.91, 95% CI (-3.34 to -1.83)]. No differences across any measures were found at week 12, after the waitlist control group received the treatment.

IMPORTANCE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is moderately effective for depression when applied by trained staff. It is not known whether self-applied tDCS, combined or not with a digital psychological intervention, is also effective. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fully unsupervised home-use tDCS, combined with a digital psychological intervention or digital placebo, is effective for a major depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial with 3 arms: (1) home-use tDCS plus a digital psychological intervention (double active); (2) home-use tDCS plus digital placebo (tDCS only), and (3) sham home-use tDCS plus digital placebo (double sham). The study was conducted between April 2021 and October 2022 at participants' homes and at Instituto de Psiquiatria do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. Included participants were aged 18 to 59 years with major depression and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17-item version (HDRS-17), score above 16, a minimum of 8 years of education, and access to a smartphone and internet at home. Exclusion criteria were other psychiatric disorders, except for anxiety; neurologic or clinical disorders; and tDCS contraindications. INTERVENTIONS: tDCS was administered in 2-mA, 30-minute prefrontal sessions for 15 consecutive weekdays (1-mA, 90-second duration for sham) and twice-weekly sessions for 3 weeks. The digital intervention consisted of 46 sessions based on behavioral therapy. Digital placebo was internet browsing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in HDRS-17 score at week 6. RESULTS: Of 837 volunteers screened, 210 participants were enrolled (180 [86%] female; mean [SD] age, 38.9 [9.3] years) and allocated to double active (n = 64), tDCS only (n = 73), or double sham (n = 73). Of the 210 participants enrolled, 199 finished the trial. Linear mixed-effects models did not reveal statistically significant group differences in treatment by time interactions for HDRS-17 scores, and the estimated effect sizes between groups were as follows: double active vs tDCS only (Cohen d, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.48 to 0.58; P = .86), double active vs double sham (Cohen d, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.73 to 0.34; P = .47), and tDCS only vs double sham (Cohen d, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.76 to 0.27; P = .35). Skin redness and heat or burning sensations were more frequent in the double active and tDCS only groups. One nonfatal suicide attempt occurred in the tDCS only group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unsupervised home-use tDCS combined with a digital psychological intervention or digital placebo was not found to be superior to sham for treatment of a major depressive episode in this trial.

As depressive disorders affect many people worldwide, internet-based behavioral activation (iBA) could provide enhanced treatment access. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether iBA is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and to assess the impact on secondary outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and CENTRAL up to December 2021 for eligible randomized controlled trials. In addition, a reference search was conducted. Title and abstract screening, as well as a full-text screening, was conducted by 2 independent reviewers. Randomized controlled trials that investigated the effectiveness of iBA for depression as a treatment or main component were included. Randomized controlled trials had to report depressive symptoms, with a quantitative outcome measure and assess an adult population with depressive symptoms above cutoff. Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Data were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. The primary outcome was self-reported depressive symptoms posttreatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials, with 3274 participants (88% female, 43.61 years) were included. iBA was more effective in reducing depressive symptom severity posttreatment than inactive control groups (standardized mean difference -0.49; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.34; P<.001). The overall level of heterogeneity was moderate to substantial (I2=53%). No significant effect of iBA on depressive symptoms could be found at 6-month follow-up. Participants assigned to iBA also experienced a significant reduction of anxiety and a significant increase in quality of life and activation compared to the inactive control groups. The results remained robust in multiple sensitivity analyses. The risk of bias assessment revealed at least some concerns for all studies, and there was evidence of slight publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis implies that iBA is effective in reducing depressive symptoms. It represents a promising treatment option, providing treatment access where no treatment is available yet.

10.2196/52609,Acceptability of Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review,"Lau CKY, Saad A, Camara B, Rahman D, Bolea-Alamanac B.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.10.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders are common, and treatment often includes psychological interventions. Digital health interventions, delivered through technologies such as web-based programs and mobile apps, are increasingly used in mental health treatment. Acceptability, the extent to which an intervention is viewed positively, has been identified as contributing to patient adherence and engagement with digital health interventions. Acceptability, therefore, impacts the benefit derived from using digital health interventions in treatment. Understanding the acceptability of digital mental health interventions among patients with depression or anxiety disorders is essential to maximize the effectiveness of their treatment. OBJECTIVE: This review investigated the acceptability of technology-based interventions among patients with depression or anxiety disorders. METHODS: A systematic review was performed based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid in May 2022. Studies were included if they evaluated digital interventions for the treatment of depression or anxiety disorders and investigated their acceptability among adult patients. Studies were excluded if they targeted only specific populations (eg, those with specific physical health conditions), investigated acceptability in healthy individuals or patients under the age of 18 years, involved no direct interaction between patients and technologies, used technology only as a platform for traditional care (eg, videoconferencing), had patients using technologies only in clinical or laboratory settings, or involved virtual reality technologies. Acceptability outcome data were narratively synthesized by the direction of acceptability using vote counting. Included studies were evaluated using levels of evidence from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The risk of bias was assessed using a tool designed for this review and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). RESULTS: A total of 143 articles met the inclusion criteria, comprising 67 (47%) articles on interventions for depression, 65 (45%) articles on interventions for anxiety disorders, and 11 (8%) articles on interventions for both. Overall, 90 (63%) were randomized controlled trials, 50 (35%) were other quantitative studies, and 3 (2%) were qualitative studies. Interventions used web-based programs, mobile apps, and computer programs. Cognitive behavioral therapy was the basis of 71% (102/143) of the interventions. Digital mental health interventions were generally acceptable among patients with depression or anxiety disorders, with 88% (126/143) indicating positive acceptability, 8% (11/143) mixed results, and 4% (6/143) insufficient information to categorize the direction of acceptability. The available research evidence was of moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: Digital mental health interventions seem to be acceptable to patients with depression or anxiety disorders. Consistent use of validated measures for acceptability would enhance the quality of evidence. Careful design of acceptability as an evaluation outcome can further improve the quality of evidence and reduce the risk of bias.

10.1093/sleep/zsad104,Does insomnia treatment prevent depression?,"Boland EM, Goldschmied JR, Gehrman PR.",Sleep,2023,2023.4.8,,,"Rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) are increasing globally, in part due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, contributing to disease burden. It has long been known that insomnia is intricately connected with depression as indicated by greater depression severity and lower treatment response. Furthermore, insomnia is a significant risk factor for new-onset depression. Treatment of insomnia is thus a logical target for prevention of incidents and recurrent MDD. This systematic review sought to evaluate the current evidence for the preventive effects of insomnia treatment on depression onset. A database search yielded 186 studies, six of which met criteria for inclusion in this review. All of the studies utilized cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) as the target intervention and most delivered treatment via a digital platform. Four of the studies found significantly lower rates of MDD onset in those who received CBT-I compared to a control condition. The two remaining studies failed to confirm these effects in primary analyses but secondary analyses suggested evidence of a preventive effect. There was significant methodologic heterogeneity across studies in terms of sample selection, outcomes, and follow-up periods, limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions. The evidence overall is in the direction of insomnia treatment reducing the risk for onset of MDD, but further research is warranted.

10.2196/40937,Digital Behavioral Activation Interventions During the Perinatal Period: Scoping Review,"Mancinelli E, Dell'Arciprete G, Pattarozzi D, Gabrielli S, Salcuni S.",JMIR Pediatr Parent,2023,2023.2.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a complex period that implies many biopsychosocial changes, and the way women adapt to these changes impacts their well-being and the chances of developing mental health problems. During the perinatal period, women have expressed a preference for support delivered on the web. In this regard, interventions such as behavioral activation (BA), which are brief and structured psychosocial interventions, seem particularly suited to be delivered through digital solutions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to map the literature investigating digital BA interventions deployed during the perinatal period. We paid particular attention to the methodological underpinnings of the studies, the potential impact of BA interventions on symptoms other than depression, and the existence of differences occurring when these interventions were administered during pregnancy versus the postpartum period. METHODS: A systematic search compliant with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines was conducted considering 5 bibliographic databases; reference lists and key journals were also screened by 2 independent authors following a double-blind approach. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies published between 2013 and 2022 were included. In total, 2 studies were protocols for randomized controlled trials, 5 were empirical studies, and 1 was a qualitative study. All studies focused on the postpartum period, except for 1 that focused on the broader perinatal period. Promising effects on depression symptoms were reported but not on other psychosocial symptoms. Low intervention adherence has emerged, whereas the usability associated with the digital means used to deploy interventions was scarcely addressed; moreover, information on the digital platforms used was poorly reported overall. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the scarcity and preliminary nature of digital BA interventions deployed during the perinatal period, where the focus seems more on treatment rather than prevention. Moreover, future studies should also consider and address usability and user engagement, given their relevance to intervention efficacy."

As smartphones become increasingly accessible around the world, there is an opportunity to explore innovative mHealth tools for the prevention, screening, and management of perinatal depression. We completed a scoping review of the literature pertaining to the use of mobile phone technologies for perinatal depression in low-and middle-income countries. PubMed CINHAL, and Google Scholar databases were searched, generating 423 results. 12 articles met our inclusion criteria. Two of the 12 articles reviewed mobile phone applications. The remaining 9 articles were study protocols or descriptive/intervention studies. Our results reveal that minimal literature is currently available on the use of mobile health for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries. We found four articles that present the results of an intervention that were delivered through mobile phones for the treatment of perinatal depressive symptoms and an additional qualitative study describing the perceptions of mothers receiving cognitive behavioral therapy via telephones. These studies demonstrated that depressive symptoms improved after the interventions. There is potential to improve the quality of mHealth interventions, specifically mobile phone applications for perinatal depressive symptoms and depression, through meaningful collaborative work between healthcare professionals and application developers."

We assessed the efficacy of Motherly, a standalone CBT-based smartphone app, in reducing symptoms of postpartum depression. METHODS: Women aged 18-40 with symptoms of postpartum depression were randomized either to intervention (Motherly app) or active control (COMVC app). The primary outcome was symptoms of depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, parental stress, quality of sleep, behavioral activation, availability of response-contingent positive reinforcement, and clinical improvement at post-treatment and 1-month follow-up. Exploratory analyses were performed to investigate if app engagement was associated with treatment response. RESULTS: From November 2021 to August 2022, 1,751 women volunteered, of which 264 were randomized, and 215 provided primary outcome data. No statistically significant differences were found between groups at post-treatment: intervention: mean (SD): 12.75 (5.52); active control: 13.28 (5.32); p = 0.604. There was a statistically significant effect of the intervention on some of the secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses suggest a dose-response relationship between Motherly app engagement and outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our standalone app intervention did not significantly reduce postnatal depression symptoms when compared to active control. Exploratory findings suggest that negative findings might be associated with insufficient app engagement. Consistent with current literature, our findings suggest that standalone app interventions for postpartum depression are not ready to be implemented in clinical practice."

Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effective for reducing depressive symptoms among patients with cancer, but most patients prefer psychotherapy. This study aimed to develop an efficient and effective smartphone psychotherapy component to address depressive symptom. METHODS: This was a decentralized, parallel-group, multicenter, open, individually randomized, fully factorial trial. Patients aged ≥20 years with cancer were randomized by the presence/absence of three cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skills (behavioral activation [BA], assertiveness training [AT], and problem-solving [PS]) on a smartphone app. All participants received psychoeducation (PE). The primary outcome was change in the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score between baseline and week 8. Secondary outcomes included anxiety. RESULTS: In total, 359 participants were randomized. Primary outcome data at week 8 were obtained for 355 participants (99%). The week 8 PHQ-9 total score was significantly reduced from baseline for all participants by -1.41 points (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.89, -0.92), but between-group differences in change scores were not significant (BA: -0.04, 95% CI -0.75, 0.67; AT: -0.16, 95% CI -0.87, 0.55; PS: -0.19, 95% CI -0.90, 0.52). CONCLUSION: As the presence of any of the three intervention components did not contribute to a significant additive reduction of depressive symptoms, we cannot make evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of specific smartphone psychotherapy."

Despite the availability of treatment options, depression during pregnancy is often undertreated. Most pregnant women prefer nonpharmacological interventions over antidepressant medications. We review the evidence base for psychotherapeutic treatment approaches to depression during pregnancy. Treatments reviewed include interpersonal therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. We review both traditional face-to-face delivery and digital interventions. We conclude with recommendations for treatment preferences, collaborative decision-making, and strategies to improve uptake of such services among prenatal women."

While newly developed digital CBT approaches hold important advantages due to higher accessibility, their relative effectiveness compared to traditional CBT remains unclear. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify all studies that conducted a CBT-based intervention (face-to-face or digital) in patients with major depression. Random-effects meta-analytic models of the standardized mean change using raw score standardization (SMCR) were computed. In 106 studies including n = 11854 patients face-to-face CBT shows superior clinical effectiveness compared to digital CBT when investigating depressive symptoms (p < 0.001, face-to-face CBT: SMCR = 1.97, 95%-CI: 1.74-2.13, digital CBT: SMCR = 1.20, 95%-CI: 1.08-1.32) and adherence (p = 0.014, face-to-face CBT: 82.4%, digital CBT: 72.9%). However, after accounting for differences between face-to-face and digital CBT studies, both approaches indicate similar effectiveness. Important variables with significant moderation effects include duration of the intervention, baseline severity, adherence and the level of human guidance in digital CBT interventions. After accounting for potential confounders our analysis indicates comparable effectiveness of face-to-face and digital CBT approaches. These findings underline the importance of moderators of clinical effects and provide a basis for the future personalization of CBT treatment in depression."

As a result, a range of behaviors and other factors associated with the onset and course of depressive disorders should be examined more comprehensively. Behavioral activation (BA) is a treatment approach to these disorders that can be tailored to address certain health behaviors within the context of depression in an attempt to promote health behaviors whose adoption and maintenance can prove complementary in the treatment of depression. We conducted a scoping review of published studies in which BA-based interventions were used to promote certain health behaviors in individuals with depression. Our search of Medline and the Web of Science identified 336 potential candidate studies. Following screening and with the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria to isolate potentially eligible full-text records, we ultimately identified and evaluated 20 papers that report the nature and efficacy of these modified interventions. Across various domains, including substance use, exercise, medication adherence, and occupational and social success, we found evidence that many-but not all-of the studies we reviewed demonstrated that BA-based interventions were efficacious in promoting the health behavior of interest as well as reducing depressive symptomatology in participants. Implications for more widespread dissemination of such interventions, especially via mobile and web-based platforms due to their accessibility and affordability, are discussed. More research on the feasibility and efficacy of BA-based interventions tailored toward various determinants of health behavior and comorbidities of depressive disorders is warranted."

Nevertheless, numerous barriers, including time constraints, societal stigmatization, and feelings of shame, contribute to the limited utilization of healthcare services during the postpartum period. Digital interventions offer an opportunity to enhance care for women experiencing postpartum depressive symptoms. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a smartphone-based intervention in comparison to a treatment-as-usual control group in Germany. Our aim is to randomize 556 participants in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention group will be provided access to a preventive smartphone-based intervention called ""Smart-e-Moms,"" which incorporates therapeutic support and comprises 10 concise modules rooted in cognitive-behavioral therapy. For the intervention group, evaluations will take place at baseline (t0), prior to sessions 4 and 8 (intermediate assessments), and upon completing the intervention 6 weeks after baseline (t1). The control group's assessments will be at baseline (t0) and 6 weeks after baseline. Follow-up assessments are scheduled at 12 and 24 weeks from baseline to examine the short-term stability of any observed effects. We anticipate that participants in the intervention group will exhibit improvements in their postpartum depressive symptoms (as measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). Additionally, we will analyze secondary outcomes, including maternal bonding, stress levels, self-efficacy, satisfaction with the intervention, and healthcare utilization. DISCUSSION: If Smart-e-Moms proves to be effective, it has the potential to play a significant role in postpartum depression care within German-speaking regions. Ideally, this intervention could not only benefit maternal well-being but also improve the prospects for healthy child development. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German clinical trials registry DRKS00032324.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL through December 6, 2021, for controlled trials conducted in settings highly applicable to the United States. Additionally, we searched relevant systematic reviews for eligible studies. Results were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: We included 12 trials (n = 1,575) that examined the effects of nine dCBT programs. Overall, dCBT was slightly superior to comparators in improving depression symptoms immediately post-intervention, but not at a longer follow-up. The use of dCBT did not appear to result in an increased risk for suicidal attempts or ideation; however, the number of events was very small. Potential barriers to implementing/maintaining dCBT are challenges engaging/retaining patients, developing infrastructure, and training therapists to facilitate dCBT. Data on harms or unintended negative consequences were not reported in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: A limited body of evidence suggests that dCBT programs might outperform control interventions for reducing depressive symptoms immediately post-intervention, but not at a longer follow-up. The safety of dCBT programs for adolescents with depression is understudied."

Integrating mental health apps into more traditional therapeutic models appears to support better clinical outcomes, but also raises questions about the relationship between app engagement, the app itself, and the coach or clinician. This study explores patient app engagement patterns and the associated clinical outcomes gathered from piloting a digital clinic. Patients with anxiety or depression completed eight clinical visits and coach visits over a median of 83 days with a standard deviation of 17.25 days. Between clinical visits, patients completed therapeutic activities on the mindLAMP app. Mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores decreased from the intake visit to both visit 4 and visit 8. Patients had high app engagement, but engagement did not correlate with outcomes. From intake visit to visit 4, the interaction effects indicate significant differences in the change of both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 depending on participants' average app satisfaction and clinician/coach satisfaction (as measured by WAI-SR) with engagement. Overall, results support the feasibility of incorporating an app into a hybrid clinic."

Digital technologies provide a potential solution, although this has not been adequately tested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new smartphone app designed to reduce depression symptoms and subsequent incident depression amongst a large group of Australian workers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with follow-up assessments at 5 weeks and 3 and 12 months post-baseline. Participants were employed Australians reporting no clinically significant depression. The intervention group (N = 1128) was allocated to use HeadGear, a smartphone app which included a 30-day behavioural activation and mindfulness intervention. The attention-control group (N = 1143) used an app which included a 30-day mood monitoring component. The primary outcome was the level of depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9) at 3-month follow-up. Analyses were conducted within an intention-to-treat framework using mixed modelling. RESULTS: Those assigned to the HeadGear arm had fewer depressive symptoms over the course of the trial compared to those assigned to the control (F3,734.7 = 2.98, p = 0.031). Prevalence of depression over the 12-month period was 8.0% and 3.5% for controls and HeadGear recipients, respectively, with odds of depression caseness amongst the intervention group of 0.43 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.26-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that a smartphone app can reduce depression symptoms and potentially prevent incident depression caseness and such interventions may have a role in improving working population mental health.

10.2196/51110,Exploring the Role of Mobile Apps for Insomnia in Depression: Systematic Review,"Chiu YH, Lee YF, Lin HL, Cheng LC.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.10.18,,,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected mental health, leading to an increased prevalence of depression and insomnia. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have thoroughly transformed health care-related mobile apps, offered more effective mental health support, and alleviated the psychological stress that may have emerged during the pandemic. Early reviews outlined the use of mobile apps for dealing with depression and insomnia separately. However, there is now an urgent need for a systematic evaluation of mobile apps that address both depression and insomnia to reveal new applications and research gaps. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review and evaluate mobile apps targeting depression and insomnia, highlighting their features, effectiveness, and gaps in the current research. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2017 and 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies that (1) focused on mobile apps addressing both depression and insomnia, (2) involved young people or adult participants, and (3) provided data on treatment efficacy. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Title and abstract screening, as well as full-text screening, were completed in duplicate. Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer, and risk of bias assessments were completed accordingly. RESULTS: Of the initial 383 studies we found, 365 were excluded after title, abstract screening, and removal of duplicates. Eventually, 18 full-text articles met our criteria and underwent full-text screening. The analysis revealed that mobile apps related to depression and insomnia were primarily utilized for early detection, assessment, and screening (n=5 studies); counseling and psychological support (n=3 studies); and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; n=10 studies). Among the 10 studies related to depression, our findings showed that chatbots demonstrated significant advantages in improving depression symptoms, a promising development in the field. Additionally, 2 studies evaluated the effectiveness of mobile apps as alternative interventions for depression and sleep, further expanding the potential applications of this technology. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of AI and deep learning into mobile apps, particularly chatbots, is a promising avenue for personalized mental health support. Through innovative features, such as early detection, assessment, counseling, and CBT, these apps significantly contribute toward improving sleep quality and addressing depression. The reviewed chatbots leveraged advanced technologies, including natural language processing, machine learning, and generative dialog, to provide intelligent and autonomous interactions. Compared with traditional face-to-face therapies, their feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy highlight their user-friendly, cost-effective, and accessible nature with the aim of enhancing sleep and mental health outcomes."

Existing depression-specific cessation interventions have limited reach and are unlikely to improve smoking prevalence rates among this large subgroup of smokers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether a mobile app-based intervention tailored for depression paired with a mailed sample of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is efficacious for treating depression and promoting smoking cessation. METHODS: A 2-arm nationwide remote randomized clinical trial was conducted in the United States. Adults (N=150) with elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8≥10) who smoked were enrolled. The mobile app (""Goal2Quit"") provided behavioral strategies for treating depression and quitting smoking based on Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression. Goal2Quit participants also received a 2-week sample of combination NRT. Treatment as usual participants received a self-help booklet for quitting smoking that was not tailored for depression. Primary end points included Goal2Quit usability, change in depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II) across 12 weeks, and smoking cessation including reduction in cigarettes per day, incidence of 24-hour quit attempts, floating abstinence, and 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA). RESULTS: In total, 150 participants were enrolled between June 25, 2020, and February 23, 2022, of which 80 were female (53.3%) and the mean age was 38.4 (SD 10.3) years. At baseline, participants on average reported moderate depressive symptoms and smoked a mean of 14.7 (SD 7.5) cigarettes per day. Goal2Quit usability was strong with a mean usability rating on the System Usability Scale of 78.5 (SD 16.9), with 70% scoring above the ≥68 cutoff for above-average usability. Retention data for app use were generally strong immediately following trial enrollment and declined in subsequent weeks. Those who received Goal2Quit and the NRT sample reported lower mean depressive symptoms over the trial duration as compared to treatment as usual (difference of mean 3.72, SE 1.37 points less; P=.01). Across time points, all cessation outcomes favored Goal2Quit. Regarding abstinence, Goal2Quit participants reported significantly higher rates of 7-day PPA at weeks 4 (11% vs 0%; P=.02), 8 (7-day PPA: 12% vs 0%; P=.02), and 12 (16% vs 2%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: A mobile app intervention tailored for depression paired with a sample of NRT was effective for depression treatment and smoking cessation. Findings support the utility of this intervention approach for addressing the currently unmet public health treatment need for tailored, scalable depression-specific cessation treatments.

10.1002/cl2.1398,Mobile apps to reduce depressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth: A systematic review and meta-analysis: A systematic review,"Magwood O, Saad A, Ranger D, Volpini K, Rukikamirera F, Haridas R, Sayfi S, Alexander J, Tan Y, Pottie K.",Campbell Syst Rev,2024,2024.4.29,,,"Update of Campbell Syst Rev. 2022 Mar 14;18(1):e1222. doi: 10.1002/cl2.1222. BACKGROUND: Among youth, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol use are associated with considerable illness and disability. Youth face many personal and health system barriers in accessing mental health care. Mobile applications (apps) offer youth potentially accessible, scalable, and anonymous therapy and other support. Recent systematic reviews on apps to reduce mental health symptoms among youth have reported uncertain effectiveness, but analyses based on the type of app-delivered therapy are limited. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this systematic review with youth co-researchers to ensure that this review addressed the questions that were most important to them. The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of mobile apps for the reduction of depressive symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, psychological distress) and alcohol use among youth. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted electronic searches of the following bibliographic databases for studies published between January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2022: MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCOHost), and CENTRAL (via the Cochrane Library). The search used a combination of indexed terms, free text words, and MeSH headings. We manually screened the references of relevant systematic reviews and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors for full reports of identified trial registries or protocols. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs conducted among youth aged 15-24 years from any setting. We did not exclude populations on the basis of gender, socioeconomic status, geographic location or other personal characteristics. We included studies which assessed the effectiveness of app-delivered mental health support or therapy interventions that targeted the management of depressive disorders and/or alcohol use disorders. We excluded apps that targeted general wellness, apps which focused on prevention of psychological disorders and apps that targeted bipolar disorder, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders (aside from alcohol), and sleep disorders. Eligible comparisons included usual care, no intervention, wait-list control, alternative or controlled mobile applications. We included studies which reported outcomes on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, alcohol use and psychological distress over any follow-up period. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We standardized the PICO definitions (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) of each included study and grouped studies by the type of therapy or support offered by the app. Whenever app design and clinical homogeneity allowed, we meta-analyzed outcomes using a random-effects model. Outcome data measured using categorical scales were synthesized using odds ratios. Outcome data measured using continuous scales were synthesized as the standardized mean difference. We assessed the methodological quality of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and we assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: From 5280 unique citations, we included 36 RCTs published in 37 reports and conducted in 15 different countries (7984 participants). Among the 36 included trials, we assessed two with an overall low risk of bias, 8 trials with some concern regarding risk of bias, and 26 trials with a high risk of bias. Interventions varied in the type of therapy or supports offered. The most common intervention designs employed mindfulness training, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or a combination of the two (mindfulness + CBT). However, other interventions also included self-monitoring, medication reminders, cognitive bias modification or positive stimulation, dialectical behavioral therapy, gamified health promotion, or social skill building. Mindfulness apps led to short term improvements in depressive symptoms when compared to a withheld control (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI [-0.63, -0.10]; p = 0.007, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very low certainty) and when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI [-0.53, -0.01]; p = 0.04, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Apps delivering this type of support also significantly improved symptoms of anxiety when compared to a withheld control (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI [-0.60, -0.09]; p = 0.008, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very low) but not when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.24; 95% CI [-0.50, 0.02]; p = 0.07, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Mindfulness apps showed improvements in psychological stress that approached statistical significance among participants receiving the mindfulness mobile apps compared to those in the withheld control (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI [-0.56, 0.03]; p = .07, n = 4 RCTs, GRADE: very low). CBT apps also led to short-term improvements in depressive symptoms when compared to a withheld control (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI [-0.80, 0.01]; p = 0.05, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low) and when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI [-0.98, -0.19]; p = 0.003, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). CBT-based apps also improved symptoms of anxiety compared to a withheld control (SMD = -0.51; 95% CI [-0.94, -0.09]; p = 0.02, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very low) but not when compared to an active control (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI [-1.11, 0.59]; p = 0.55, n = 3 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Apps which combined mindfulness and CBT did not significantly improve symptoms of depression (SMD = -0.20; 95% CI [-0.42, 0.02]; p = 0.07, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low) or anxiety (SMD = -0.21; 95% CI [-0.49, 0.07]; p = 0.14, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). However, these apps did improve psychological distress (SMD = -0.43; 95% CI [-0.74, -0.12]; p = 0.006, n = 2 RCTs, GRADE: very low). The results of trials on apps to reduce alcohol use were inconsistent. We did not identify any harms associated with the use of apps to manage mental health concerns. All effectiveness results had a very low certainty of evidence rating using the GRADE approach, meaning that apps which deliver therapy or other mental health support may reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress but the evidence is very uncertain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed evidence from 36 trials conducted among youth. According to our meta-analyses, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of apps on depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and alcohol use. Very few effects were interpreted to be of clinical importance. Most of the RCTs were small studies focusing on efficacy for youth at risk for depressive symptoms. Larger trials are needed to evaluate effectiveness and allow for further analysis of subgroup differences. Longer trials are also needed to better estimate the clinical importance of these apps over the long term."

Therefore, we conducted the first systematic review on mediators in IMIs for depression, investigating mechanisms of change in interventions with different theoretical backgrounds and delivery modes (PROSPERO CRD42019130301). Two independent reviewers screened references from five databases (i.e., Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO and ICTRP), selected studies for inclusion and extracted data from eligible studies. We included 26 RCTs on mediators in IMIs for depression (6820 participants), rated their risk of bias and adherence to methodological quality criteria for psychotherapy process research. Primary studies examined 64 mediators, with cognitive variables (e.g., perceived control, rumination or interpretation bias) being the largest group of both examined (m = 28) and significant mediators (m = 22); followed by a range of other mediators, including mindfulness, acceptance and behavioral activation. Our findings might contribute to the empirically-informed advancement of interventions and mental health care practices, enabling optimized treatment outcomes for patients with depression. Furthermore, we discuss implications for future research and provide methodological recommendations for forthcoming mediation studies with more pertinent designs, allowing for inferences with higher causal specificity."
10.7759/cureus.82793,When Software Becomes Medicine: Ignoring It May Soon Be Malpractice,Lakhan SE.,Cureus,2025,2025.4.24,,,"The convergence of mobile software, artificial intelligence, and biomedical science is ushering in a new era of precision medicine, defined not only by personalization but by real-time adaptability. This shift is exemplified by the evolution of Prescription Digital Therapeutics (PDTs): smartphone-based applications that treat a disease or condition and are regulated in the US by the FDA. Early PDTs (PDT 1.0) such as reSET for substance use disorder, reSET-O for opioid use disorder, and Somryst for chronic insomnia digitized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) into a smartphone app and laid the foundation for regulated digital interventions. Now in the era of PDT 2.0, we see greater personalization, multimodal approaches beyond CBT, robust clinical validation, and targeting drug-like endpoints with Rejoyn for major depressive disorder, CT-132 for episodic migraine prevention, Luminopia for amblyopia, and CT-155 in development for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite promising results, widespread adoption remains limited by reimbursement, clinician and patient awareness, and integration into clinical workflows. On the horizon is smart medicine: a convergence of traditional pharmacotherapy with PDTs that work together to enhance overall effectiveness, safety and tolerability, and engagement, adherence, and personalization. These medicines optimize outcomes in ways conventional therapies cannot and, in true closed-loop principles, assess for disease and symptoms and modulate both the digital and drug interventions. Drawing from my work experience on multiple PDTs, this paper highlights how PDTs are transforming care. The FDA's Prescription Drug Use-Related Software (PDURS) guidance affirms the regulatory foundation for integrating PDTs and drugs. Meaningful therapeutic advancements now depend not only on the molecular design but also on the mechanisms, digital or otherwise, that support its success. I postulate that within the next five years, omitting digital interventions when indicated will not just be outdated, it may be malpractice."
10.3390/healthcare11020272,Analysis of Mobile App-Based Mental Health Solutions for College Students: A Rapid Review,"Choudhury A, Kuehn A, Shamszare H, Shahsavar Y.",Healthcare (Basel),2023,2023.1.21,,,"BACKGROUND: College students are one of the most susceptible age groups to mental health problems. With the growing popularity of mobile health (mHealth), there is an increasing need to investigate its implications for mental health solutions. This review evaluates mHealth interventions for addressing mental health problems among college students. METHODS: An online database search was conducted. Articles were required to focus on the impact of mHealth intervention on student mental health. Fifteen of the 487 articles, initially pulled from the search query, were included in the review. RESULTS: The review identified three primary aspects of mental health: depression, anxiety, and stress. Research that found statistically significant improvements following mHealth intervention involved study durations between four and eight weeks, daily app use, guided lessons using cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and meditation. The review's findings show that future work must address the concern of digital divide, gender and sex differences, and have larger sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: There is potential to improve depressive symptoms and other similar mental health problems among college students via mobile app interventions. However, actions must be taken to improve barriers to communication and better reach the younger generations."

This review aims to identify self-help apps available exclusively for people with depression and evaluate those that offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or behavioural activation (BA). One hundred and seventeen apps have been identified after searching both the scientific literature and the commercial market. 10.26% (n = 12) of these apps identified through our search offer support that seems to be consistent with evidence-based principles of CBT or BA. Taking into account the non existence of effectiveness/efficacy studies, and the low level of adherence to the core ingredients of the CBT/BA models, the utility of these CBT/BA apps are questionable. The usability of reviewed apps is highly variable and they rarely are accompanied by explicit privacy or safety policies. Despite the growing public demand, there is a concerning lack of appropiate CBT or BA apps, especially from a clinical and legal point of view. The application of superior scientific, technological, and legal knowledge is needed to improve the development, testing, and accessibility of apps for people with depression."

The present study aimed to assess the effects of mental health apps on managing the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for the papers published from 2000 to 2019. Studies were included if they reviewed articles or mobile apps for their effectiveness in stress, anxiety, and depression. The reviews that had considered mobile apps or web-based mobile applications as an intervention or part of intervention were included, as well. RESULTS: A total of 4,999 peer-reviewed articles were identified, out of which nine systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Seven systematic reviews measured depression outcomes, three measured stress, and five systematic reviews measured anxiety symptoms. The applications that used behavior change strategies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Behavioral Activation, reported significant effects on depression, anxiety, and stress. CONCLUSION: It seems that mental health apps can be promising media for reducing depressive symptoms. This field is an emerging area of mobile health, and further research should be done in future in order to reach conclusive evidence."

Over the past few years, digital health interventions have been developed and considered promising in increasing psychological wellbeing among university students. Therefore, this umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence on digital health interventions targeting university students and to evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 2021 searching PubMed, Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection, Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting university students. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO [CRD42021234773]. RESULTS: The initital literature search resulted in 806 records of which seven remained after duplicates were removed and evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Effectiveness was reported and categorized into the following six delivery types: (a) web-based, online/computer-delivered interventions (b) computer-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), (c) mobile applications and short message service (d) virtual reality interventions (e) skills training (f) relaxation and exposure-based therapy. Results indicated web-based online/computer delivered-interventions were effective or at least partially effective at decressing depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorder symptoms. This was similar for skills-training interventions, CBT-based intervention and mobile applications. However, digital mental health interventions using virtual reality and relaxation, exposure-based therapy was inconclusive. Due to the variation in study settings and inconsistencies in reporting, effectiveness was greatly dependent on the delivery format, targeted mental health problem and targeted purpose group. CONCLUSION: The findings provide evidence for the beneficial effect of digital mental health interventions for university students. However, this review calls for a more systematic approach in testing and reporting the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions."
10.2196/28244,Behavioral Activation and Depression Symptomatology: Longitudinal Assessment of Linguistic Indicators in Text-Based Therapy Sessions,"Burkhardt HA, Alexopoulos GS, Pullmann MD, Hull TD, Areán PA, Cohen T.",J Med Internet Res,2021,2021.7.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) is rooted in the behavioral theory of depression, which states that increased exposure to meaningful, rewarding activities is a critical factor in the treatment of depression. Assessing constructs relevant to BA currently requires the administration of standardized instruments, such as the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS), which places a burden on patients and providers, among other potential limitations. Previous work has shown that depressed and nondepressed individuals may use language differently and that automated tools can detect these differences. The increasing use of online, chat-based mental health counseling presents an unparalleled resource for automated longitudinal linguistic analysis of patients with depression, with the potential to illuminate the role of reward exposure in recovery. OBJECTIVE: This work investigated how linguistic indicators of planning and participation in enjoyable activities identified in online, text-based counseling sessions relate to depression symptomatology over time. METHODS: Using distributional semantics methods applied to a large corpus of text-based online therapy sessions, we devised a set of novel BA-related categories for the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software package. We then analyzed the language used by 10,000 patients in online therapy chat logs for indicators of activation and other depression-related markers using LIWC. RESULTS: Despite their conceptual and operational differences, both previously established LIWC markers of depression and our novel linguistic indicators of activation were strongly associated with depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9) and longitudinal patient trajectories. Emotional tone; pronoun rates; words related to sadness, health, and biology; and BA-related LIWC categories appear to be complementary, explaining more of the variance in the PHQ score together than they do independently. CONCLUSIONS: This study enables further work in automated diagnosis and assessment of depression, the refinement of BA psychotherapeutic strategies, and the development of predictive models for decision support."

Digitally based interventions may serve to bridge this access gap for adolescents in need of care. Digital interventions that deliver components of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression, and virtual reality (VR) may be a promising adjunctive component. However, research on these types of treatments in adolescents and young adults is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Spark (v1.0), a 5-week, self-guided, CBT-based digital program using a mobile app and VR experiences to target symptoms of depression in adolescents. METHODS: A single-arm, open-label study of the Spark program was conducted with a community sample of 30 adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years with self-reported moderate to severe depression symptoms. Participants completed a weekly depression assessment (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) in the app during the 5-week intervention period as well as web-based baseline, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up self-report assessments. The participants also completed a qualitative postintervention interview. For participants aged <18 years, caregivers completed assessments at baseline and postintervention time points. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rate (the proportion of participants who enrolled in the study divided by the total number of participants screened for eligibility) and retention rate (the proportion of participants who completed postintervention assessments divided by the total number of participants who received the intervention). Acceptability outcomes included engagement with the program and quantitative and qualitative feedback about the program. Preliminary efficacy was evaluated based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8. RESULTS: The study recruitment (31/66, 47%) and retention (29/30, 97%) rates were high. Participants provided higher ratings for the ease of use of the Spark program (8.76 out of 10) and their enjoyment of both the mobile app (7.00 out of 10) and VR components (7.48 out of 10) of the program, whereas they provided lower ratings for the program's ability to improve mood (4.38 out of 10) or fit into their daily routines (5.69 out of 10). We observed a clinically and statistically significant reduction in depression scores at postintervention (mean difference 5.36; P<.001) and 1-month follow-up (mean difference 6.44; P<.001) time points. CONCLUSIONS: The Spark program was found to be a feasible and acceptable way to deliver a self-guided CBT-focused intervention to adolescents and young adults with symptoms of depression. Preliminary data also indicated that the Spark program reduced the symptoms of depression in adolescents and young adults. Future studies should evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial.

The specific objectives were to examine the available interactive self-care apps in terms of guidance provided to users to make decisions regarding use of app, inclusion of elements that encourage professional help-seeking, guidance regarding managing psychological crisis and the range of therapeutic strategies incorporated. Using the search term 'depression', 278 apps were identified in the first step and these spanned a wide range of categories. Information on coping with depression and stand alone screening tools formed the two largest types of free apps. Features of interactive self-care apps (N = 33) were reviewed further and this exercise showed that less than 10% of the apps incorporated explicit delineation of their scope or initial screening for suitability. Guidance regarding managing suicidal crisis were incorporated in only about 12% of the interactive apps. Slightly more than one third of these apps included content aimed at encouraging professional help seeking when needed or an explicit mention of their theoretical or empirical basis. Monitoring moods, thoughts and behaviors were the commonest therapeutic strategies incorporated in these apps, in addition, to a wide range of other strategies such as behavioral activation, identifying and correcting cognitive errors, mindfulness exercises, cultivation of gratitude, and medication management. The challenges for a potential user of these apps are discussed and ways to address the same are highlighted."
10.1093/ntr/ntae137,Behavioral Activation mHealth Application for Smoking Cessation: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Heffner JL, Serfozo E, Baker K, Gasser M, Watson N, Daughters SB, Becoňa E, McClure JB.",Nicotine Tob Res,2024,2024.6.7,,,"INTRODUCTION: Behavioral activation (BA) is an effective intervention for both depression and substance use disorders. Combining BA with a standard smoking cessation intervention may improve quit rates by addressing depressive symptoms, a key barrier to quitting. This study preliminarily evaluated the acceptability and efficacy of the BA-based Actify! mobile health application (mHealth app) for smoking cessation. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (n = 242) comparing Actify! with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) app for smoking cessation (QuitGuide) on acceptability (user satisfaction, app openings), smoking abstinence, and mechanisms of change (BA and depressive symptoms) at 8 weeks and 6 months postrandomization. Participants were US adults recruited online who smoked daily. RESULTS: Treatment satisfaction was uniformly higher in the Actify! arm. Number of app openings was similar across arms (M = 34.3 openings over 8 weeks in both arms). Self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 8 weeks was 12.6% for Actify! versus 7.3% for QuitGuide. Differences in 30-day PPA continued through 6 months (18.5% for Actify! vs. 12.2% for QuitGuide). Changes between baseline and 8 weeks in depressive symptoms and BA favored Actify!. Planned subgroup analyses suggested greater benefit of Actify! among participants with pretreatment mild-to-moderate depression symptom severity compared to those with no depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Actify! showed considerable promise as a novel mHealth treatment, as evidenced by its high usage and higher user satisfaction and quit rates than QuitGuide at both short- and long-term follow-up. The next step is to evaluate Actify! in a fully powered efficacy trial. IMPLICATIONS: Study findings demonstrate the promise of a BA-based mobile health app (Actify!) for smoking cessation as a population-level intervention that can effectively address depressive symptoms as a risk factor for worse smoking treatment outcomes. The Actify! app is the first standalone BA-based app to demonstrate potential for improved acceptability and efficacy relative to a standard care comparison app, with user satisfaction and smoking quit rates descriptively exceeding those of the NCI's QuitGuide app."

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of app-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in preventing future onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) in youth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a randomized, assessor-blind, parallel group-controlled trial in Chinese youth (aged 15-25 years) with insomnia disorder and subclinical depressive symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 6-week app-based CBT-I or 6-week app-based health education (HE) delivered through smartphones. Online assessments and telephone clinical interviews were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD. The secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms and insomnia at both symptom and disorder levels. Between September 9, 2019, and November 25, 2022, 708 participants (407 females [57%]; mean age, 22.1 years [SD = 1.9]) were randomly allocated to app-based CBT-I group (n = 354) or app-based HE group (n = 354). Thirty-seven participants (10%) in the intervention group and 62 participants (18%) in the control group developed new-onset MDD throughout the 12-month follow-up, with a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.87; p = 0.008). The number needed to treat to prevent MDD at 1 year was 10.9 (6.8-26.6). The app-based CBT-I group has higher remission rates of insomnia disorder than the controls at post-intervention (52% versus 28%; relative risk 1.83 [1.49-2.24]; p < 0.001) and throughout 12-month follow-up. In addition, the CBT-I group reported a greater decrease in depressive (adjusted difference -1.0 [-1.6 to -0.5]; Cohen's d = 0.53; p < 0.001) and insomnia symptoms (-2.0 [-2.7 to -1.3], d = 0.78; p < 0.001) than the controls at post-intervention and throughout 6-month follow-up. Insomnia was a mediator of intervention effects on depression. No adverse events related to the interventions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: App-based CBT-I is effective in preventing future onset of major depression and improving insomnia outcomes among youth with insomnia and subclinical depression. These findings highlight the importance of targeting insomnia to prevent the onset of MDD and emphasize the need for wider dissemination of digital CBT-I to promote sleep and mental health in the youth population.

There are evidence-based treatments, but it is difficult to reach all people in need. Internet-based interventions, and more recently smartphone-based interventions, were explored to overcome barriers to access. Evidence shows them to be effective alternatives to traditional treatments. This paper presents the protocol of a pilot study whose primary aim is to investigate the efficacy of a smartphone-based serious game intervention for patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. METHODS: This randomized controlled pilot trial protocol foresees two arms design: 1/ smartphone- based serious game intervention (based on Cognitive Behavior Therapy with particular emphasis on Behavioral Activation and Physical Activity), 2/ waiting list control group. The study is expected to recruit 40 participants (18+), which will be randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions. The duration of the intervention is two months. The primary outcome measure will be depressive symptomatology. Secondary outcomes will include other variables such as physical activity, resilience, anxiety, depression impairment, and positive and negative affect. Treatment expectation, satisfaction, usability, and game playability will also be measured. The data will be analyzed based on the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses. DISCUSSION: The study aims to establish initial evidence for the efficacy of a smartphone-based serious game intervention, to serve as input for a larger-scale randomized control trial. The intervention exploits advanced smartphone capabilities, such as the use of a serious game as delivery mode, with the potential benefit of engagement and treatment adherence, and motion sensors to monitor and stimulate physical activity. As a secondary objective, the study aims to gather initial evidence on the user's expectations, satisfaction, usability and playability of the serious game as a treatment."

10.2196/51428,The Effectiveness of a Digital App for Reduction of Clinical Symptoms in Individuals With Panic Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Kim K, Hwang H, Bae S, Kim SM, Han DH.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.4.12,,,"BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is a common and important disease in clinical practice that decreases individual productivity and increases health care use. Treatments comprise medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, adverse medication effects and poor treatment compliance mean new therapeutic models are needed. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that digital therapy for panic disorder may improve panic disorder symptoms and that treatment response would be associated with brain activity changes assessed with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: Individuals (n=50) with a history of panic attacks were recruited. Symptoms were assessed before and after the use of an app for panic disorder, which in this study was a smartphone-based app for treating the clinical symptoms of panic disorder, panic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. The hemodynamics in the frontal cortex during the resting state were measured via fNIRS. The app had 4 parts: diary, education, quest, and serious games. The study trial was approved by the institutional review board of Chung-Ang University Hospital (1041078-202112-HR-349-01) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. RESULTS: The number of participants with improved panic symptoms in the app use group (20/25, 80%) was greater than that in the control group (6/21, 29%; χ21=12.3; P=.005). During treatment, the improvement in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the app use group was greater than that in the control group (F1,44=7.03; P=.01). In the app use group, the total PDSS score declined by 42.5% (mean score 14.3, SD 6.5 at baseline and mean score 7.2, SD 3.6 after the intervention), whereas the PDSS score declined by 14.6% in the control group (mean score 12.4, SD 5.2 at baseline and mean score 9.8, SD 7.9 after the intervention). There were no significant differences in accumulated oxygenated hemoglobin (accHbO2) at baseline between the app use and control groups. During treatment, the reduction in accHbO2 in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; F1,44=8.22; P=.006) and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; F1,44=8.88; P=.005) was greater in the app use than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Apps for panic disorder should effectively reduce symptoms and VLPFC and OFC brain activity in patients with panic disorder. The improvement of panic disorder symptoms was positively correlated with decreased VLPFC and OFC brain activity in the resting state.

According to the fast-growing field of information and communication technologies and its dissemination, there is a need for mapping the technological landscape and its benefits for users. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to give an overview of the digital health interventions used for depression. The main goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive review of the system landscape and its technological state and functions, as well as its evidence and benefits for users. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of digital health interventions for the treatment of depression. PubMed, PSYNDEX, and the Cochrane Library were searched by two independent researchers in October 2020 to identify relevant publications of the last 10 years, which were examined using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To conduct the review, we used Rayyan, a freely available web tool. RESULTS: In total, 65 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. After categorizing the studies into the areas of prevention, early detection, therapy, and relapse prevention, we found dominant numbers of studies in the area of therapy (n=52). There was only one study for prevention, 5 studies for early detection, and 7 studies for relapse prevention. The most dominant therapy approaches were cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and problem-solving therapy. Most of the studies revealed significant effects of digital health interventions when cognitive behavioral therapy was applied. Cognitive behavioral therapy as the most dominant form was often provided through web-based systems. Combined interventions consisting of web-based and smartphone-based approaches are increasingly found. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions for treating depression are quite comprehensive. There are different interventions focusing on different fields of care. While most interventions can be beneficial to achieve a better depression treatment, it can be difficult to determine which approaches are suitable. Cognitive behavioral therapy through digital health interventions has shown good effects in the treatment of depression, but treatment for depression still stays very individualistic."
10.2196/24703,Effectiveness of Smartphone-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Among Patients With Major Depression: Systematic Review of Health Implications,"Hrynyschyn R, Dockweiler C.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021.2.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression is often associated with rapid changes in mood and quality of life that persist for a period of 2 weeks. Despite medical innovations, there are problems in the provision of care. Long waiting times for treatment and high recurrence rates of depression cause enormous costs for health care systems. At the same time, comprehensive limitations in physical, psychological, and social dimensions are observed for patients with depression, which significantly reduce their quality of life. In addition to patient-specific limitations, undersupply and inappropriate health care have been determined. For this reason, new forms of care are discussed. Smartphone-based therapy is considered to have great potential due to its reach and easy accessibility. Low socioeconomic groups, which are always difficult to reach for public health interventions, can now be accessed due to the high dispersion of smartphones. There is still little information about the impact and mechanisms of smartphone-based therapy on depression. In a systematic literature review, the health implications of smartphone-based therapy were presented in comparison with standard care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify and summarize the existing evidence regarding smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy for patients with depression and to present the health implications of smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy of considered endpoints. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant studies by means of inclusion and exclusion criteria. For this purpose, the PubMed and Psyndex databases were systematically searched using a search syntax. The endpoints of depressive symptoms, depression-related anxiety, self-efficacy or self-esteem, and quality of life were analyzed. Identified studies were evaluated for study quality and risk of bias. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 8 studies were identified. RESULTS: The studies examined in this review reported contradictory results regarding the investigated endpoints. In addition, due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, it was difficult to derive evident results. All included studies reported effects on depressive symptoms. The other investigated endpoints were only reported by isolated studies. Only 50% (4/8) of the studies reported effects on depression-related anxiety, self-efficacy or self-esteem, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: No clear implications of smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy could be established. Evidence for the treatment of depression using smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy is limited. Additional research projects are needed to demonstrate the effects of smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy in the context of evidence-based medicine and to enable its translation into standard care. Participatory technology development might help to address current problems in mobile health intervention studies."

Digital therapeutic solutions using cognitive behavioral therapy have demonstrated efficacy in depression and anxiety. A common goal of digital health apps is to increase user digital engagement to improve outcomes. However, there is a limited understanding of the association between digital platform components and clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to investigate the contribution of specific digital engagement tools to mental health conditions. We hypothesized that participation in coaching sessions and breathing exercises would be associated with a reduction in depression and anxiety. METHODS: Depression and general anxiety symptoms were evaluated in real-world data cohorts using the digital health platform for digital intervention and monitoring change. This retrospective real-world analysis of users on a mobile platform-based treatment followed two cohorts of people: (1) users who started with moderate levels of depression and completed at least 2 depression assessments (n=519) and (2) users who started with moderate levels of anxiety and completed at least 2 anxiety assessments (n=474). Levels of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were tracked throughout the first 16 weeks. A piecewise mixed-effects model was applied to model the trajectories of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 mean scores in 2 segments (1-6 weeks and 7-16 weeks). Finally, simple slope analysis was used for the interpretation of the interactions probing the moderators: coaching sessions and breathing exercises in both depression and anxiety cohorts. RESULTS: Analysis revealed a significant decrease in depression symptoms (β=-.37, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.28; P≤.001) during the period of weeks 1-6 of app use, which was maintained during the period of 7-16 weeks. Coach interaction significantly moderated the reduction in depression symptoms during the period of weeks 1-6 (β=-.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.001; P=.02). A significant decrease in anxiety symptoms (β=-.41, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.33; P≤.001) was revealed during the period of 1-6 weeks, which was maintained during the period of 7-16 weeks. Breathing exercises significantly moderated the reduction in anxiety symptoms during the period of 1-6 weeks (β=-.07, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated general improvement followed by a period of stability of depression and anxiety symptoms associated with cognitive behavioral therapy-based digital intervention. Interestingly, engagement with a coaching session but not a breathing exercise was associated with a reduction in depression symptoms. Moreover, breathing exercise but not engagement with a coaching session was associated with a reduction of anxiety symptoms. These findings emphasize the importance of using a personalized approach to behavioral health during digital health interventions."
10.1080/13607863.2022.2056878,A pilot study for a smartphone app for the prevention of depression in non-professional caregivers,"Blanco V, Otero P, Vázquez FL.",Aging Ment Health,2023,2022.3.30,,,"OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a cognitive-behavioral prevention intervention administered through a smartphone app in non-professional caregivers with symptoms of depression. The secondary objective was to make a preliminary evaluation of its effectiveness either alone or supplemented with telephone conference calls. METHODS: Eighty-seven participants (Mage = 51.8 years) were randomly assigned to an app-based cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBIA; n = 29), CBIA supplemented with telephone conference calls (CBIA + CC; n = 28), or an attention control group (ACG; n = 30). The participants for both interventions received five cognitive-behavioral modules through the app, and those in CBIA + CC an additional 30-minute phone call in each module. RESULTS: 3.4% of caregivers dropped out. In all groups, the number of modules completed was high. Participants completed a high percentage of the homework and were highly satisfied with both CBIA and CBIA + CC. At post-intervention, there was a lower incidence of depression and depressive symptoms for CBIA + CC compared with CBIA, and for CBIA and CBIA + CC compared with ACG. CONCLUSION: The results supported the feasibility and acceptability of the cognitive-behavioral intervention, and demonstrated that telephone contact improves its effectiveness."
10.3390/ijerph17186753,A Pilot Evaluation of a Smartphone Application for Workplace Depression,"Collins DAJ, Harvey SB, Lavender I, Glozier N, Christensen H, Deady M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020,2020.9.19,,,"Interventions delivered via mobile apps show particular promise in tackling the burden of common mental disorders. Appropriately targeting these interventions to at-risk populations is critical to their success. This pilot study aimed to assess the usability, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of an app-based intervention designed to target depressive symptoms in a stressed working population. Anchored, a smartphone app including a 30-day program of mindfulness and cognitive and behavioural therapeutic components, was tested in a pre-post pilot study with participants recruited via social media advertisements. Eligible participants (N = 81) were Australian adults who were employed and reported elevated stress levels on a single-item screening measure. Follow-up assessment occurred 5 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome measure was change in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes measuring change in anxiety, wellbeing, stress, resilience, exercise, alcohol use, absenteeism, and work performance. User feedback and in-app data were analysed to assess engagement and intervention adherence. At follow-up, there were significant reductions in depressive symptoms (t61 = 6.35; p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (t60 = 7.35; p < 0.001), along with significantly reduced cases of likely new onset depression compared to baseline (24% vs. 6%, p = 0.012). Significant improvements were also seen in wellbeing (t60 = -5.64; p < 0.001), resilience (t60 = -3.89; p < 0.001), stress (t61 = 11.18; p < 0.001), and alcohol use (t60 = 3.40; p = 0.001). Participants reported no significant changes in work performance, absenteeism or exercise. There were satisfactory levels of app usability, feasibility, and acceptability. Most participants found the app easy to use (93.2%), understood the app content well (83.0%), and rated the app highly or very highly overall (72.9%). User feedback suggestions were predominantly focused on improving app navigation and user interface. This pilot study provides encouraging evidence that Anchored has potentially beneficial effects, and is usable, feasible, and acceptable as an app-based intervention for the working population experiencing elevated stress. Further testing of Anchored in a randomised controlled trial is required to investigate its efficacy as an intervention for workplace mental ill-health."

Although mental health apps can provide scalable prevention, few have been rigorously tested in high-powered trials built on models of healthy emotional functioning or tailored to individual profiles. We aimed to test a personalised emotional competence app versus a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help app versus a self-monitoring app to prevent an increase in depression symptoms in young people. METHODS: This multicentre, parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trial, within a cohort multiple randomised trial (including a parallel trial of wellbeing promotion) was done at four university trial sites in the UK, Germany, Spain, and Belgium. Participants were recruited from schools, universities, and social media from the four respective countries. Eligible participants were aged 16-22 years with increased vulnerability indexed by baseline emotional competence profile, without current or past diagnosis of major depression. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to usual practice plus either the personalised emotional competence self-help app, the generic CBT self-help app, or the self-monitoring app by an independent computerised system, minimised by country, age, and self-reported gender, and followed up for 12 months post-randomisation. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was depression symptoms (according to Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3-month follow-up, analysed in participants who completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04148508, and is closed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2020, and Aug 3, 2021, 1262 participants were enrolled, including 417 to the emotional competence app, 423 to the CBT app, and 422 to the self-monitoring app. Mean age was 18·8 years (SD 2·0). Of 1262 participants self-reporting gender, 984 (78·0%) were female, 253 (20·0%) were male, 15 (1·2%) were neither, and ten (0·8%) were both. 178 participants in the emotional competence app group, 191 in the CBT app group, and 199 in the self-monitoring app group completed the follow-up assessment at 3 months. At 3 months, depression symptoms were lower with the CBT app than the self-monitoring app (mean difference in PHQ-9 -1·18 [95% CI -2·01 to -0·34]; p=0·006), but depression symptoms did not differ between the emotional competence app and the CBT app (0·63 [-0·22 to 1·49]; p=0·15) or the self-monitoring app and emotional competence app (-0·54 [-1·39 to 0·31]; p=0·21). 31 of the 541 participants who completed any of the follow-up assessments received treatment in hospital or were admitted to hospital for mental health-related reasons considered unrelated to interventions (eight in the emotional competence app group, 15 in the CBT app group, and eight in the self-monitoring app group). No deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: The CBT app delayed increases in depression symptoms in at-risk young people relative to the self-monitoring app, although this benefit faded by 12 months. Against hypotheses, the emotional competence app was not more effective at reducing depression symptoms than the self-monitoring app. CBT self-help apps might be valuable public mental health interventions for young people given their scalability, non-consumable nature, and affordability.

10.2196/38460,Brief App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Symptoms in Psychiatric Inpatients: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,"Sharma G, Schlosser L, Jones BDM, Blumberger DM, Gratzer D, Husain MO, Mulsant BH, Rappaport L, Stergiopoulos V, Husain MI.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.11.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric inpatients often have limited access to psychotherapeutic education or skills for managing anxiety, a common transdiagnostic concern in severe and acute mental illness. COVID-19-related restrictions further limited access to therapy groups on inpatient psychiatric units. App-based interventions may improve access, but evidence supporting the feasibility of their use, acceptability, and effectiveness in psychiatric inpatient settings is limited. MindShift CBT is a free app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles with evidence for alleviating anxiety symptoms in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to recruit 24 participants from an acute general psychiatric inpatient ward to a 1-month randomized control study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of providing patients with severe and acute mental illness access to the MindShift CBT app for help with managing anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Recruitment, data collection, analysis, and interpretation were completed collaboratively by clinician and peer researchers. Inpatients were randomized to two conditions: treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU plus use of the MindShift CBT app over 6 days. We collected demographic and quantitative data on acceptability and usability of the intervention. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were measured in pre- and poststudy surveys for preliminary signals of efficacy. We conducted individual semistructured interviews with participants in the MindShift CBT app group at the end of their trial period, which were interpreted using a standardized protocol for thematic analysis. RESULTS: Over 4 weeks, 33 inpatients were referred to the study, 24 consented to participate, 20 were randomized, and 11 completed the study. Of the 9 randomized participants who did not complete the study, 7 were withdrawn because they were discharged or transferred prior to study completion, with a similar distribution among both conditions. Among the enrolled patients, 65% (13/20) were admitted for a psychotic disorder and no patient was admitted primarily for an anxiety disorder. The average length of stay was 20 days (SD 4.4; range 3-21) and 35% (7/20) of patients were involuntarily admitted to hospital. Small sample sizes limited accurate interpretation of the efficacy data. Themes emerging from qualitative interviews included acceptability and usability of the app, and patient agency associated with voluntary participation in research while admitted to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our study benefitted from collaboration between peer and clinician researchers. Due to rapid patient turnover in the acute inpatient setting, additional flexibility in recruitment and enrollment is needed to determine the efficacy of using app-based psychotherapy on an acute psychiatric ward. Despite the limited sample size, our study suggests that similar interventions may be feasible and acceptable for acutely unwell inpatients. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of psychotherapeutic apps with existing standards of care in this setting.

10.2196/44764,Challenges With the Use of Digital Sham: Systematic Review and Recommendations,"Bos E, Preller KH, Kaur G, Malhotra P, Kharawala S, Motti D.",J Med Internet Res,2023,2023.10.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-based products that prevent, manage, or treat a medical condition and are delivered through a smartphone app, web application, or wearable device. Clinical trials assessing DTx pose challenges, foremost among which is designing appropriate digital shams (or digital placebos), which should ideally mimic DTx (in terms of design, components, and duration of treatment) while omitting the active principle or component. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our review was to understand how digital shams are being used in clinical research on DTx in neuroscience, which is the most common therapy area for DTx. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) with a focus on controlled clinical trials involving digital shams. Studies were identified from trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, and Trial Trove) and through structured searches in MEDLINE and Embase (both via the Embase website) and were limited to articles in English published from 2010 onward. These were supplemented by keyword-based searches in PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar and bibliographic searches. Studies assessing DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) were included. Details related to the publication, DTx, comparator, patient population, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Our search criteria identified 461 neuroscience studies involving 213 unique DTx. Most DTx were extended reality based (86/213, 40.4%) or mobile device based (56/213, 26.3%); 313 were comparative, of which 68 (21.7%) used shams. The most common therapeutic areas assessed in these studies were stroke (42/213, 19.7%), depression (32/213, 15%), and anxiety (24/213, 11.3%). The most common treatments were cognitive behavioral therapy or behavioral therapy (67/213, 32.4%), physical rehabilitation (60/213, 28.2%), and cognitive training (41/213, 19.2%). We identified the following important issues related to the use of digital shams in neuroscience: shams were not validated before use in studies, they varied widely in design (from being nearly identical to the DTx to using different software programs altogether), and the level of patient engagement or satisfaction with the sham and the impact of the sham on study outcomes were infrequently reported. CONCLUSIONS: Digital shams are critical for the clinical development of DTx in neuroscience. Given the importance of sham controls in evaluating DTx efficacy, we provide recommendations on the key information that should be reported in a well-designed DTx trial and propose an algorithm to allow the correct interpretation of DTx study results. Sham-controlled studies should be routinely used in DTx trials-in early-phase studies-to help identify DTx active components and-in late-phase studies-to confirm the efficacy of DTx. The use of shams early in development will ensure that the appropriate sham control is used in later confirmatory trials."

DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus from their beginnings to July 18, 2016. Keywords were ""randomized, controlled trials of computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy for depression"" and ""randomized, controlled trials of mobile apps for cognitive-behavior therapy of depression."" STUDY SELECTION: Of 223 studies identified in the search, 183 were excluded yielding a sample of 40 randomized, controlled investigations of computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy (CCBT) for depression. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted independently by two authors, and consensus was reached by discussion with a third author. RESULTS: The overall mean effect size for CCBT compared to control conditions was g = 0.502, a moderately large effect. Studies that provided support from a clinician or other person yielded significantly larger effects (g = 0.673) than studies in which no support was provided (g = 0.239). Completion rate and study setting also influenced outcomes. Lower mean effect sizes were observed in studies with lower completion rates and in studies conducted in primary care practices. CONCLUSIONS: CCBT with a modest amount of support from a clinician or other helping person was found to be efficacious with relatively large mean effect sizes on measures of depressive symptoms. Self-guided CCBT for depression was considerably less effective. Future research should focus on enhancing the implementation of CCBT, including evaluating the amount and type of support needed for effective delivery, methods to improve engagement with computer-assisted therapies, and ways to improve treatment outcome in primary care settings."

Yet, a minority receive adequate treatment due to person-level (eg, geographical distance to providers) and systems-level (eg, shortage of trained providers) barriers. Digital tools could improve this treatment gap by reducing the time and frequency of therapy sessions needed for effective treatment through the provision of flexible, automated support. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical effect of Mindset for Depression, a deployment-ready 8-week smartphone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) supported by brief teletherapy appointments with a therapist. METHODS: This 8-week, single-arm open trial tested the Mindset for Depression app when combined with 8 brief (16-25 minutes) video conferencing visits with a licensed doctoral-level CBT therapist (n=28 participants). The app offers flexible, accessible psychoeducation, CBT skills practice, and support to patients as well as clinician guidance to promote sustained engagement, monitor safety, and tailor treatment to individual patient needs. To increase accessibility and thus generalizability, all study procedures were conducted remotely. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed via attrition, patient expectations and feedback, and treatment utilization. The primary clinical outcome measure was the clinician-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, administered at pretreatment, midpoint, and posttreatment. Secondary measures of functional impairment and quality of life as well as maintenance of gains (3-month follow-up) were also collected. RESULTS: Treatment credibility (week 4), expectancy (week 4), and satisfaction (week 8) were moderate to high, and attrition was low (n=2, 7%). Participants self-reported using the app or practicing (either on or off the app) the CBT skills taught in the app for a median of 50 (IQR 30-60; week 4) or 60 (IQR 30-90; week 8) minutes per week; participants accessed the app on an average 36.8 (SD 10.0) days and completed a median of 7 of 8 (IQR 6-8) steps by the week 8 assessment. The app was rated positively across domains of engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information. Participants' depression severity scores decreased from an average Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score indicating moderate depression (mean 19.1, SD 5.0) at baseline to a week 8 mean score indicating mild depression (mean 10.8, SD 6.1; d=1.47; P<.001). Improvement was also observed for functional impairment and quality of life. Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that Mindset for Depression is a feasible and acceptable treatment option for individuals with major depressive disorder. This smartphone-led treatment holds promise to be an efficacious, scalable, and cost-effective treatment option. The next steps include testing Mindset for Depression in a fully powered randomized controlled trial and real-world clinical settings.

However, the design characteristics of such interventions have not been systematically reviewed. Considering that a lack of support-especially from a partner-is one of the major contributing factors to perinatal depression and anxiety, it is crucial to determine whether digital interventions have included partner participation. In this review, we systematically examined the design characteristics of digital interventions related to perinatal depression and anxiety and aimed to determine whether partner participation was incorporated as part of the interventions. Based on the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, five databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane, ProQuest, and Scopus) were searched. Narrative results of design characteristics were developed to provide a framework for the design and evaluation of the studies. A total of 12 intervention studies from China, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Norway, and the United Kingdom were included. Across all studies, internet cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness therapy were overwhelmingly utilized as the major intervention approaches. While all studies reported reduced depressive symptoms after the intervention, only four studies reported subsequent decreased levels of both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Only one study included partner support in the intervention. Cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness therapy, two of the most common intervention approaches, were found to be effective in alleviating perinatal depression and anxiety. Partner participation should be prioritized in designing digital interventions to ensure comprehensive and easily accessible social support for persons in need."
10.1186/s12906-023-04186-3,Third-wave cognitive behavioral therapies for caregivers of cancer patients: a scoping review,"Hong B, Yang S, Hyeon S, Kim S, Lee J.",BMC Complement Med Ther,2023,2023.10.11,,,"BACKGROUND: Cancer caregivers extend comprehensive support covering all aspects of patients' daily lives. It has been reported that a significant proportion of cancer caregivers experience emotional distress. As one way to solve this problem, third-wave cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), which involves integrating acceptance and mindfulness into cognitive‒behavioral therapy, has been applied to improve caregiver outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on the scoping review guidelines proposed by the Jonna Briggs Institute (JBI). The population was caregivers of cancer patients, the concept was third-wave CBT, and the context remained open. English and Korean publications published from 2001 to June 2022 were identified from PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Korea Med, and RISS. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were included in this scoping review. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) was the most frequently applied intervention (n = 3, each). Among the components of third-wave CBT, 'mindfulness' was identified in all the studies reviewed (n = 12). Dyadic interventions comprised the majority (n = 9). Interventions using digital technologies such as mobile application/web page (n = 3), telephone (n = 3), and FaceTime (n = 2) have increased since 2017. Depression was the most frequently evaluated outcome (n = 8), followed by anxiety and mindfulness (n = 6, each). CONCLUSIONS: The current review explored available third-wave CBT intervention studies for cancer caregivers and targeted outcomes. Most of the interventions were dyadic interventions and utilized mindfulness. Delivery methods were continuously updated with digital technologies. Further RCTs with robust research designs and a synthesis of the results of the trials would provide evidence about how to effectively apply third-wave CBTs for cancer caregivers."
10.2196/48467,Preliminary Efficacy of a Digital Intervention for Adolescent Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Peake E, Miller I, Flannery J, Chen L, Lake J, Padmanabhan A.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.2.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent depression is a significant public health concern; however, access to effective mental health care is limited. Digital therapeutics (DTx) can improve access to evidence-based interventions; however, their efficacy in adolescents is sparsely documented. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the efficacy of a mobile app DTx versus an active control as an adjunct treatment for adolescent depression symptoms. METHODS: An internet-based open-label randomized control trial was conducted nationwide with a partial crossover design, and 168 adolescents aged 13 to 21 years with symptoms of depression were recruited between November 2020 and September 2021. Participants were randomized (1:1) to the cognitive behavioral therapy-based treatment app (Spark) or to a psychoeducational control app (control), which they would use for a duration of 5 weeks. The primary outcome was a between-group (Spark vs control) difference in the change in depression symptoms from baseline to postintervention, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) using a linear mixed-effects analysis. The PHQ-8 ranges from 0 to 24, with scores of 5 to 9 indicating mild depression symptoms, scores of 10 to 14 indicating moderate symptoms, scores of 15 to 19 indicating moderately severe symptoms, and scores of 20 to 24 indicating severe symptoms. A minimal clinically important difference (5-point reduction between baseline and postintervention) in the Spark arm and group differences in remission and treatment response rates based on the PHQ-8 at postintervention were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 160 participants were randomized, 80 in the Spark arm (mean age 16.89, SD 2.5 y) and 80 in the control arm (mean age 16.79, SD 2.59 y). Data from 121 participants (Spark: n=63; control: n=58) with moderate to severe (PHQ-8≥10) symptoms at baseline were included in the primary analyses following a modified intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed-effect analysis revealed a nonsignificant difference between the study arms in depression symptom change over the intervention period. The Spark arm met a minimal clinically important difference threshold (mean -5.08, 95% CI -6.72 to -3.42). The remission rate in the Spark arm was significantly higher than that in the control arm (11/63, 17% vs 2/58, 3%; χ21=6.2; P=.01; false discovery rate-adjusted P=.03). The treatment response rates were not significantly different between the study arms (P=.07; false discovery rate-adjusted P=.16). Post hoc analyses including participants with mild to severe (PHQ-8 score ≥5) symptoms at baseline revealed promising evidence that Spark is effective in those with mild to severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There is initial evidence that a self-guided, cognitive behavioral therapy-based DTx intervention may effectively treat mild to severe depression symptoms in adolescents.

,"Behavioral Activation Contributed to the Total Reduction of Depression Symptoms in the Smartphone-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized, Controlled Trial","Imai H, Yamada M, Inagaki M, Watanabe N, Chino B, Mantani A, Furukawa TA.",Innov Clin Neurosci,2020,2021.2.1,,,"Objective: The contribution of components in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to the total reduction of depression symptoms has not been well elucidated, and previous studies couldn't exclude the human factors in the therapy. Design: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial comparing automated smartphone CBT without human factors plus antidepressant switch against antidepressant switch alone among patients with antidepressant-resistant depression. The present CBT consisted of self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring. We used linear regression to predict the overall pre- to post-symptom improvement based on improvement achieved by sessions teaching each cognitive or behavioral skill. The overall improvement was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the session-to-session improvement with K6. Results: Of the 164 participants originally enrolled in the study, 94 participants who completed all K6 evaluation were included in the primary analyses. The results indicated that K6 score reduction in the first half of behavioral activation significantly predicted BDI-II score reduction. The sensitivity analysis including 162 participants did not change the result. K6 score reductions after other CBT sessions did not significantly predict BDI-II score reduction. Conclusion: The behavioral activation seems to contribute to the total reduction of depressive symptoms even if human factors are excluded by using automated smartphone CBT."
10.2196/56960,Evaluating the Efficacy of a Digital Therapeutic (CT-152) as an Adjunct to Antidepressant Treatment in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder: Protocol for the MIRAI Remote Study,"Rothman B, Slomkowski M, Speier A, Rush AJ, Trivedi MH, Lawson E, Fahmy M, Carpenter D, Chen D, Forbes A.",JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024.8.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common worldwide and can be highly disabling. People with MDD face many barriers to treatment and may not experience full symptom relief even when treated. Therefore, new treatment modalities are needed for MDD. Digital therapeutics (DTx) may provide people with MDD an additional treatment option. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe a phase 3 remote, multicenter, randomized, masked, sham-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a smartphone app-based DTx (CT-152) in adult participants diagnosed with MDD, used as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy (ADT). METHODS: Participants aged 22-64 years with a current primary diagnosis of MDD and an inadequate response to ADT were included. Participants were randomized 1:1 to CT-152 or a sham DTx. CT-152 is a smartphone app-based DTx that delivers a cognitive-emotional and behavioral therapeutic intervention. The core components of CT-152 are the Emotional Faces Memory Task exercises, brief lessons to learn and apply key therapeutic skills, and SMS text messaging to reinforce lessons and encourage engagement with the app. The sham DTx is a digital working memory exercise with emotionally neutral stimuli designed to match CT-152 for time and attention. Participants took part in the trial for up to 13 weeks. The trial included a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period of 6 weeks, and an extension period of 4 weeks to assess the durability of the effect. Sites and participants had the option of an in-person or remote screening visit; the remaining trial visits were remote. Efficacy was evaluated using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. The durability of the effect was evaluated with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Adverse events were also assessed. Satisfaction, measured by the Participant and Healthcare Professional Satisfaction Scales, and health status, measured by the EQ-5D-5L, were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: This study was initiated in February 2021 and had a primary completion date in October 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the methodological design for the first evaluation of CT-152 as an adjunct to ADT. This study protocol is methodologically robust and incorporates many aspects of conventional pivotal pharmaceutical phase 3 trial design, such as randomization and safety end points. Novel considerations included the use of a sham comparator, masking considerations for visible app content, and outcome measures relevant to DTx. The rigor of this methodology will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of CT-152.

10.1371/journal.pone.0126559,Smartphone-Supported versus Full Behavioural Activation for Depression: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Ly KH, Topooco N, Cederlund H, Wallin A, Bergström J, Molander O, Carlbring P, Andersson G.",PLoS One,2015,2015.5.27,,,"BACKGROUND: There is need for more cost and time effective treatments for depression. This is the first randomised controlled trial in which a blended treatment--including four face-to-face sessions and a smartphone application--was compared against a full behavioural treatment. Hence, the aim of the current paper was to examine whether a blended smartphone treatment was non-inferior to a full behavioural activation treatment for depression. METHODS: This was a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial (NCT01819025) comparing a blended treatment (n=46) against a full ten-session treatment (n=47) for people suffering from major depression. Primary outcome measure was the BDI-II, that was administered at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six months after the treatment. RESULTS: Results showed significant improvements in both groups across time on the primary outcome measure (within-group Cohen's d=1.35; CI [-0.82, 3.52] to d=1.47; CI [-0.41, 3.35]; between group d=-0.13 CI [-2.37, 2.09] and d=-0.10 CI [-2.53, 2.33]). At the same time, the blended treatment reduced the therapist time with an average of 47%. CONCLUSIONS: We could not establish whether the blended treatment was non-inferior to a full BA treatment. Nevertheless, this study points to that the blended treatment approach could possibly treat nearly twice as many patients suffering from depression by using a smartphone application as add-on. More studies are needed before we can suggest that the blended treatment method is a promising cost-effective alternative to regular face-to-face treatment for depression.

However, no study has been conducted on whether Todac Todac is effective in dialysis patients. Therefore, this study was intended to determine whether the use of this app was effective in improving depression in dialysis patients. Sixty-five end-stage kidney disease patients receiving dialysis at Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital were randomly assigned to the Todac Todac app program (experimental group) or an E-moods daily mood chart app program (control group) for 3 weeks. The degree of depression was measured before and after using the app.After the end of the 3-week program, a small but significant improvement was observed in the Trait anxiety (p < 0.05) and Beck depression index (p < 0.05) in E-moods group and DAS-K scores (p < 0.05) in Todac Todac group. However, no differences were seen in any parameters between the two groups. In addition, Todac Todac was not statistically more effective than the control intervention in the subgroup analysis. The Todac Todac, a scenario-based cognitive behavioral therapy mobile app, seemed to have a limited effect on improving depression in dialysis patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new tools to improve depression in dialysis patients."

Digital behavioral activation interventions, with or without coaching support, hold promise for addressing risk factors for both mental and physical health problems by offering scalable approaches to expand access to evidence-based mental health support. OBJECTIVE: This 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated 2 versions of a digital behavioral health product, Vira (Ksana Health Inc), for their feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness in improving mental health in young adults with depressive symptoms and obesity risk factors. METHODS: A total of 73 participants recruited throughout the United States were randomly assigned to use Vira either as a self-guided product (Vira Self-Care) or with support from a health coach (Vira+Coaching) for 12 weeks. The Vira smartphone app used passive sensing of behavioral data related to mental health and obesity risk factors (ie, activity, sleep, mobility, and language patterns) and offered users personalized insights into patterns of behavior associated with their daily mood. Participants completed self-reported outcome measures at baseline and follow-up (12 weeks). All study procedures were completed via digital communications. RESULTS: Both versions of Vira showed strong user engagement, acceptability, and evidence of effectiveness in improving mental health and stress. However, users receiving coaching exhibited more sustained engagement with the platform and reported greater reductions in depression (Cohen d=0.45, 95% CI 0.10-0.82) and anxiety (Cohen d=0.50, 95% CI 0.13-0.86) compared to self-care users. Both interventions also resulted in reduced stress (Vira+Coaching: Cohen d=-1.05, 95% CI -1.57 to --0.50; Vira Self-Care: Cohen d=-0.78, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.23) and were perceived as useful and easy to use. Coached users also reported reductions in sleep-related impairment (Cohen d=-0.51, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.01). Moreover, participants increased their motivation for and confidence in making behavioral changes, with greater improvements in confidence among coached users. CONCLUSIONS: An app-based intervention using passive mobile sensing to track behavior and deliver personalized insights into behavior-mood associations demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness for reducing depressive symptoms and other mental health problems in young adults. Future directions include (1) optimizing the interventions, (2) conducting a fully powered trial that includes an active control condition, and (3) testing mediators and moderators of outcome effects.

10.2196/44029,Testing a Behavioral Activation Gaming App for Depression During Pregnancy: Multimethod Pilot Study,"Vanderkruik RC, Ferguson C, Kobylski LA, Locascio JJ, Hamlett GE, Killenberg PC, Lewis R, Jones N, Rossa ET, Dineen H, Picard R, Cohen LS.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.1.26,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression during pregnancy is increasingly recognized as a worldwide public health problem. If untreated, there can be detrimental outcomes for the mother and child. Anxiety is also often comorbid with depression. Although effective treatments exist, most women do not receive treatment. Technology is a mechanism to increase access to and engagement in mental health services. OBJECTIVE: The Guardians is a mobile app, grounded in behavioral activation principles, which seeks to leverage mobile game mechanics and in-game rewards to encourage user engagement. This study seeks to assess app satisfaction and engagement and to explore changes in clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety among a sample of pregnant women with elevated depressive symptoms. METHODS: This multimethod pilot test consisted of a single-arm, proof-of-concept trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of The Guardians among a pregnant sample with depression (N=18). Participation included two web-based study visits: (1) a baseline assessment to collect demographic and obstetric information and to assess clinical symptoms and (2) an exit interview to administer follow-up measures and explore user experience. Participants completed biweekly questionnaires (ie, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) during the trial to assess depression and anxiety symptom severity. App satisfaction was measured using 2 self-report scales (ie, Mobile Application Rating Scale and Player Experience of Needs Satisfaction scale). Engagement with The Guardians was captured using game interaction metric data. We used backward-eliminated mixed effects longitudinal models to examine the effects of app engagement and satisfaction and length of time in the study on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Content analysis was conducted on qualitative data from exit interviews. RESULTS: The 15-day and 30-day overall app retention rates were 26.6% and 15.1%, respectively. Mixed effects models found significant negative main effects of week in study (β=-.35; t61=-3.05; P=.003), number of activities completed (β=-.12; t61=-2.05; P=.04), days played (β=-.12; t58=-2.9; P=.005), and satisfaction, according to the Mobile Application Rating Scale (β=-3.05; t45=-2.19; P=.03) on depressive symptoms. We have reported about similar analyses for anxiety. There is preliminary evidence suggesting harder activities are associated with greater mood improvement than easier activities. Qualitative content analysis resulted in feedback falling under the following themes: activities, app design, engagement, fit of the app with lifestyle, perceived impact of the app on mood, and suggestions for app modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results from this multimethod study of The Guardians indicate feasibility and acceptability among pregnant women with depression. Retention and engagement levels were more than double those of previous public mental health apps, and use of the app was associated with significant decrease in depressive symptom scores over the 10-week trial. The Guardians shows promise as an effective and scalable digital intervention to support women experiencing depression."

The combination of digital tools and live human connection may hold particular promise for resonating with and flexibly supporting young people's mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the BeMe app-based platform to support adolescents' mental health and well-being and to examine app engagement, usability, and satisfaction. METHODS: Adolescents in the United States, aged 13 to 20 years, were recruited via the web and enrolled between September 1 and October 31, 2022. App engagement, feature use, clinical functioning, and satisfaction with BeMe were examined for 30 days. BeMe provides content based on cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, motivational interviewing, and positive psychology; interactive activities; live text-based coaching; links to clinical services; and crisis support tools (digital and live). RESULTS: The average age of the sample (N=13,421) was 15.04 (SD 1.7) years, and 56.72% (7612/13,421) identified with she/her pronouns. For the subsample that completed the in-app assessments, the mean scores indicated concern for depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire mean 15.68/20, SD 5.9; n=239), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire mean 13.37/17, SD 5.0; n=791), and poor well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-being Index mean 30.15/100, SD 16.1; n=1923). Overall, the adolescents engaged with BeMe for an average of 2.38 (SD 2.7) days in 7.94 (SD 24.1) sessions and completed 11.26 (SD 19.8) activities. Most adolescents engaged with BeMe's content (12,270/13,421, 91.42%), mood ratings (13,094/13,421, 97.56%), and interactive skills (10,098/13,421, 75.24%), and almost one-fifth of the adolescents engaged with coaching (2539/13,421, 18.92%), clinical resources (2411/13,421, 17.96%), and crisis support resources (2499/13,421, 18.62%). Overall app engagement (total activities) was highest among female and gender-neutral adolescents compared with male adolescents (all P<.001) and was highest among younger adolescents (aged 13-14 years) compared with all other ages (all P<.001). Satisfaction ratings were generally high for content (eg, 158/176, 89.8% rated as helpful and 1044/1139, 91.66% improved coping self-efficacy), activities (5362/8468, 63.32% helpful and 4408/6072, 72.6% useful in coping with big feelings), and coaching (747/894, 83.6% helpful and 747/894, 83.6% improved coping self-efficacy). Engagement (total activities completed) predicted the likelihood of app satisfaction (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents downloaded the BeMe app and completed multiple sessions and activities. Engagement with BeMe was higher among female and younger adolescents. Ratings of BeMe's content, activities, and coaching were very positive for cognitive precursors aimed at reducing depression and anxiety and improving well-being. The findings will inform future app development to promote more sustained engagement, and future evaluations will assess the effects of BeMe on changes in mental health outcomes."

However, many commercially available apps have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation of effectiveness, particularly among users experiencing clinically significant symptomatology. We examined depression and anxiety symptom outcomes associated with a top-rated, commercially available self-guided DMHI based on cognitive behavioral therapy (""Sanvello"") relative to waitlist control. METHODS: This preregistered web-based, 2-arm, parallel-group randomized trial enrolled U.S. adults with self-reported elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Those assigned to the treatment condition were provided 8 weeks of access to Sanvello. Co-primary outcomes of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale [GAD-7]) severity were assessed at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses included 280 participants (mean age 32.47 ± 9.32 years; 86.1 % women). Generalized linear mixed models showed a significant improvement in depression (F(4,779) = 6.51, p < .001) and anxiety (F(4,907) = 3.28, p = .01) associated with the DMHI over time. The intervention was also associated with a greater proportion of participants exhibiting depression response (25 [45.5 %] vs 26 [16.9 %]) and remission (10 [18.2 %] vs 7 [4.5 %]) on the PHQ-9, and anxiety response (31 [44.9 %] vs 39 [22.8 %]) and remission (20 [29.0 %] vs 27 [15.8 %]) on the GAD-7, relative to waitlist. LIMITATIONS: Findings may not represent people with serious mental illness, suicidality, or the broader population of DMHI users. CONCLUSIONS: A commercially available, self-guided DMHI was effective at improving symptoms in individuals experiencing depression or anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT05373329]."
10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.22115,Comparative Effectiveness of Three Digital Interventions for Adults Seeking Psychiatric Services: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Horwitz AG, Mills ED, Sen S, Bohnert ASB.",JAMA Netw Open,2024,2024.7.18,,,"IMPORTANCE: There is a substantial gap between demand for and availability of mental health services. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are promising tools for bridging this gap, yet little is known about their comparative effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients randomized to a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based or mindfulness-based DMHI had greater improvements in mental health symptoms than patients randomized to the enhanced personalized feedback (EPF)-only DMHI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted between May 13, 2020, and December 12, 2022, with follow-up at 6 weeks. Adult patients of outpatient psychiatry services across various clinics within the University of Michigan Health System with a scheduled or recent outpatient psychiatry appointment were recruited. Eligible patients were randomized to an intervention arm. All analyses followed the intent-to-treat principle. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 intervention arms: (1) EPF only; (2) Silvercloud only, a mobile application designed to deliver CBT strategies; (3) Silvercloud plus EPF; (4) Headspace only, a mobile application designed to train users in mindfulness practices; and (5) Headspace plus EPF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; score range: 0-27, with higher scores indicating greater depression symptoms). Secondary outcomes included changes in anxiety, suicidality, and substance use symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 2079 participants (mean [SD] age, 36.8 [14.3] years; 1423 self-identified as women [68.4%]) completed the baseline survey. The baseline mean (SD) PHQ-9 score was 12.7 (6.4) and significantly decreased for all 5 intervention arms at 6 weeks (from -2.1 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.7] to -2.9 [95% CI, -3.4 to -2.4]; n = 1885). The magnitude of change was not significantly different across the 5 arms (F4,1879 = 1.19; P = .31). Additionally, the groups did not differ in decrease in anxiety or substance use symptoms. However, the Headspace arms reported significantly greater improvements on a suicidality measure subscale compared with the Silvercloud arms (mean difference in mean change = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.20-1.06; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms across all DMHIs and minimal evidence that specific applications were better than others. The findings suggest that DMHIs may provide support for patients during waiting list-related delays in care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04342494."
10.1016/j.invent.2019.100296,A mobile application for panic disorder and agoraphobia: Insights from a multi-methods feasibility study,"Ebenfeld L, Kleine Stegemann S, Lehr D, Ebert DD, Funk B, Riper H, Berking M.",Internet Interv,2019,2020.1.1,,,"BACKGROUND: Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD) is a common psychological disorder. Internet-based interventions have the potential to offer highly scalable low-threshold evidence-based care to people suffering from PD. GET.ON Panic is a newly developed internet-based intervention addressing symptoms of PD. In order to transfer the training into the daily life of the individuals, we integrated mobile components in the training and created a so-called hybrid online training. The development and beta-testing of such a training requires a novel interdisciplinary approach between IT specialists and psychologists. From this point of view, we would like to share our experiences in this exploratory paper. METHODS: This initial feasibility study (N = 10) offers, on the one hand, a brief overview of the interdisciplinary development phase of the mobile application and on the other hand, provides first insights into the usage, usability and acceptance of this mobile application using qualitative interview data as well quantitative measures of 8 completing participants. For these reasons, we used a pre-posttest design without a control group. Furthermore, we present initial clinical outcomes of the intervention on e.g. panic symptom severity, depressive symptoms as well additional anxiety measures. Finally, we end with implications for further research in the relatively new field of mobile mental health. RESULTS: Overall, usability, user satisfaction, motivational value and technology acceptance of the app were perceived as high. The usage of app components was diverse: The use of interoceptive exposure exercises and daily summaries on anxiety and mood was highest while using in-vivo exposure exercises and monitoring panic symptoms was perceived as difficult. Furthermore, participants showed after the training less clinical symptoms as at baseline-assessment. DISCUSSION: The current feasibility study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the potential of mobile technology in e-mental health. Overall, the GET.ON Panic app appears to be an acceptable and motivational part of a CBT-based hybrid online training for PD that has the potential to promote training success. After some suggested adjustments have been made, the efficacy should be investigated in a randomized controlled trial."

However, CBT is associated with significant patient dropout and lacks the means to provide objective data regarding a patient's experience and symptoms between sessions. Emerging wearables and mobile health (mHealth) applications represent an approach that may provide objective data to the patient and provider between CBT sessions. Here, we describe the development of a classifier of real-time physiological stress in a healthy population (n = 35) and apply it in a controlled clinical evaluation for armed forces veterans undergoing CBT for stress and anger management (n = 16). Using cardiovascular and electrodermal inputs from a wearable device, the classifier was able to detect physiological stress in a non-clinical sample with accuracy greater than 90%. In a small clinical sample, patients who used the classifier and an associated mHealth application were less likely to discontinue therapy (p = 0.016, d = 1.34) and significantly improved on measures of stress (p = 0.032, d = 1.61), anxiety (p = 0.050, d = 1.26), and anger (p = 0.046, d = 1.41) compared to controls undergoing CBT alone. Given the large number of individuals that experience mental health disorders and the unmet need for treatment, especially in developing nations, such mHealth approaches have the potential to provide or augment treatment at low cost in the absence of in-person care."

Randomized clinical trials and preliminary real-world evidence have shown that digitally delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is associated with improvements in insomnia, but real-world evidence is needed to determine the true impact of digital CBT-I. This pragmatic study aimed to evaluate the benefits of treating chronic insomnia with a tailored prescription digital therapeutic in a real-world population. METHODS: This prospective, single-arm clinical study involved adults aged 22-75 with chronic insomnia living in the US who had access to a mobile device. Participants accessed the FDA-cleared prescription digital therapeutic (PDT; Somryst®) over a 9-week intervention period. The PDT delivers cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia via six interactive treatment cores and daily sleep diaries used for tailoring treatment. Participants completed validated patient-reported instruments at baseline, before completing treatment cores, immediately post-intervention, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. The Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8], and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7] were used to determine the effect of the PDT on insomnia, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: After screening, 1565 adults accessed the PDT. 58% of those who began the program completed Core 4, established as exposure to all mechanisms of action in the digital therapeutic. For those who completed assessments for all 6 cores (48.4%), the ISI was lowered from 18.8 to a mean of 9.9 (P <.001). These scores continued to be lower than baseline at immediate post (11.0), 6-month (11.6), and 1-year follow-ups (12.2) (P <.001). The results of the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 also show significant decreases at all measured timepoints from baseline (P <.001). Of the patients that began the program, 908 (58.0%) were considered adherent and 733 (46.8%) completed all 6 cores. CONCLUSION: Data from the DREAM study contributes to the growing body of clinical evidence of how patients are utilizing a PDT in the real world, outside of controlled settings, offering insights for clinicians who use these therapeutics in practice.

Integrating behavioral health technology into medical clinic workflows could overcome these barriers. We evaluated the feasibility and impact of a coached digital CBI (dCBI) as a first-line intervention in a prospective cohort of emotionally distressed patients with FGID. METHODS: Patients with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms were offered a dCBI (an app called RxWell) during routine clinic visits. RxWell provides cognitive behavioral techniques enhanced by within-app text messaging with a health coach. Both gastroenterology and behavioral health-care providers electronically prescribed RxWell. We tracked patient interactions with RxWell, and patients completed anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (Personal Health Questionniare Depression Scale) measures through the app. Our primary study outcome was the change in General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Personal Health Questionniare Depression Scale scores. RESULTS: Of 364 patients with FGID (mean age 43 years [SD 16 years]; 73.1% women) prescribed the dCBI, 48.4% enrolled (median use, 3 techniques [interquartile range 1-14]). About half of RxWell enrollees communicated with health coaches. The mean baseline anxiety score was 11.4 (SD 5.5), and the depression score was 11.5 (SD 6.1). RxWell users experienced improvements in anxiety (mean change 2.71 [t = 3.7, df = 58; P < 0.001]) and depression (mean change 2.9 [t = 4.2, df = 45; P < 0.001]) at 4 months. DISCUSSION: Patients with FGIDs and moderately severe anxiety and depressive symptoms are willing to use dCBI tools recommended by their providers. Our pilot data demonstrate that dCBI usage is associated with clinically and statistically significant mood symptom reductions."

The development of treatments that overcome barriers to accessing treatment remains an important area of clinical research as most people delay or do not receive treatment at an appropriate time. The workplace is an ideal setting to roll-out an intervention, particularly given the substantial psychological benefits associated with remaining in the workforce. Mobile health (mhealth) interventions utilising smartphone applications (apps) offer novel solutions to disseminating evidence based programs, however few apps have undergone rigorous testing. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app designed to treat depressive symptoms in workers. METHODS: The present study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), comparing the effectiveness of the intervention to that of an attention control. The primary outcome measured will be reduced depressive symptoms at 3 months. Secondary outcomes such as wellbeing and work performance will also be measured. Employees from a range of industries will be recruited via a mixture of targeted social media advertising and Industry partners. Participants will be included if they present with likely current depression at baseline. Following baseline assessment (administered within the app), participants will be randomised to receive one of two versions of the Headgear application: 1) Intervention (a 30-day mental health intervention focusing on behavioural activation and mindfulness), or 2) attention control app (mood monitoring for 30 days). Participants will be blinded to their allocation. Analyses will be conducted within an intention to treat framework using mixed modelling. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide valuable information about the effectiveness of mhealth interventions in the treatment of depressive symptoms in a workplace context. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The current trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12617000547347 , Registration date: 19/04/2017)."

Mobile app-based meditation is a feasible, accessible, and effective self-care solution for depression among neurotypical adults, but there is limited evidence for the long-term benefits of app-based meditation among autistic adults. Habits are a key behavioral strategy for maintaining behavior change, and anchoring is one effective habit formation intervention that has yet to be tested among autistic adults. This study demonstrates that it is both feasible and effective to integrate the anchoring habit formation strategy into an app-based meditation intervention for establishing meditation habits among autistic adults. In addition, the study shows that app-based meditation habits were successful at maintaining reductions in depressive symptoms over 6 months. These results demonstrate the power of anchoring-based habit formation interventions for establishing healthy habits among autistic adults, which offers a promising behavioral intervention technique for establishing other healthy habits among autistic adults. The study also shows that app-based meditation habits are an effective long-term self-care solution for managing depressive symptoms among autistic adults that should be used by mental health providers and policymakers. Future research should test this combined anchoring and app-based meditation intervention technique among larger samples of autistic adults and over longer durations to better understand the mechanisms underlying the success of this intervention."

This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the efficacy of internet- and mobile-based interventions for post-acute care in these conditions. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycEXTRA, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Open, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and Open Grey) for randomized controlled trials evaluating digital aftercare or relapse prevention interventions for adults with anxiety or depressive disorders. Primary outcomes included symptom severity, relapse rates, recurrence rates, and rehospitalization. Secondary outcomes included general quality of life and adherence to primary treatment. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (3,206 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based approaches, and supportive text messaging. Most studies focused on depression, with limited evidence for anxiety disorders. Notably, fourteen studies that reported on depressive symptoms demonstrated significant improvements following digital interventions, with effect sizes ranging from small (Cohen's d = 0.20) to large (Cohen's d = 0.80). Five studies investigated relapse or recurrence rates, yielding mixed results. Adherence rates varied significantly across studies, ranging from 50 to 92.3%, highlighting the variability in participant engagement. Methodological quality was also variable, with allocation concealment and blinding being common limitations. CONCLUSION: Internet- and mobile-based interventions show promise for aftercare and relapse prevention in depression, with limited evidence for anxiety disorders. Future research should focus on optimizing engagement, personalizing interventions, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting larger trials with longer follow-up periods. These findings have important implications for integrating digital tools into existing care pathways to improve long-term outcomes for individuals with anxiety and depressive disorders.

Some barriers to postpartum depression care uncover the need for more easily accessible and lower-cost interventions. Chile's high utilization of digital technologies across all social strata and the increased use of pregnancy and parenting apps open the possibility of delivering interventions through mobile devices. Cognitive-behavioral internet-based interventions have proven to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in high-income countries. However, in Chile, this is an underdeveloped field. This manuscript describes a randomized controlled trial protocol that will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a guided 8-week cognitive-behavioral app-based intervention for Chilean postpartum women with depressive symptoms. METHOD: A small-scale parallel 2-arms trial will be conducted. Postpartum women with minor or major depression will be randomized to the app-based intervention or waitlist. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability variables, mainly; recruitment and eligibility rates, intervention and study adherence, and participants' intervention satisfaction, use, and engagement. Semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample will provide more information about the participants' experience with the intervention. Women's depression status will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Other secondary outcomes will include participants' perceived social support, mother-infant bonding, and maternal satisfaction and self-efficacy. DISCUSSION: This will be the first internet-based intervention aimed at reducing postpartum depression symptoms developed and studied in Chile. If the intervention and procedures prove feasible and acceptable, we plan to study its efficacy in a definitive controlled trial. If the intervention demonstrates to be effective, the aim is to implement it within the Chilean healthcare setting."

Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) have been shown to be effective but are usually provided as packages of various skills. Little research has been done to investigate whether all their components are beneficial and contributory to mental health promotion. We addressed this issue by developing a smartphone CBT app that implements five representative CBT skills (behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, assertion training and behavior therapy for insomnia), and conducting a master randomized study that included four 2 × 2 factorial trials to enable precise estimation of skill-specific efficacies. Between September 2022 and February 2024, we recruited 3,936 adult participants with subthreshold depression. Among those randomized, the follow-up rate was 97% at week 6 and adherence to the app was 84%. The study showed that all included CBT skills and their combinations differentially beat all three control conditions of delayed treatment, health information or self-check, with effect sizes ranging between -0.67 (95% confidence interval: -0.81 to -0.53) and -0.16 (-0.30 to -0.02) for changes in depressive symptom severity from baseline to week 6, as measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Knowledge of the active ingredients of CBT can better inform the design of more effective and scalable psychotherapies in the future. (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000047124 )."
10.2196/19237,Digital and Mobile Technologies to Promote Physical Health Behavior Change and Provide Psychological Support for Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: Meta-Ethnography and Systematic Review,"Robinson A, Oksuz U, Slight R, Slight S, Husband A.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020.12.1,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital technology has influenced many aspects of modern living, including health care. In the context of elective surgeries, there is a strong association between preoperative physical and psychological preparedness, and improved postoperative outcomes. Health behavior changes made in the pre- and postoperative periods can be fundamental in determining the outcomes and success of elective surgeries. Understanding the potential unmet needs of patients undergoing elective surgery is central to motivating health behavior change. Integrating digital and mobile health technologies within the elective surgical pathway could be a strategy to remotely deliver this support to patients. OBJECTIVE: This meta-ethnographic systematic review explores digital interventions supporting patients undergoing elective surgery with health behavior changes, specifically physical activity, weight loss, dietary intake, and psychological support. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in October 2019 across 6 electronic databases (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO]: CRD42020157813). Qualitative studies were included if they evaluated the use of digital technologies supporting behavior change in adult patients undergoing elective surgery during the pre- or postoperative period. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. A meta-ethnographic approach was used to synthesize existing qualitative data, using the 7 phases of meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare. Using this approach, along with reciprocal translation, enabled the development of 4 themes from the data. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included covering bariatric (n=2, 11%), cancer (n=13, 72%), and orthopedic (n=3, 17%) surgeries. The 4 overarching themes appear to be key in understanding and determining the effectiveness of digital and mobile interventions to support surgical patients. To successfully motivate health behavior change, technologies should provide motivation and support, enable patient engagement, facilitate peer networking, and meet individualized patient needs. Self-regulatory features such as goal setting heightened patient motivation. The personalization of difficulty levels in virtual reality-based rehabilitation was positively received. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy reduced depression and distress in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Peer networking provided emotional support beyond that of patient-provider relationships, improving quality of life and care satisfaction. Patients expressed the desire for digital interventions to be individually tailored according to their physical and psychological needs, before and after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have the potential to influence the future design of patient-centered digital and mobile health technologies and demonstrate a multipurpose role for digital technologies in the elective surgical pathway by motivating health behavior change and offering psychological support. Through the synthesis of patient suggestions, we highlight areas for digital technology optimization and emphasize the importance of content tailored to suit individual patients and surgical procedures. There is a significant rationale for involving patients in the cocreation of digital health technologies to enhance engagement, better support behavior change, and improve surgical outcomes."

This study examined the acceptability and initial efficacy of an app-enhanced Unified Protocol for Adolescents [UP-A] when including youth with more severe mood disorders or psychotic spectrum disorders. METHODS: We first adapted a mobile application (app), based on user-centered feedback from adolescents and their parents, to assist participants in reviewing session content, practicing skills learned in previous treatment sessions, and monitoring symptomatic progress. A total of 24 adolescents (M age = 15.2 years, SD = 1.6) with mood or psychotic spectrum disorders and their parents then participated in an open trial of the app-enhanced group treatment given over 9 weekly sessions. RESULTS: Adolescent participants and their parents rated the group treatment and mobile app as acceptable and useful. We observed significant improvements over the 9-week treatment in adolescents' depressive symptoms, attenuated psychotic symptoms, and global functioning. The frequency with which adolescents used the mobile app between sessions was positively related to symptomatic and functional gains. CONCLUSIONS: Initial findings suggest the acceptability and feasibility of a mobile app that enabled adolescent participants and their parents to review session content and practice treatment skills. Findings also indicated improvements in psychiatric and functional outcomes among the adolescent participants over the course of the app-enhanced treatment. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of app-enhanced CBT in improving symptoms and functioning in adolescents with mood or psychotic spectrum disorders."
10.2196/mental.4984,Mental Health Smartphone Apps: Review and Evidence-Based Recommendations for Future Developments,"Bakker D, Kazantzis N, Rickwood D, Rickard N.",JMIR Ment Health,2016,2016.3.3,,,"BACKGROUND: The number of mental health apps (MHapps) developed and now available to smartphone users has increased in recent years. MHapps and other technology-based solutions have the potential to play an important part in the future of mental health care; however, there is no single guide for the development of evidence-based MHapps. Many currently available MHapps lack features that would greatly improve their functionality, or include features that are not optimized. Furthermore, MHapp developers rarely conduct or publish trial-based experimental validation of their apps. Indeed, a previous systematic review revealed a complete lack of trial-based evidence for many of the hundreds of MHapps available. OBJECTIVE: To guide future MHapp development, a set of clear, practical, evidence-based recommendations is presented for MHapp developers to create better, more rigorous apps. METHODS: A literature review was conducted, scrutinizing research across diverse fields, including mental health interventions, preventative health, mobile health, and mobile app design. RESULTS: Sixteen recommendations were formulated. Evidence for each recommendation is discussed, and guidance on how these recommendations might be integrated into the overall design of an MHapp is offered. Each recommendation is rated on the basis of the strength of associated evidence. It is important to design an MHapp using a behavioral plan and interactive framework that encourages the user to engage with the app; thus, it may not be possible to incorporate all 16 recommendations into a single MHapp. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials are required to validate future MHapps and the principles upon which they are designed, and to further investigate the recommendations presented in this review. Effective MHapps are required to help prevent mental health problems and to ease the burden on health systems."

METHODS: A two-armed randomized-controlled trial recruiting from LTC charities. Participants with anxiety and/or depression symptoms related to their LTC(s) were randomized (concealed allocation via independent administrator) to COMPASS (access to 11 tailored modules plus five thirty-minute therapist support sessions) or standard charity support (SCS). Assessments were completed online pre-randomization, at 6- and 12-weeks post-randomization. Primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale; PHQ-ADS measured at 12-weeks. Analysis used intention-to-treat principles with adjusted mean differences estimated using linear mixed-effects models. Data-analyst was blinded to group allocation. RESULTS: 194 participants were randomized to COMPASS (N = 94) or SCS (N = 100). At 12-weeks, mean level of psychological distress was 6.82 (95% confidence interval; CI 4.55-9.10) points lower (p < 0.001) in the COMPASS arm compared with SCS (standardized mean difference of 0.71 (95% CI 0.48-0.95)). The COMPASS arm also showed moderate significant treatment effects on secondary outcomes including depression, anxiety and illness-related distress and small significant effects on functioning and quality-of-life. Rates of adverse events were comparable across the arms. Deterioration in distress at 12-weeks was observed in 2.2% of the SCS arm, and no participants in the COMPASS arm. CONCLUSION: Compared with SCS, COMPASS digital therapeutic with minimal therapist input reduces psychological distress at post-treatment (12-weeks). COMPASS offers a potentially scalable implementation model for health services but its translation to these contexts needs further evaluating. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04535778."

If not treated, it may negatively affect a person's everyday life by altering physical and social well-being and productivity and increasing expenditure on health care. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions are gaining popularity as a means to reduce stress and alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms. Moreover, CBT delivered through a mobile app has the same elements as traditional CBT training (eg, guided discovery). However, unlike conventional training, users of mobile apps are allowed to tailor their own experience at their own speed and schedule. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze Sensa users' retrospective data and explore the dose-duration effect to find the optimal usage time when the user showed results. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 381 consecutive community-based nonclinical users who started using Sensa between October 2021 and March 2022. All users included in the study took the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) assessment at least 2 times. Other parameters from the database containing all self-reported data were gender, number of active days, total time of use, and age. The primary outcome of the study was a change in the DASS-21 score. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 9, GraphPad Software). In addition, a logistic regression model was created to predict how the obtained independent parameters influenced the DASS-21 score. RESULTS: The main finding of our study was that the majority of participants who started using Sensa were experiencing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (92.13%, 80.05%, and 87.93%, respectively). There was a statistically significant decrease of the DASS-21 subdomain scores after the use of the application (anxiety: mean 7.25, SD 4.03 vs mean 6.12, SD 4.00; P=.001; depression: mean 11.05, SD 4.26 vs mean 9.01, SD 4.77; P=.001; stress: mean 11.42, SD 3.44 vs mean 9.96, SD 3.65; P<.001). Finally, the logistic regression model showed that users who were using the app for more than 24 days and had at least 12 active days during that time had 3.463 (95% CI 1.142-11.93) and 2.644 (95% CI 1.024-7.127) times higher chances to reduce their DASS-21 subdomain scores of depression and anxiety, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Sensa mobile app was related to decreased depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform an economic evaluation of a mobile diary app compared with paper-based diary cards in DBT treatment for patients with borderline personality disorder in a psychiatric outpatient facility. METHODS: This study was conducted alongside a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The participants were recruited at 5 Danish psychiatric outpatient facilities and were randomized to register the emotions, urges, and skills used in a mobile diary app or on paper-based diary cards. The participants in both groups received DBT delivered by the therapists. A cost-consequence analysis with a time horizon of 12 months was performed. Consequences included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), depression severity, borderline severity, suicidal behavior, health care use, treatment compliance, and system usability. All relevant costs were included. Focus group interviews were conducted with patients, therapists, researchers, and industry representatives to discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of using a mobile diary app. RESULTS: A total of 78 participants were included in the analysis. An insignificantly higher number of participants in the paper group dropped out before the start of treatment (P=.07). Of those starting treatment, participants in the app group had an average of 37.1 (SE 27.55) more days of treatment and recorded an average of 3.16 (SE 5.10) more skills per week than participants in the paper group. Participants in both groups had a QALY gain and a decrease in depression severity, borderline severity, and suicidal behavior. Significant differences were found in favor of the paper group for both QALY gain (adjusted difference -0.054; SE 0.03) and reduction in depression severity (adjusted difference -1.11; SE 1.57). The between-group difference in total costs ranged from US $107.37 to US $322.10 per participant during the 12 months. The use of services in the health care sector was similar across both time points and groups (difference: psychiatric hospitalization <5 and <5; general practice -1.32; SE 3.68 and 2.02; SE 3.19). Overall, the patients showed high acceptability and considered the app as being easy to use. Therapists worried about potential negative influences on the therapist-patient interaction from new work tasks accompanying the introduction of the new technology but pointed at innovation potential from digital database registrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests both positive and negative consequences of mobile diary apps as adjuncts to DBT compared with paper diary cards.

However, the mechanisms by which dCBT-I reduces and prevents depression is less clear. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms: dCBT-I (N=358), or online sleep education as the control condition (N=300). Outcome variables were measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year follow-up, and included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16), and the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ). The analyses tested change in PTQ scores as a mediator for post-treatment insomnia, post-treatment depression, and incident depression at one-year follow-up. Results Reductions in rumination (PTQ) were significantly larger in the dCBT-I condition compared to control. Results also showed that reductions in rumination significantly mediated the improvement in post-treatment insomnia severity (proportional effect = 11%) and post-treatment depression severity (proportional effect = 19%) associated with the dCBT-I condition. Finally, reductions in rumination also significantly mediated the prevention of clinically significant depression via dCBT-I (proportional effect = 42%). Limitations Depression was measured with a validated self-report instrument instead of clinical interviews. Durability of results beyond one-year follow-up should also be tested in future research. Conclusions Results provide evidence that rumination is an important mechanism in how dCBT-I reduces and prevents depression."

Although several reviews and meta-analyses indicated feasibility and efficacy for adults with depression and anxiety, digital treatments are poorly accessed and disseminated. This review illustrates potentials and limitations of interventions that specifically leveraged unique features of digital technology and were grounded in the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). METHODS: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic database search was conducted in October 2021. Peer-reviewed, English-language studies were included if i) they reported data from RCTs for adults aged 18+ who engaged with CBT-informed digital interventions targeting primarily depression and anxiety; ii) they used at least PHQ-9 or GAD-7 as standardized and validated assessment self-report measures for depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Findings from 35 RCTs examining 33 interventions (25 internet-based, 6 mobile-based, a2 mobile/web) are discussed. The quality of the evidence differed widely as many small-scale RCTs reported only short-term feasibility and preliminary efficacy. Effects of CBT-informed digital interventions were substantially larger when compared to waitlist than active control conditions. Greater therapeutic benefits were observed for interventions that offered clinical assistance or were used in combination with other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: CBT-informed digital interventions have accumulated enough scientific evidence to be positioned today as: i) a low-intensity tool for those with subclinical levels of symptoms; ii) a first step in a stepped-care approach to service delivery iii) a low-cost, easily accessible option for targeted preventive programs."

This review synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital CBT on psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). An extensive search was conducted in 10 databases from inception until August 29, 2021. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed using Hedges' g. The potential sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis. A total of 18 RCTs in 2514 perinatal women were identified from over 23 countries. The sample size ranged from 25 to 910. Meta-analyses showed that digital CBT significantly reduced depression (g = -0.56, 95% CI: -0.85, -0.27, I2 = 84.81%, p < 0.001), anxiety (g = -0.30, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.17, I2 = 0%, p < 0.001), and stress (g = -0.75, 95% CI: -0.95, -0.56, I2 = 0%, p < 0.001) symptoms at post-intervention and stress symptoms at follow-up (g = -0.52, 95% CI: -0.93, -0.11, I2 = 0%, p = 0.01) compared with those in the control group. Subgroup analyses highlighted that the intervention was effective when CBT was combined with other therapeutic components which delivered via a mobile application. Preferable features of intervention should be more than eight sessions and conducted for than 6 weeks among postnatal women. Multivariable meta-regression showed that age was a significant covariate on depression symptoms. The sample size in the selected RCTs was small, and the overall quality of the evidence was very low. Digital CBT is a potential intervention for alleviating psychological outcomes in perinatal women. This review suggests the essential features to optimize the intervention effect. Further well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are necessary."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a usability evaluation of a personalized, self-guided, app-based intervention for depression. METHODS: Participants were administered the System Usability Scale and open-ended questions as part of a semistructured interview. There were 15 participants equally divided into 3 groups: (1) individuals with clinical depression who were the target audience for the app, (2) mental health professionals, and (3) researchers who specialize in the area of eHealth interventions and/or depression research. RESULTS: The end-user group rated the app highly, both in quantitative and qualitative assessments. The 2 expert groups highlighted the self-monitoring features and range of established psychological treatment options (such as behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring) but had concerns that the amount and layout of content may be difficult for end users to navigate in a self-directed fashion. The end-user data did not confirm these concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging participant engagement via self-monitoring and feedback, as well as personalized messaging, may be a viable way to maintain participation in self-guided interventions. Further evaluation is necessary to determine whether levels of engagement with these features enhance treatment effects."

While all individuals are at risk, certain career fields such as military service are at an elevated risk. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is highly effective at treating mental health disorders but suffers from low compliance and high dropout rates in military environments. The current study conducted a randomized controlled trial with military personnel to assess outcomes for an asymptomatic group (n = 10) not receiving mental health treatment, a symptomatic group (n = 10) using a mHealth application capable of monitoring physiological stress via a commercial wearable alerting users to the presence of stress, guiding them through stress reduction techniques, and communicating information to providers, and a symptomatic control group (n = 10) of military personnel undergoing CBT. Fifty percent of symptomatic controls dropped out of CBT early and the group maintained baseline symptoms. In contrast, those who used the mHealth application completed therapy and showed a significant reduction in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and anger. The results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of pairing data-driven mobile applications with CBT in vulnerable populations, leading to an improvement in therapy compliance and a reduction in symptoms compared to CBT treatment alone. Future work is focused on the inclusion of passive sensing modalities and the integration of additional data sources to provide better insights and inform clinical decisions to improve personalized support."

Digital interventions are increasingly available in the workplace context, but supporting evidence is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of 3 digital interventions for depressive symptoms in a sample of UK-based working adults experiencing mild to moderate symptoms. METHODS: This was a parallel, multiarm, pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 digital interventions or a waitlist control group and had 3 weeks to complete 6 to 8 short self-guided sessions. The 3 interventions are available on the Unmind mental health app for working adults and draw on behavioral activation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Web-based assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention (week 3), and at 1-month follow-up (week 7). Participants were recruited via Prolific, a web-based recruitment platform, and the study was conducted entirely on the web. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed using objective engagement data and self-reported feedback. Efficacy outcomes were assessed using validated self-report measures of mental health and functioning and linear mixed models with intention-to-treat principles. RESULTS: In total, 2003 individuals were screened for participation, of which 20.22% (405/2003) were randomized. A total of 92% (373/405) of the participants were retained in the study, 97.4% (295/303) initiated their allocated intervention, and 66.3% (201/303) completed all sessions. Moreover, 80.6% (229/284) of the participants rated the quality of their allocated intervention as excellent or good, and 79.6% (226/284) of the participants were satisfied or very satisfied with their intervention. All active groups showed improvements in well-being, functioning, and depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with the control group, which were maintained at 4 weeks. Hedges g effect sizes for depressive symptoms ranged from -0.53 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.81) to -0.74 (95% CI -0.45 to -1.03). CONCLUSIONS: All interventions were feasible and acceptable, and the preliminary efficacy findings indicated that their use may improve depressive symptoms, well-being, and functioning. The predefined criteria for a definitive trial were met.

10.2196/21304,Digital Cognitive Behavior Therapy Intervention for Depression and Anxiety: Retrospective Study,"Venkatesan A, Rahimi L, Kaur M, Mosunic C.",JMIR Ment Health,2020,2020.8.27,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions offer a scalable solution that reduces barriers to seeking care for clinical depression and anxiety. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week therapist supported, app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety within 9 months. METHODS: A total of 323 participants with mild to moderately severe depression or anxiety were enrolled in a 12-week digital cognitive behavior therapy program. The analysis was restricted to participants who provided at least one follow-up assessment after baseline. As a result, 146 participants (45.2%) were included in the analysis-74 (50.7%) participants completed assessments at 3 months, 31 participants (21.2%) completed assessments at 6 months, and 21 participants (14.4%) completed assessments at 9 months. The program included structured lessons and tools (ie, exercises and practices) as well as one-on-one weekly video counseling sessions with a licensed therapist for 12 weeks and monthly check-in sessions for 1 year. The clinically validated Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Linear mixed-effects modeling was employed to examine changes in depression and anxiety over time. RESULTS: We observed a significant positive effect of program time on improvement in depression (β=-0.12, P<.001) and anxiety scores (β=-0.10, P<.001). At the end of the 12-week intervention, we observed an average reduction of 3.76 points (95% CI -4.76 to -2.76) in PHQ-8 scores. Further reductions in depression were seen at program month 6 (4.75-point reduction, 95% CI -6.61 to -2.88) and program month 9 (6.42-point reduction, 95% CI -8.66 to -6.55, P<.001). A similar pattern of improvement emerged for anxiety, with a 3.17-point reduction at the end of the 12-week intervention (95% CI -4.21 to -2.13). These improvements were maintained at program month 6 (4.87-point reduction, 95% CI -6.85 to -2.87) and program month 9 (5.19-point, 95% -6.85 to 4.81). In addition, greater program engagement during the first 12 weeks predicted a greater reduction in depression (β=-0.29, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that digital interventions can support sustained and clinically meaningful improvements in depression and anxiety. Furthermore, it appears that strong initial digital mental health intervention engagement may facilitate this effect. However, the study was limited by postintervention participant attrition as well as the retrospective observational study design."

BACKGROUND: Technology-enabled services (TES; clinical services that include both technology-driven [e.g., personal sensing technologies] and person-powered support elements) may address gaps in depression and anxiety treatments in healthcare settings. The current study: (1) developed a TES tailored for Primary Care patients with depression and/or anxiety, and (2) conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of the TES compared to a digital psychoeducation control app. METHODS: Participants were randomized to either: (1) TES: the ""Vira"" smartphone app (Ksana Health Inc.), informed by behavioral activation and using passive sensing technology to provide behavioral ""insights"" and target behaviors associated with mental health symptoms, alongside lay-provider coaching, or (2) Control: the Mood Education mobile app (ME), containing static psychoeducational resources designed to target mental health symptoms. Both apps collected usage data. Participants completed assessments on depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), health-related quality of life (PedsQL), and engagement (TWEETs) at baseline, mid-treatment (week 4), end-of-treatment (week 8), and post-treatment (week 12). RESULTS: Participants (N = 130) were randomized to receive either the TES (Vira; Mage= 30) or ME (Mage= 33). Linear mixed-effects models determined significant improvements in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores for participants across both conditions (ps < 0.001). There was no interactive effect of intervention and time for the PHQ-9 (p = .90) nor the GAD-7 (p = .49). Adjusting for baseline differences and randomization strata, TES participants reported a greater change in a quality of life rating of Physical Functioning (PedsQL) across time (p = .018). TES participants also reported higher levels of engagement and demonstrated higher app usage. However, adjusting for baseline symptom severity, neither app usage nor coach interaction frequency moderated outcomes (ps ≥ 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: While the TES demonstrated superior engagement, improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms for both conditions speak to the potential benefit of both TES and low-intensity psychoeducation treatments in care settings. Future research is needed to better understand which patients might differentially benefit from TESs and broader personal sensing technologies over low-intensity treatments.

10.1111/camh.12627,Development of a chatbot for depression: adolescent perceptions and recommendations,"Dosovitsky G, Bunge E.",Child Adolesc Ment Health,2023,2022.12.12,,,"BACKGROUND: Chatbots are a relatively new technology that has shown promising outcomes for mental health symptoms in adults; however, few studies have been done with adolescents or reported adolescent user experiences and recommendations for chatbot development. METHODS: Twenty three participants ages 13-18 (Mage  = 14.96) engaged in user testing of a chatbot developed to psychoeducate adolescents on depression, teach behavioral activation, and change negative thoughts. Thematic analysis was conducted of participants' responses to user experience questions, impressions, and recommendations. RESULTS: Over half (56.5%) of the sample completed the full intervention and provided user experience feedback online. The average NPS score was 6.04 (SD = 2.18), and 64.3% (n = 9) said they would use the chatbot in the future. Of all user experience responses, 54.5% were positive. The most common impressions were related to symptom improvement (61.1%) and availability (52.8%) The most frequent recommendations were related to solving technical problems (66%). CONCLUSIONS: Chatbots for mental health are acceptable to some adolescents, a population that tends to be reluctant to engage with traditional mental health services. Most participants reported positive experiences with the chatbot, believing that it could help with symptom improvement and is highly available. Adolescents highlighted some technical and stylistic problems that developers should consider. More pilot and user testing is needed to develop mental health chatbots that are appealing and relevant to adolescents."

Due to technological advancements, individually tailored therapy and online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are on the rise. OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the efficacy of a smartphone app based on third-wave CBT tailored to an individual. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 126 participants who were divided into 2 groups. The intervention group used the smartphone app BetterLife for 10 weeks, while the control group was placed on a waiting list for the same duration. The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS), Korean Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES), World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered at baseline and after 10 weeks to both groups. RESULTS: Of the 126 participants, 11 dropped out during the trial. A 2-way repeated measure analysis of covariance was conducted, controlling for baseline BDI. There were greater improvements in PSS (F=24.33, P<.001, η2=0.17) and UWESK scores (F=8.32, P=.0046, η2=0.06) in the intervention group than in the control group. WHOQOL scores exhibited statistically significant improvement in the intervention group in the overall quality of life (F=8.19, P=.0049, η2=0.06), physical health (F=8.87, P=.003, η2=0.07), psychological health (F=13.32, P<.001, η2=0.10), social relationships (F=19.43, P<.001, η2=0.14), and environmental domains (F=10.14, P=.002, η2=0.08) but not overall health (F=1.68, P=.20). BDI (F=7.17, P=.008, η2=0.06) and BAI (F=6.00, P=.02, η2=0.05) showed a statistically significant improvement in the intervention group, but this significance did not survive the Bonferroni correction (P<.005).

App): Development, Feasibility, and Acceptance Study","Dietvorst E, Aukes MA, Legerstee JS, Vreeker A, Hrehovcsik MM, Keijsers L, Hillegers MHJ.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.3.3,,,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and mood problems in adolescents often go unnoticed and may therefore remain untreated. Identifying and preventing the development of emotional problems requires monitoring and effective tools to strengthen adolescents' resilience, for example, by enhancing coping skills. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the developmental process, feasibility, and acceptance of Grow It!, a multiplayer serious game app for adolescents aged 12-25 years. The app consists of the experience sampling method (ESM) to monitor thoughts, behaviors, and emotions in daily life to enhance self-insight and daily cognitive behavioral therapy-based challenges to promote adaptive coping. METHODS: Our approach entails an iterative game design process combined with an agile method to develop the smartphone app. The incorporated game features (ie, challenges, chat functionality, and visual representation) in the Grow It! app were co-designed with adolescent end users to increase participant engagement and adherence. RESULTS: The Grow It! app was delivered for Android and iOS in May 2020. Grow It! was offered to adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis between May and December 2020. Participants of the Grow It! COVID-19 study (sample 1: N=685; mean age 16.19, SD 3.11 years; 193/685, 28.2% boys; sample 2: N=1035; mean age 18.78, SD 3.51 years; 193/1035, 18.64% boys) completed 31.5% (13.2/42) to 49.5% (10.4/21) of challenges. Compliance of ESM was suboptimal (35.1/210, 16.7% to 32.5/105, 30.9%). Follow-up questionnaires indicated an overall score of the app of 7.1 out of 10. Moreover, 72.6% (278/383) to 75.6% (487/644) would recommend the app to friends. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, Grow It! is the first gamified ESM app that both measures individual differences in emotional dynamics and offers an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention. Our findings support the feasibility and acceptance, and therefore applicability, of the Grow It! app in adolescents. Further iterations of this serious game app will focus on the increase of compliance and on providing participants feedback through their personal mood profiles."

Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), post-treatment (T2, week 8), and follow-up (T3, 2-month postnatal follow-up) by blinded interviewers. The primary outcome was depression measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at T2. We also assessed anxiety, stress, sleep quality, well-being, physical activity, treatment response, and offspring child behavior problems. RESULTS: Eighty-one participants were randomized to the intervention (n=37) or active control (n=44) groups. Seventy-one participants completed the post-treatment assessment or reported primary outcome data. No differences were found between the intervention and active control groups regarding maternal depression or other mental health outcomes. Overall, we found large within-group effect sizes, with 80% of the total sample responding to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference between the groups, suggesting that adding apps to psychotherapy treatment may not enhance treatment effects on prenatal depression. A within-groups analysis showed that most participants with depression responded to treatment; however, future studies are needed to confirm whether this effect is related to factors other than the intervention."
10.2196/54912,Behavioral Activation Mobile App to Motivate Smokers to Quit: Feasibility and Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Borrelli B, Bartlett YK, Fulford D, Frasco G, Armitage CJ, Wearden A.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.4.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) is an evidence-based treatment for depression that fosters engagement in values-based activities to increase access to positive reinforcement. Depressed mood has been shown to hinder smoking cessation. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mobile app to motivate smokers to quit by using BA and integrating motivational messages to quit smoking. METHODS: Adult smokers (N=56; mean age 34.5, SD 9.52 years) who were not ready to quit smoking within 30 days were recruited from advertisements and randomized to either 8 weeks of the BA app (set 2 values-based activities per week+motivational messages+feedback on changes in smoking, mood, and values-based activities) or the control group (no app; received resources for quitting smoking). All participants completed the baseline and end-of-treatment web-based questionnaires. Controls also completed weekly web-based assessments, and BA app participants completed assessments through the app. RESULTS: There were no dropouts and only 2 participants in each condition did not complete the end-of-treatment questionnaire. The results demonstrated that it is feasible to recruit smokers who are unmotivated to quit into a smoking cessation induction trial: 86% (57/66) of eligible participants were randomized (BA app: n=27; control: n=29). Participants reported high levels of satisfaction: 80% (20/25) of participants said they would recommend the BA app, there were moderate-to-high scores on the Mobile App Rating Scale, and 88% (22/25) of participants rated the app 3 stars or higher (out of 5). There were high levels of BA app engagement: 96% (26/27) of participants planned activities, and 67% (18/27) of participants planned 7 or more activities. High engagement was found even among those who were at the highest risk for continued smoking (low motivation to quit, low confidence to quit, and high negative affect). The results provided support for the hypothesized relationships between BA constructs: greater pleasant activity completion was associated with greater positive affect (b=0.37, SE 0.21; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.79; P=.08), and greater positive affect tended to predict fewer cigarettes smoked the next day (b=-0.19, SE 0.10; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.01; P=.06). Additionally, a greater number of activities planned was associated with lower negative affect (b=-0.26, SE 0.15; 95% CI -0.55 to 0.04; P=.09). Overall, 16% (4/25) of BA app participants set a quit date versus 4% (1/27) among controls, and there were promising (but not significant) trends for motivation and confidence to quit. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a mobile app intervention can be made appealing to smokers who are unmotivated to quit by focusing on aspects most important to them, such as mood management. This theory-based intervention has shown some initial support for the underlying theoretical constructs, and further efficacy testing is warranted in a fully powered trial."

Patients with depression often do not receive adequate treatment. App-based psychotherapy is considered to have great potential to treat depression owing to its reach and easy accessibility. OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the impact of app-based psychological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 23, 2020. We selected randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of app-based psychological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized studies and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies) were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Where possible, we pooled data using random effects meta-analyses to obtain estimates of the effect size of the intervention. We conducted post hoc meta-regression analyses to explore the factors associated with intervention success. RESULTS: After screening 3468 unique references retrieved from bibliographic searches and assessing the eligibility of 79 full texts, we identified 12 trials (2859 participants) evaluating 14 different interventions. Of 14 trials, 7 (58%) were conducted in the United States; 3 (25%) trials, in Asia (Japan, South Korea, and China); 1 (8%) trial, in Australia; and 1 (8%) trial, in Germany. Of the 12 trials, 5 (42%) trials presented a low risk of bias. The mean duration of the interventions was 6.6 (SD 2.8) weeks. Two-thirds of the interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy alone or included it in combination with cognitive control therapy, positive psychology, brief behavioral activation, or mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapy. With no evidence of publication bias, a pooled analysis of 83% (10/12) of the trials and 86% (12/14) of the interventions showed that app-based interventions, compared with a control group receiving usual care or minimal intervention, produced a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.51, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.33; 2018/2859, 70.58% of the participants; I2=70%). Our meta-regression analyses indicated that there was a greater reduction in symptoms of depression (P=.04) in trials that included participants with moderate to severe depression (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.55), compared with trials with participants exhibiting mild to moderate depression (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.12). CONCLUSIONS: App-based interventions targeted at people with depression produce moderate reductions in the symptoms of depression. More methodologically robust trials are needed to confirm our findings, determine which intervention features are associated with greater improvements, and identify those populations most likely to benefit from this type of intervention.

10.2196/mhealth.5960,Mobile Sensing and Support for People With Depression: A Pilot Trial in the Wild,"Wahle F, Kowatsch T, Fleisch E, Rufer M, Weidt S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2016,2016.9.23,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. METHODS: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. RESULTS: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for ≥2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9≥11) at baseline and adherence ≥8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=-.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9≥11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1% and 59.1% accuracy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states."
10.1111/dme.14948,The effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy and third-wave cognitive behavioural interventions on diabetes-related distress: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Jenkinson E, Knoop I, Hudson JL, Moss-Morris R, Hackett RA.",Diabet Med,2022,2022.8.29,,,"AIM: Diabetes-related distress is common in diabetes and has implications for well-being. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and third-wave CBT hold promise as treatments for diabetes-related distress, although previous findings are inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to understand the efficacy of these interventions in treating diabetes-related distress, while also assessing the associative benefits of these interventions on depression, anxiety and glycaemic control. We also aimed to conduct a narrative synthesis, and subgroup analyses to identify intervention components most useful in treating diabetes-related distress. METHOD: We searched seven electronic databases from inception to April 2021. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed. The protocol was registered with the Prospective Register Of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42021240628. RESULTS: We included 22 randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of CBT and third-wave CBT interventions on diabetes-related distress. CBT for diabetes-related distress significantly reduced distress (SMD = -0.278, p = 0.010) and depression (SMD = -0.604, p = 0.016). Third-wave CBT for diabetes-related distress significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.451, p = 0.034). No significant effect of either intervention on glycated haemoglobin was observed. CBT interventions that included a digital component, were delivered by a psychological practitioner, and included behavioural activation bolstered the effects on diabetes-related distress. CONCLUSIONS: CBT aiming to target diabetes-related distress is beneficial for distress and depression. Third-wave CBT for diabetes-related distress is beneficial for anxiety. More work is needed to optimise interventions to improve both mental and physical health outcomes in people with diabetes."

At least half of the people affected by depression remain untreated. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, access to mental health specialists, habitually challenging, has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet-based CBT is an effective and feasible strategy to increase access to treatment for people with depression. Mental health apps may further assist in facilitating self-management for people affected by depression; however, accessing the correct app may be cumbersome given the large number and wide variety of apps offered by public app marketplaces. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically assess the features, functionality, data security, and congruence with evidence of self-guided CBT-based apps targeting users affected by depression that are available in major app stores. METHODS: We conducted a systematic assessment of self-guided CBT-based apps available in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Apps launched or updated since August 2018 were identified through a systematic search in the 42matters database using CBT-related terms. Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were downloaded and assessed using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (Android 9) and iPhone 7 (iOS 13.3.1). Apps were appraised using a 182-question checklist developed by the research team, assessing their general characteristics, technical aspects and quality assurance, and CBT-related features, including 6 evidence-based CBT techniques (ie, psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation, and exposure for comorbid anxiety) as informed by a CBT manual, CBT competence framework, and a literature review of internet-based CBT clinical trial protocols. The results were reported as a narrative review using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 3006 apps, of which 98 met the inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 well-being apps; 65 mental health apps, targeting two or more common mental health disorders, including depression; and 13 depression apps. A total of 28 apps offered at least four evidence-based CBT techniques, particularly depression apps. Cognitive restructuring was the most common technique, offered by 79% (77/98) of the apps. Only one-third of the apps offered suicide risk management resources, whereas 17% (17/98) of the apps offered COVID-19-related information. Although most apps included a privacy policy, only a third of the apps presented it before account creation. In total, 82% (74/90) of privacy policies stated sharing data with third-party service providers. Half of the app development teams included academic institutions or health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Only a few self-guided CBT-based apps offer comprehensive CBT programs or suicide risk management resources. Sharing of users' data is widespread, highlighting shortcomings in health app market governance. To fulfill their potential, self-guided CBT-based apps should follow evidence-based clinical guidelines, be patient centered, and enhance users' data security."
10.2196/38162,Digital Screening and Automated Resource Identification System to Address COVID-19-Related Behavioral Health Disparities: Feasibility Study,"Stiles-Shields C, Batts KR, Reyes KM, Archer J, Crosby S, Draxler JM, Lennan N, Held P.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.6.13,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health (DMH) tools use technology (eg, websites and mobile apps) to conveniently deliver mental health resources to users in real time, reducing access barriers. Underserved communities facing health care provider shortages and limited mental health resources may benefit from DMH tools, as these tools can help improve access to resources. OBJECTIVE: This study described the development and feasibility evaluation of the Emotional Needs Evaluation and Resource Guide for You (ENERGY) System, a DMH tool to meet the mental health and resource needs of youth and their families developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ENERGY System offers a brief assessment of resource needs; problem-solving capabilities; and symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma, and alcohol and substance use followed by automated, personalized feedback based on the participant's responses. METHODS: Individuals aged ≥15 years were recruited through community partners, community events, targeted electronic health record messages, and social media. Participants completed screening questions to establish eligibility, entered demographic information, and completed the ENERGY System assessment. Based on the participant's responses, the ENERGY System immediately delivered digital resources tailored to their identified areas of need (eg, relaxation). A subset of participants also voluntarily completed the following: COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) or COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA); resource needs assessment; and feedback on their experience using the ENERGY System. If resource needs (eg, housing and food insecurity) were endorsed, lists of local resources were provided. RESULTS: A total of 212 individuals accessed the ENERGY System link, of which 96 (45.3%) completed the screening tool and 86 (40.6%) received resources. Participant responses on the mental health screening questions triggered on average 2.04 (SD 1.94) intervention domains. Behavioral Activation/Increasing Activities was the most frequently launched intervention domain (56%, 54/96), and domains related to alcohol or substance use were the least frequent (4%, 4/96). The most frequently requested support areas were finances (33%, 32/96), transportation (26%, 25/96), and food (24%, 23/96). The CEFIS and CEFIS-AYA indicated higher than average impacts from the pandemic (ie, average scores >2.5). Participants were satisfied with the ENERGY System overall (65%, 39/60) as well as the length of time it took to answer the questions (90%, 54/60), which they found easy to answer (87%, 52/60). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided initial support for the feasibility of the ENERGY System, a DMH tool capable of screening for resource and mental health needs and providing automated, personalized, and free resources and techniques to meet the identified needs. Future studies should seek direct feedback from community members to further improve the ENERGY System and its dissemination to encourage use."

However, few studies have examined which aspects of BA are most contributory to its efficacy. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a 9-week randomized controlled trial of smartphone CBT for patients with major depression. Depression severity was measured at baseline and at end of treatment by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. All aspects of behavioral activation tasks that the participants had engaged in, including their expected mastery and pleasure and obtained mastery and pleasure, were recorded in the web server. We examined their contribution to improvement in depression as simple correlations and in stepwise multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 78 patients who completed at least one behavioral experiment, all aspects of expected or achieved mastery or pleasure correlated with change in depression severity. Discrepancy between the expectation and achievement, representing unexpected gain in mastery or pleasure, was not correlated. In stepwise regression, expected mastery and pleasure, especially the maximum level of the latter, emerged as the strongest contributing factors. LIMITATIONS: The study is observational and cannot deduce cause-effect relationships. CONCLUSIONS: It may be the expected and continued sense of pleasure in planning activities that are most meaningful and rewarding to individuals, and not the simple level or amount of obtained pleasure, that contributes to the efficacy of BA."
10.31662/jmaj.2022-0225,Toward the Goal of Leaving No One Behind: Orthostatic Dysregulation,"Shinno K, Nagamitsu S.",JMA J,2023,2023.8.10,,,"Orthostatic dysregulation (OD), a common psychosomatic disorder in children, is caused by circulation disturbance resulting from autonomic imbalance. OD is a significant public health threat due to its association with school refusal and depression in children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children suffered from school closures, lack of exercise, smartphone addiction, and school refusal. The COVID-19 pandemic made it much more difficult to deliver existing approaches to patients and families with OD and increased the risk of prolonged and severe OD. In response, web-based digital health solutions are expected to support patients and families. Digital therapeutics for OD can not only deliver established treatments online, such as pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy but also provide new interventions, such as regular mental health programs led by clinical psychologists. It is necessary to keep in mind that digital therapeutics are not intended to replace established treatments, but rather to supplement them and provide additional support. However, most research on OD has been conducted in Japan. Therefore, to provide unique findings from Japan, it is important to conduct further epidemiological research using large-scale databases in the real world and reveal the clinical characteristics and detailed epidemiology of OD, leading to the development of novel treatments."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore potential reasons for mixed findings in the literature on integrated digital treatments. We described the methodologies and core characteristics of these interventions, identified the presence of evidence-based treatment strategies, examined patterns across digital modalities, and highlighted areas of overlap as well as critical gaps in the existing evidence base. METHODS: In June 2024, a literature search was conducted in Google Scholar to identify digital integrated interventions for comorbid major depressive disorder and substance use disorder. Articles were included if they described interventions targeting both conditions simultaneously; were grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, or motivational enhancement therapy; and were delivered at least in part via digital modalities. In total, 14 studies meeting these criteria were coded using an open-coding approach to identify intervention characteristics and treatment strategies (n=25). Statistical analyses summarized descriptive statistics to capture the frequency and overlap of these strategies. RESULTS: Studies included a range of digital modalities: internet (n=6, 43%), computer (n=3, 21%), smartphone (n=2, 14%), and supportive text messaging interventions (n=3, 21%). Half (n=7, 50%) of the studies included participants with mild to moderate depression symptom severity and hazardous substance use. Only 36% (n=5) of the studies required participants to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder for inclusion and 21% (n=3) required a substance use disorder diagnosis. Most interventions targeted adults (n=11, 79%), with few targeting young or emerging adults (n=4, 29%), and only 36% (n=5) reported detailed demographic data. Treatment duration averaged 10.3 (SD 6.8) weeks. Internet-based interventions offered the widest range of treatment strategies (mean 11.7), while supportive text messaging used the fewest (mean 4.6). Common treatment strategies included self-monitoring (n=11, 79%), psychoeducation (n=10, 71%), and coping skills (n=9, 64%). Interventions often combined therapeutic strategies, with psychoeducation frequently paired with self-monitoring (n=9, 64%), assessment (n=7, 50%), coping skills (n=7, 50%), decisional balance (n=7, 50%), feedback (n=7, 50%), and goal setting (n=7, 50%). CONCLUSIONS: Among integrated digital interventions for comorbid depression and substance use, there was noteworthy variability in methodology, inclusion criteria, digital modalities, and embedded treatment strategies. Without standardized methods, comparison of the clinical outcomes across studies is challenging. These results emphasize the critical need for future research to adopt standardized approaches to facilitate more accurate comparisons and a clearer understanding of intervention efficacy."
10.2196/39799,Effect of Mobile Phone App-Based Interventions on Quality of Life and Psychological Symptoms Among Adult Cancer Survivors: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Qin M, Chen B, Sun S, Liu X.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.12.19,,,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with cancer experience psychological or physical distress, which can adversely affect their quality of life (QOL). Smartphone app interventions are increasingly being used to improve QOL and psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of this type of intervention, with conflicting results in the literature. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the effectiveness of mobile phone app interventions on QOL and psychological outcomes in adult patients with cancer, with a special focus on intervention duration, type of cancer, intervention theory, treatment strategy, and intervention delivery format. METHODS: We conducted a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang to identify studies involving apps that focused on cancer survivors and QOL or psychological symptoms published from inception to October 30, 2022. We selected only randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria and performed systematic review and meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI was pooled when needed. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: In total, 30 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5353 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with routine care, app interventions might improve QOL (SMD=0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.51; P<.001); enhance self-efficacy (SMD=0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.29; P=.03); and alleviate anxiety (SMD=-0.64, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.56; P<.001), depression (SMD=-0.33, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.08; P=.009), and distress (SMD=-0.34, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.08; P=.01). Short-term (duration of ≤3 months), physician-patient interaction (2-way communication using a smartphone app), and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions might be the most effective for improving QOL and alleviating adverse psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that interventions using mobile health apps might improve QOL and self-efficacy as well as alleviate anxiety, depression, and distress in adult cancer survivors. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and the study design. More rigorous trials are warranted to confirm the suitable duration and validate the different intervention theories as well as address methodological flaws in previous studies.

10.2196/27388,Characteristics of Mobile Health Platforms for Depression and Anxiety: Content Analysis Through a Systematic Review of the Literature and Systematic Search of Two App Stores,"Leong QY, Sridhar S, Blasiak A, Tadeo X, Yeo G, Remus A, Ho D.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.2.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) platforms show promise in the management of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. This has resulted in an abundance of mHealth platforms available for research or commercial use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to characterize the current state of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression that are available for research, commercial use, or both. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using a two-pronged approach: searching relevant literature with prespecified search terms to identify platforms in published research and simultaneously searching 2 major app stores-Google Play Store and Apple App Store-to identify commercially available platforms. Key characteristics of the mHealth platforms were synthesized, such as platform name, targeted condition, targeted group, purpose, technology type, intervention type, commercial availability, and regulatory information. RESULTS: The literature and app store searches yielded 169 and 179 mHealth platforms, respectively. Most platforms developed for research purposes were designed for depression (116/169, 68.6%), whereas the app store search reported a higher number of platforms developed for anxiety (Android: 58/179, 32.4%; iOS: 27/179, 15.1%). The most common purpose of platforms in both searches was treatment (literature search: 122/169, 72.2%; app store search: 129/179, 72.1%). With regard to the types of intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy and referral to care or counseling emerged as the most popular options offered by the platforms identified in the literature and app store searches, respectively. Most platforms from both searches did not have a specific target age group. In addition, most platforms found in app stores lacked clinical and real-world evidence, and a small number of platforms found in the published research were available commercially. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression are available for research, commercial use, or both. The characteristics of these mHealth platforms greatly vary. Future efforts should focus on assessing the quality-utility, safety, and effectiveness-of the existing platforms and providing developers, from both commercial and research sectors, a reporting guideline for their platform description and a regulatory framework to facilitate the development, validation, and deployment of effective mHealth platforms."
10.2196/54252,Examining a Fully Automated Mobile-Based Behavioral Activation Intervention in Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Santopetro N, Jones D, Garron A, Meyer A, Joyner K, Hajcak G.",JMIR Ment Health,2024,2024.8.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress in our understanding of depression, prevalence rates have substantially increased in recent years. Thus, there is an imperative need for more cost-effective and scalable mental health treatment options, including digital interventions that minimize therapist burden. OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on a fully automated digital implementation of behavioral activation (BA)-a core behavioral component of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. We examine the efficacy of a 1-month fully automated SMS text message-based BA intervention for reducing depressive symptoms and anhedonia. METHODS: To this end, adults reporting at least moderate current depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10) were recruited online across the United States and randomized to one of three conditions: enjoyable activities (ie, BA), healthy activities (ie, an active control condition), and passive control (ie, no contact). Participants randomized to enjoyable and healthy activities received daily SMS text messages prompting them to complete 2 activities per day; participants also provided a daily report on the number and enjoyment of activities completed the prior day. RESULTS: A total of 126 adults (mean age 32.46, SD 7.41 years) with current moderate depressive symptoms (mean score 16.53, SD 3.90) were recruited. Participants in the enjoyable activities condition (BA; n=39) experienced significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms compared to participants in the passive condition (n=46). Participants in both active conditions-enjoyable activities and healthy activities (n=41)-reported reduced symptoms of anxiety compared to those in the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence regarding the efficacy of a fully automated digital BA intervention for depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, reminders to complete healthy activities may be a promising intervention for reducing anxiety symptoms."

An updated systematic review and meta-analysis,"Tindall L, Kerrigan P, Li J, Hayward E, Gega L.",Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,2024,2024.4.14,,,"Behavioural Activation (BA)-a brief therapy based on the scheduling of enjoyable, purposeful and rewarding activities-is an effective and cost-effective treatment for depression in adults that shows promise for children and adolescents. We provide an update on a previous systematic review of evidence on BA-delivered in-person, telephone, or online-for depression and comorbid anxiety in children and adolescents. We conducted systematic literature searches in 6 databases up to February 2024. We included all study designs evaluating BA with participants up to 18 years old with diagnosable depression, as established by a validated screening tool or diagnostic manual. We used the Moncrieff Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess study quality. We summarised the findings of all study types with a narrative synthesis and of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a meta-analysis. Overall, 24 studies (6 RCTs, 18 pre-post evaluations, n = 2,758) met our inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (n = 156) showed that BA has a small effect of 0.24 (Hedge's adjusted g) in reducing depression symptoms compared to a waiting-list control, usual care and other therapies. Online and telephone-facilitated BA was shown to be feasible in 3 studies and effective in 1. Outcomes on comorbid anxiety were mixed. No economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. BA shows sufficient promise as an intervention for reducing depression symptoms in children and adolescents to justify the need for further RCTs, providing that five conditions are met: studies are powered to detect a minimal clinically important difference; BA materials are fit-for-purpose to produce clinically meaningful change; follow-ups are longer than 6 months; primary outcomes are child-reported; and intervention costs, resource use and adverse events are reported."

Digital interventions offer a promising avenue for expanding access to evidence-based interventions. METHODS: In a three-arm randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of an app-based intervention and an online group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) to reduce depressive symptoms compared to a waiting list control (WLC). Participants (N=109) with PHQ-9 scores ≥9 were randomized into three groups. Informed consent was obtained. The primary outcome, depressive symptoms, was assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms, loneliness perception, and treatment-related adverse effects. We used one-tailed Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, adjusting p-values for false discovery rate. Statistical significance was set at 5%. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05450614. RESULTS: After excluding dropouts, 58 participants remained (28 app; 19 GCBT; 11 WLC). Most were women (app: 86%; GCBT: 89%; WLC: 100%) and identified as white (app: 61%; GCBT: 63%; WLC: 82%), aged 36 to 39, with high income and education. Only GCBT showed a significant reduction in anxiety (t(23.92) = 2.20, p = 0.019; padj = 0.038; Cohen's d = 0.81, 95% CI [0.17, ∞). The remaining comparisons were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: While only GCBT showed significant improvement in anxiety symptoms, both treatments showed trends toward depressive symptom reduction. High dropout rates and a small sample may have impacted results. Further research should assess the long-term impact and scalability of digital interventions in mental health."
10.1080/03007995.2022.2108616,Network meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of a prescription digital therapeutic for chronic insomnia to medications and face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy in adults,"Forma F, Pratiwadi R, El-Moustaid F, Smith N, Thorndike F, Velez F.",Curr Med Res Opin,2022,2022.8.8,,,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the only Food and Drug Administration-authorized prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) Somryst versus face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), or FDA-approved prescription medications for insomnia. METHODS: A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify relevant studies. A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to examine (1) mean change in insomnia severity index (ISI); (2) proportional change in ISI remitters; (3) mean change in wake after sleep onset (WASO); and (4) mean change in sleep onset latency (SOL). RESULTS: Twenty studies provided data on the PDT, CBT-I, CBT-I in combination with self-help (SH), or two prescription medications (eszopiclone and zolpidem). The PDT was associated with significant mean change in ISI (-5.77, 95% Credible Interval [CrI] - 8.53, -3.07) and ISI remitters (OR 12.33; 95% CrI 2.28, 155.91) compared to placebo, and had the highest probability of being the most effective treatment overall for ISI mean change (56%), and ISI remitters (64%). All evaluated interventions significantly outperformed placebo for WASO but no significant differences were observed for SOL (five interventions). Sensitivity analyses excluding medications and meta-regression (assessing type, duration, delivery method for CBT-I) did not affect NMA results. CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis demonstrated that a PDT delivering CBT-I had the highest probability of being most effective compared to face-to-face CBT-I, prescription sleep medications, or placebo, as measured by reductions in mean ISI score from baseline and ISI-determined remittance. Plain Language Summary: Chronic insomnia is the long-term inability to fall asleep easily or to stay asleep. This condition is much more serious than most people realize, raising the risk of many health problems including depression, heart disease, and injuries.Although sleep medications are commonly used to treat insomnia, these drugs may not be effective and can lead to harms such as accidents or clouded thinking. Clinical guidelines recommend a treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) that is safe and effective. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of clinicians trained to provide CBT-I.Prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) are FDA-approved software programs available on mobile devices such as smartphones. A PDT for insomnia (Somryst) delivers CBT-I and can overcome barriers to access for this important type of therapy. To compare the effectiveness of this PDT with FDA-approved sleep medications and face-to-face CBT-I a special kind of study was conducted called a network meta-analysis. This is a statistical method of combining data from numerous studies in a way that allows the results to be fairly compared.This network meta-analysis of 20 studies found that the PDT was more effective at reducing insomnia symptoms than any of the sleep medications studied and was even more effective than face-to-face CBT-I as measured by scores on a clinically valid scale of insomnia symptoms. These results are encouraging because they suggest that digital delivery of CBT-I could help the millions of people who currently do not have access to this effective treatment."

BACKGROUND: Family members of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome- family (PICS-F), including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line nonpharmacologic treatment for many psychological symptoms and has been successfully delivered by use of mobile technology for symptom self-management. OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy through a smartphone app to family members of critically ill patients. METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study with a consecutive sample of patients admitted to 2 adult ICUs and their family members. The control group period was followed by the intervention group period. The intervention consisted of a mobile health app preloaded on a smartphone provided to family members. The study time points were enrollment (within 5 days of ICU admission), 30 days after admission, and 60 days after admission. Study measures included demographic data, app use, satisfaction with the app, mental health self-efficacy, and measures of PICS-F symptoms. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 49 predominantly White (92%) and female (82%) family members (24 intervention, 25 control). Smartphone ownership was 88%. Completion rates for study measures were 92% in the control group and 79% in the intervention group. Family members logged in to the app a mean of 18.58 times (range 2-89) and spent a mean of 81.29 minutes (range 4.93-426.63 minutes) using the app. CONCLUSIONS: The study results confirm the feasibility of implementing app-based delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to family members of ICU patients."
10.2196/56319,Developing a Guided Web App for Postpartum Depression Symptoms: User-Centered Design Approach,"Franco P, Olhaberry M, Muzard A, Harismendy Á, Kelders S.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.8.19,,,"BACKGROUND: Psychological internet-based interventions have shown promise in preventing and treating perinatal depression, but their effectiveness can be hindered by low user engagement. This challenge often arises from a misalignment between technology attributes, user needs, and context. A user-centered, iterative approach involving all stakeholders is recommended. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aimed to develop a user-friendly psychological internet-based intervention aimed at addressing the symptoms of perinatal depression through an iterative, user-centered approach. METHODS: The development process followed the Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management Roadmap phases of contextual inquiry, value specification, and design. It involved a comprehensive literature review, 2 surveys, 10 focus groups, 5 usability interviews, and 1 technical pilot. RESULTS: The contextual inquiry revealed a demand for accessible interventions for perinatal mental health, with internet-based solutions seen as viable options. Insights from the literature influenced intervention content and features. Stakeholders' openness to the intervention became evident during this phase, along with the integration of the first set of values. Initially, we assessed the broader perinatal context to identify the optimal period for the intervention. On the basis of the findings and practical considerations, we decided to specifically target postpartum depression symptoms. The value specification phase further defined the central values and translated them into requirements. In the design phase, feedback was obtained on the user experience of an early digital prototype and on the prototype's final version. The resulting intervention, named Mamá, te entiendo (""Mom, I get you""), is a guided web app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles, integrating elements from attachment and mentalization theories. It aims to reduce depressive symptoms in women during the first months postpartum and consists of 6 core sequential modules, along with 3 additional modules, including 5 case examples illustrating depressive symptoms and therapeutic techniques. The intervention provides homework exercises and offers users the opportunity to receive feedback from an e-coach through the web app. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of a user-centered and iterative development process for psychological internet-based interventions. This process helps clarify user needs and provides valuable feedback on service design and quality, ultimately having the potential to enhance the utility and, presumably, the effectiveness of the intervention. The Discussion section shares valuable insights from the project, such as the value of the requirement sessions."
10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647606,Effectiveness of Mobile App-Based Psychological Interventions for College Students: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Oliveira C, Pereira A, Vagos P, Nóbrega C, Gonçalves J, Afonso B.",Front Psychol,2021,2021.5.28,,,"Serious mental health disorders are increasing among college students and university counseling services are often overburdened. Mobile applications for mental health have been growing exponentially in the last decade and they are emerging in university settings as a promising tool to promote and intervene in college students' mental health. Additionally, considering the recent covid-19 pandemic, mHealth interventions, due to its nature and possibilities, may play an important role in these institutions. Our main objectives are to explore mhealth interventions in universities, regarding its conceptual framework, acceptability and efficacy outcomes and understand its impact and contributions to address treatment delivery and psychological difficulties resulting from covid-19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in scientific databases, namely, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus. A search in app stores was not conducted, thus regarding commercially available apps, only those found in our database search were included in our review. We selected studies with mobile applications addressing psychological interventions for college students. A total of 2,158 participants were included in the 8 selected studies and most interventions were delivered through mobile apps only and based in cognitive behavioral therapy. Results suggested that college students accept and adhere to these interventions and preliminary evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in different disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression and risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse and sexual knowledge. We conclude that universities, particularly college counseling services, may benefit from mhealth interventions, not only to address college students' mental health but to decrease some of its difficulties related to lack of human resources. Specifically in covid-19 pandemic context, these interventions may contribute significantly by promoting and delivering psychological interventions at a safe distance."

Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet- and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap. OBJECTIVE: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help smartphone app (MCT & More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group (n=200), who received access to the self-help smartphone app MCT & More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list control group (n=200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy. RESULTS: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F1,222=3.98; P=.047; d=0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: F1,220=8.79; P=.003; d=0.40) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet- and mobile-based interventions (r=0.260; P=.004) and the more positive the outcome expectation (r=0.236; P=.009), the more frequently the self-help smartphone app was used. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT & More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low-threshold intervention to enhance students' health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00020941; https://tinyurl.com/pr84w6er."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-isolation, and difficulties linked to online teaching and learning have increased their burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Thus, the urgent need to intervene in favour of these vulnerable subjects, together with the difficulties in delivering in-person interventions because of lockdowns and restrictions, has led to prioritize digital mental health strategies. This study aimed at systematically reviewing the existing literature on digital mental health interventions targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 emergency. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases identified eight randomized controlled trials. Regarding anxiety symptoms, digitally delivered cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and mind-body practice techniques emerged as valid strategies, while digital positive psychology and mindfulness-based interventions showed mixed results. On the other hand, digitally delivered dialectical behaviour therapy and positive psychology interventions have shown some efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms. Overall, the available literature, albeit of low quality, seems to support the role of digital interventions in promoting the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Publisher: Los estudiantes universitarios son particularmente vulnerables a los problemas de salud mental, siendo la ansiedad y la depresión las condiciones más comunes. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, el distanciamiento social, el autoaislamiento y las dificultades relacionadas con la enseñanza y el aprendizaje en línea han aumentado su carga de ansiedad y síntomas depresivos. Así, la urgente necesidad de intervenir a favor de estos sujetos vulnerables, junto con las dificultades para realizar intervenciones presenciales a causa de los confinamientos y restricciones, ha llevado a priorizar estrategias de salud mental digital. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo revisar sistemáticamente la literatura existente sobre intervenciones digitales de salud mental dirigidas a la ansiedad y los síntomas depresivos en estudiantes universitarios durante la emergencia de COVID-19. Las búsquedas sistemáticas en las bases de datos Medline, Embase y PsycInfo identificaron ocho ensayos controlados aleatorios. Con respecto a los síntomas de ansiedad, la terapia cognitiva conductual, la terapia conductual dialéctica y las técnicas de práctica mente-cuerpo entregadas digitalmente surgieron como estrategias válidas, mientras que la psicología positiva digital y las intervenciones basadas en el mindfulness mostraron resultados mixtos. Por otro lado, la terapia conductual dialéctica y las intervenciones de psicología positiva proporcionadas digitalmente han demostrado cierta eficacia en la reducción de los síntomas depresivos. En general, la literatura disponible, aunque de baja calidad, parece respaldar el papel de las intervenciones digitales en la promoción de la salud mental de los estudiantes universitarios durante la pandemia de COVID-19."

Nurses are leaving the profession early in their careers or retiring sooner than expected. Those who remain in the workforce report higher levels of burnout, anxiety, depression, and exhaustion. There is concern that there may be a shortage of at least half a million nurses by 2030. AIMS: This systematic review aimed to investigate the evidence of using a mental health promotion mHealth app to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, Professional Development Collection, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sociological Collection, PsycInfo, Embase, and PubMed with search dates of January 2012-November 15, 2022. The mHealth intervention needed to be asynchronously delivered through a smartphone with hospital nurse participants to be included in this review. RESULTS: Of the 157 articles screened for this review, six were included. Primary outcome variables were anxiety, burnout, coping, depression, self-efficacy, stress, well-being, and work engagement. Intervention types included mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), stress inoculation therapy (SIT), psychoeducation, and stress management. Anxiety, depression, well-being, and burnout improved with MBIs; depression improved with CBT; and anxiety and active coping improved with SIT. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This review demonstrated promising findings in using mHealth apps to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. However, more randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes may reveal which type of mHealth app and how much exposure to the intervention is more effective in improving specific mental health symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up is also recommended to study sustainability of the mental health improvements."
10.2196/16643,A Gamified Smartphone-Based Intervention for Depression: Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Lukas CA, Eskofier B, Berking M.",JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021.7.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Available smartphone-based interventions for depression predominantly use evidence-based strategies from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), but patient engagement and reported effect sizes are small. Recently, studies have demonstrated that smartphone-based interventions combining CBT with gamified approach-avoidance bias modification training (AAMT) can foster patient engagement and reduce symptoms of several mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: Based on these findings, we developed a gamified smartphone-based intervention, mentalis Phoenix (MT-Phoenix), and hypothesized the program would both engage patients and produce preliminary evidence for the reduction of depressive symptoms. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we evaluated MT-Phoenix in a randomized controlled pilot trial including 77 individuals with elevated depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores ≥5). Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured by assessing usage data. The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at postassessment. RESULTS: Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for 46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control condition (F1,74=19.34; P=.001), with a large effect size (d=1.02). Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT with AAMT may foster patient engagement and effectively target depressive symptoms. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 trial using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to active control conditions.

We examined the feasibility and efficacy of a novel smartphone-based fully automated digital CBT intervention, 'Daylight™', to improve symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). METHODS: In this multiple-baseline design, 21 adults (20 F; mean age 43yrs. range 19-65yrs.) with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD were randomized to one of three baseline durations (2-, 4-, or 6-weeks) and then received access to digital CBT. Participants completed daily ratings of anxiety and worry, weekly measures of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep, and measures of anxiety, worry, wellbeing, quality of life, CBT skill acquisition, and work performance at initial assessment prior to baseline randomization, post-intervention, and follow-up. RESULTS: Digital CBT was found to be feasible in terms of engagement, satisfaction, and safety. For preliminary efficacy, improvements were detected in daily and weekly outcomes of anxiety for most participants. Despite individual differences, significant improvements occurred with the introduction of digital CBT and not during baseline. Overall, 70% of participants no longer had clinically significant symptoms of GAD, 61% no longer had significant depressive symptoms, and 40% no longer had significant sleep difficulty at post-intervention. LIMITATIONS: The study sample was recruited using the internet and was mostly female, limiting the generalizability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the feasibility and efficacy of Daylight. Further examination in randomized controlled trials is now warranted."

These compounds, when combined with pharmaceutical drugs, show improved efficacy and safety in preclinical and clinical studies of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, depression, schizophrenia, diabetes and cancer. Their additional clinical benefits include reducing levels of TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines. We describe how pleiotropic natural products can be developed as bioactive incentives within the network pharmacology together with pharmaceutical drugs and self-care interventions. Since approximately 50% of chronically-ill patients do not take pharmaceutical drugs as prescribed, psychobehavioral incentives may appeal to patients at risk for medication non-adherence. For epilepsy, the incentive-based network therapy comprises anticonvulsant drugs, antiseizure natural products (n-3 PUFA, curcumin or/and resveratrol) coupled with disease-specific behavioral interventions delivered by mobile medical apps. The add-on combination of antiseizure natural products and mHealth supports patient empowerment and intrinsic motivation by having a choice in self-care behaviors. The incentivized therapies offer opportunities: (1) to improve clinical efficacy and safety of existing drugs, (2) to catalyze patient-centered, disease self-management and behavior-changing habits, also improving health-related quality-of-life after reaching remission, and (3) merging copyrighted mHealth software with natural products, thus establishing an intellectual property protection of medical treatments comprising the natural products existing in public domain and currently promoted as dietary supplements. Taken together, clinical research on synergies between existing drugs and pleiotropic natural products, and their integration with self-care, music and mHealth, expands precision/personalized medicine strategies for chronic diseases via pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies."

BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation is a major risk for a suicide attempt in younger people, such that reducing severity of ideation is an important target for suicide prevention. Smartphone applications present a new opportunity for managing ideation in young adults; however, confirmatory evidence for efficacy from randomized trials is lacking. The objective of this study was to assess whether a therapeutic smartphone application (""LifeBuoy"") was superior to an attention-matched control application at reducing the severity of suicidal ideation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this 2-arm parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 455 young adults from Australia experiencing recent suicidal ideation and aged 18 to 25 years were randomly assigned in a 2:2 ratio to use a smartphone application for 6 weeks in May 2020, with the final follow-up in October 2020. The primary outcome was change in suicidal ideation symptom severity scores from baseline (T0) to postintervention (T1) and 3-month postintervention follow-up (T2), measured using the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). Secondary outcomes were symptom changes in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), distress (Distress Questionnaire-5, DQ5), and well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, SWEMWBS). This trial was conducted online, using a targeted social media recruitment strategy. The intervention groups were provided with a self-guided smartphone application based on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; ""LifeBuoy"") to improve emotion regulation and distress tolerance. The control group were provided a smartphone application that looked like LifeBuoy (""LifeBuoy-C""), but delivered general (nontherapeutic) information on a range of health and lifestyle topics. Among 228 participants randomized to LifeBuoy, 110 did not complete the final survey; among 227 participants randomized to the control condition, 91 did not complete the final survey. All randomized participants were included in the intent-to-treat analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes. There was a significant time × condition effect for suicidal ideation scores in favor of LifeBuoy at T1 (p < 0.001, d = 0.45) and T2 (p = 0.007, d = 0.34). There were no superior intervention effects for LifeBuoy on any secondary mental health outcomes from baseline to T1 or T2 [p-values: 0.069 to 0.896]. No serious adverse events (suicide attempts requiring medical care) were reported. The main limitations of the study are the lack of sample size calculations supporting the study to be powered to detect changes in secondary outcomes and a high attrition rate at T2, which may lead efficacy to be overestimated. CONCLUSIONS: LifeBuoy was associated with superior improvements in suicidal ideation severity, but not secondary mental health outcomes, compared to the control application, LifeBuoy-C. Digital therapeutics may need to be purposefully designed to target a specific health outcome to have efficacy.

10.2196/39516,The Effect of Mental Health App Customization on Depressive Symptoms in College Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Six SG, Byrne KA, Aly H, Harris MW.",JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022.8.9,,,"BACKGROUND: Mental health apps have shown promise in improving mental health symptoms, including depressive symptoms. However, limited research has been aimed at understanding how specific app features and designs can optimize the therapeutic benefits and adherence to such mental health apps. OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of avatar customization on depressive symptoms and adherence to use a novel cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mental health app. The secondary aim is to examine whether specific app features, including journaling, mood tracking, and reminders, affect the usability of the mental health app. METHODS: College students were recruited from a university study recruitment pool website and via flyer advertisements throughout campus. A total of 94 participants completed a randomized controlled trial in which they were randomized to either customization or no customization version of the app. Customization involved personalizing a virtual avatar and a travel vehicle to one's own preferences and use of one's name throughout the app. Participants completed a 14-day trial using a novel CBT-based mental health app called AirHeart. Self-report scores for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Postintervention survey measures also included usability and avatar identification questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 94 enrolled participants, 83 (88%) completed the intervention and postintervention assessments. AirHeart app use significantly reduced symptoms of depression (P=.006) from baseline to the end of the 2-week intervention period for all participants, regardless of the customization condition. However, no differences in depressive symptoms (P=.17) or adherence (P=.80) were observed between the customization (39/83, 47%) and no customization (44/83, 53%) conditions. The frequency of journaling, usefulness of mood tracking, and helpfulness of reminders were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms or adherence (P>.05). Exploratory analyses showed that there were 3 moderate positive correlations between avatar identification and depressive symptoms (identification: r=-0.312, P=.02; connection: r=-0.305, P=.02; and lack of relatability: r=0.338, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CBT mental health apps, such as AirHeart, have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms over a short intervention period. The randomized controlled trial results demonstrated that customization of app features, such as avatars, does not further reduce depressive symptoms over and above the CBT modules and standard app features, including journal, reminders, and mood tracking. However, further research elucidating the relationship between virtual avatar identification and mental health systems is needed as society becomes increasingly more digitized. These findings have potential implications for improving the optimization of mental health app designs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Open Science Framework t28gm; https://osf.io/t28gm."

Low levels of treatment seeking and treatment adherence in this age group, combined with a growing national crisis in access to mental health care, have increased efforts to identify effective treatment alternatives for this demographic. Digital health interventions for mental illness can provide cost-effective, engaging, and accessible means of delivering psychotherapy to adolescents. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a virtual randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a self-guided, mobile app-based implementation of behavioral activation therapy, SparkRx, for the adjunct treatment of symptoms of depression in adolescents. METHODS: Participants are recruited directly through web-based and print advertisements. Following eligibility screening and consenting, participants are randomly assigned to a treatment arm (SparkRx) or a control arm (assessment-enhanced usual care) for 5 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome, total score on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), is assessed at the end of the 5-week intervention period. Additional participant-reported outcomes are assessed at baseline, the postintervention time point, and 1-month follow-up. The safety of the intervention is assessed by participant report (and legal guardian report, if the participant is younger than 18 years) and by patterns of symptom deterioration on the PHQ-8, as part of a larger clinical safety monitoring protocol. The primary efficacy outcome, total PHQ-8 score at the postintervention time point, will be compared between SparkRx and enhanced usual care arms using mixed effect modeling, with baseline PHQ-8 and current antidepressant medication status included as covariates. Secondary efficacy outcomes, including the proportion of participants exhibiting treatment response, remission, and minimal clinically significant improvement (all derived from total PHQ-8 scores), will be compared between groups using chi-square tests. Symptom severity at 1-month follow-up will also be compared between arms. Planned subgroup analyses will examine the robustness of treatment effects to differences in baseline symptom severity (PHQ-8 score <15 or ≥ 15) and age (younger than 18 years and older than 18 years). The primary safety outcome, the number of psychiatric serious adverse events, will be compared between trial arms using the Fisher exact test. All other adverse events will be presented descriptively. RESULTS: As of May 2023, enrollment into the study has concluded; 223 participants were randomized. The analysis of the efficacy and safety data is expected to be completed by Fall 2023. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the results of this trial will support the efficacy and safety of SparkRx in attenuating symptoms of depression in adolescents. Positive results would more broadly support the prospect of using accessible, scientifically validated, digital therapeutics in the adjunct treatment of mental health disorders in this age range.

This is particularly relevant to low-income and middle-income countries where 90% of the world's adolescents live. While digital delivery of behavioural activation (BA) presents a promising solution, its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness among adolescents in an African context remain to be shown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a two-arm single-blind individual-level randomised controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and initial efficacy of digitally delivered BA therapy among adolescents with depression. The intervention has been coproduced with adolescents at the study site. The study is based in the rural northeast of South Africa in the Bushbuckridge subdistrict of Mpumalanga province. A total of 200 adolescents with symptoms of mild to moderately severe depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire Adolescent Version will be recruited (1:1 allocation ratio). The treatment group will receive BA therapy via a smartphone application (the Kuamsha app) supported by trained peer mentors. The control group will receive an enhanced standard of care. The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated using a mixed methods design, and signals of the initial efficacy of the intervention in reducing symptoms of depression will be determined on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary objectives are to pilot a range of cognitive, mental health, risky behaviour and socioeconomic measures; and to collect descriptive data on the feasibility of trial procedures to inform the development of a further larger trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee (MED20-05-011) and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC 34-20).

Acad Psychiatry. 2018 Oct;42(5):677-678. doi: 10.1007/s40596-018-0971-x. OBJECTIVE: Being a healthcare professional can be a uniquely rewarding calling. However, the demands of training and practice can lead to chronic distress and serious psychological, interpersonal, and personal health burdens. Although higher burnout, depression, and suicide rates have been reported in healthcare professionals, only a minority receive treatment. Concerns regarding confidentiality, stigma, potential career implications, and cost and time constraints are cited as key barriers. Web-based and mobile applications have been shown to mitigate stress, burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among several populations and may circumvent these barriers. Here, we reviewed published data on such resources and selected a small sample that readily can be used by healthcare providers. METHODS: We searched PubMed for articles evaluating stress, burnout, depression, and suicide prevention or intervention for healthcare students or providers and identified five categories of programs with significant effectiveness: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (online), meditation, mindfulness, breathing, and relaxation techniques. Using these categories, we searched for Web-based (through Google and beacon.anu.edu.au -a wellness resource website) and mobile applications (Apple and mobile. va.gov/appstore ) for stress, burnout, depression, and suicide prevention and identified 36 resources to further evaluate based on relevance, applicability to healthcare providers (confidentiality, convenience, and cost), and the strength of findings supporting their effectiveness. RESULTS: We selected seven resources under five general categories designed to foster wellness and reduce burnout, depression, and suicide risk among healthcare workers: breathing (Breath2Relax), meditation (Headspace, guided meditation audios), Web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MoodGYM, Stress Gym), and suicide prevention apps (Stay Alive, Virtual Hope Box). CONCLUSIONS: This list serves as a starting point to enhance coping with stressors as a healthcare student or professional in order to help mitigate burnout, depression, and suicidality. The next steps include adapting digital health strategies to specifically fit the needs of healthcare providers, with the ultimate goal of facilitating in-person care when warranted."

Digital interventions are considered a low-threshold treatment option for people with suicidal ideation or behaviors. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) targeting suicidal ideation has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation. However, suicidal ideation often is related to additional mental health problems, which should be addressed for optimal care. Yet, the effects of iCBT on related symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze whether digital interventions targeting suicidal ideation had an effect on related mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, and hopelessness). METHODS: We systematically searched CENTRAL, PsycInfo, Embase, and PubMed for randomized controlled trials that investigated guided or unguided iCBT for suicidal ideation or behaviors. Participants reporting baseline suicidal ideation were eligible. Individual participant data (IPD) were collected from eligible trials. We conducted a 1-stage IPD meta-analysis on the effects on depression, anxiety, and hopelessness-analyzed as 2 indices: symptom severity and treatment response. RESULTS: We included IPD from 8 out of 9 eligible trials comprising 1980 participants with suicidal ideation. iCBT was associated with significant reductions in depression severity (b=-0.17; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09; P<.001) and higher treatment response (ie, 50% reduction of depressive symptoms; b=0.36; 95% CI 0.12-0.60; P=.008) after treatment. We did not find significant effects on anxiety and hopelessness. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT for people with suicidal ideation revealed significant effects on depression outcomes but only minor or no effects on anxiety and hopelessness. Therefore, individuals with comorbid symptoms of anxiety or hopelessness may require additional treatment components to optimize care. Studies that monitor symptoms with higher temporal resolution and consider a broader spectrum of factors influencing suicidal ideation are needed to understand the complex interaction of suicidality and related mental health symptoms."
10.2196/38005,Improvements in Depression Outcomes Following a Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention in a Polychronic Population: Retrospective Study,"Venkatesan A, Forster B, Rao P, Miller M, Scahill M.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.7.5,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions have shown promise in reducing barriers to effective care for depression. Depression and related mental disorders are known to be highly comorbid with common chronic physical conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. While some research has explored the interaction dynamics of treating populations living with both mental and physical disorders, very little is known about such dynamics in digital care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week, therapist-supported, app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety. The studied population included adults with a heavy burden of chronic physical disease, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 1512 participants with at least moderate depression were enrolled. The treatment cohort consisted of 831 (54.96%) participants who completed a follow-up assessment. The program included structured lessons and tools (ie, exercises and practices) and offered one-on-one weekly video counseling sessions with a licensed therapist for 12 weeks and monthly sessions thereafter. The clinically validated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Linear mixed-effects modeling was employed to examine changes in depression and anxiety over time. Given correlation among various measures of program usage, a composite variable for depth of usage was used to analyze the correlation between usage and changes in depressive symptoms. Body weight changes from baseline were assessed primarily with digitally connected scales. RESULTS: Out of 831 participants in the treatment cohort, 74.5% (n=619) showed a clinically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity after 12 weeks, where follow-up PHQ-8 scores had shifted downward by at least one diagnostic category. In total, 67.5% (n=561) of the participants showed a reliable improvement in PHQ-8 scores as measured by the reliable change index. There was an average reduction of 5.9 (SD 5.2) points (P<.001) between baseline and follow-up. Greater program usage was correlated with greater likelihood of reliable improvement in depressive symptoms (odds ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5; P=.002). An exploratory analysis of body weight changes with a multilevel, mixed-effect model suggested that reliable improvement in depressive symptoms at follow-up was associated with significantly greater weight loss at 9 months (β=-1.11, P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: The results provide further support that digital interventions can support clinically meaningful improvements in depression. Some form of synergy in treatment of comorbid depression and obesity or diabetes could be studied in future research. The study was limited by postintervention participant attrition as well as the retrospective observational study design."

However, which skills provided in iCBT packages are more effective than others is unclear. Such knowledge can inform construction of more effective and efficient iCBT programmes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of five components of iCBT for subthreshold depression. METHODS: We conducted an factorial trial using a smartphone app, randomly allocating presence or absence of five iCBT skills including self-monitoring, behavioural activation (BA), cognitive restructuring (CR), assertiveness training (AT) and problem-solving. Participants were university students with subthreshold depression. The primary outcome was the change on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from baseline to week 8. Secondary outcomes included changes in CBT skills. FINDINGS: We randomised a total of 1093 participants. In all groups, participants had a significant PHQ-9 reduction from baseline to week 8. Depression reduction was not significantly different between presence or absence of any component, with corresponding standardised mean differences (negative values indicate specific efficacy in favour of the component) ranging between -0.04 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.08) for BA and 0.06 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.18) for AT. Specific CBT skill improvements were noted for CR and AT but not for the others. CONCLUSIONS: There was significant reduction in depression for all participants regardless of the presence and absence of the examined iCBT components. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: We cannot yet make evidence-based recommendations for specific iCBT components. We suggest that future iCBT optimisation research should scrutinise the amount and structure of components to examine. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMINCTR-000031307."
10.2196/50098,A Digital Behavioral Activation Intervention (JuNEX) for Pregnant Women With Subclinical Depression Symptoms: Explorative Co-Design Study,"Mancinelli E, Gabrielli S, Salcuni S.",JMIR Hum Factors,2024,2024.5.16,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions are gaining increasing interest due to their structured nature, ready availability, and self-administered capabilities. Perinatal women have expressed a desire for such interventions. In this regard, behavioral activation interventions may be particularly suitable for digital administration. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to exploratorily investigate and compare the feasibility of the internet-based self-help guided versus unguided version of the Brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression-Revised, an empirically supported in-person behavioral activation protocol, targeting pregnant women with subclinical depression symptoms. A user-centered design is used, whereby data are collected with the intent of evaluating how to adjust the intervention in line with pregnant women's needs. Usability and user engagement were evaluated. METHODS: A total of 11 Italian pregnant women with subclinical depressive symptoms based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (scoring<15) participated in this study; of them, 6 (55%) women were randomly assigned to the guided group (age: mean 32.17, SD 4.36 years) and 5 (45%) to the unguided group (age: mean 31, SD 4.95 years). The Moodle platform was used to deliver the interventions in an e-learning format. It consisted of 6 core modules and 3 optional modules; the latter aimed at revising the content of the former. In the guided group, each woman had weekly chats with their assigned human guide to support them in the homework revisions. The intervention content included text, pictures, and videos. Semistructured interviews were conducted, and descriptive statistics were analyzed. RESULTS: Collectively, the data suggest that the guided intervention was better accepted than the unguided one. However, the high rates of dropout (at T6: guided group: 3/6, 50%; unguided: 4/5, 80%) suggest that a digital replica of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression-Revised may not be feasible in an e-learning format. The reduced usability of the platform used was reported, and homework was perceived as too time-consuming and effort-intensive. Moreover, the 6 core modules were deemed sufficient for the intervention's goals, suggesting that the 3 optional modules could be eliminated. Nevertheless, participants from both groups expressed satisfaction with the content and found it relevant to their pregnancy experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings have emphasized both the intervention's merits and shortcomings. Results highlight the unsuitability of replicating an in-person protocol digitally as well as of the use of nonprofessional tools for the implementation of self-help interventions, ultimately making the intervention not feasible. Pregnant women have nonetheless expressed a desire to receive psychological support and commented on the possibilities of digital psychosocial supports, particularly those that are app-based. The information collected and the issues identified here are important to guide the development and co-design of a more refined platform for the intervention deployment and to tailor the intervention's content to pregnant women's needs."
10.2196/26453,"Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Quality of Resilience-Building Mobile Health Apps for Military, Veteran, and Public Safety Personnel Populations: Scoping Literature Review and App Evaluation","Voth M, Chisholm S, Sollid H, Jones C, Smith-MacDonald L, Brémault-Phillips S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022.1.19,,,"Erratum in JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Aug 28;11:e51609. doi: 10.2196/51609. BACKGROUND: Military members (MMs) and public safety personnel (PSP) are vulnerable to occupational stress injuries because of their job demands. When MMs and PSP transition out of these professions, they may continue to experience mental health challenges. The development and implementation of resilience-building mobile health (mHealth) apps as an emergent mental health intervention platform has allowed for targeted, cost-effective, and easily accessible treatment when in-person therapy may be limited or unavailable. However, current mHealth app development is not regulated, and often lacks both clear evidence-based research and the input of health care professionals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the evidence-based quality, efficacy, and effectiveness of resilience-building mobile apps targeted toward the MMs, PSP, and veteran populations via a scoping literature review of the current evidence base regarding resilience apps for these populations and an evaluation of free resilience apps designed for use among these populations. METHODS: The studies were selected using a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, Academic Search Complete, Embase, and Google and were guided by PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A narrative synthesis of the resulting papers was performed. The Alberta Rating Index for Apps was used to conduct a review of each of the identified apps. The inclusion criteria consisted of apps that were free to download in either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store; updated within the last 3 years; available in English and in Canada; and intended for use by MMs, veterans, and PSP. RESULTS: In total, 22 apps met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. The resilience strategies offered by most apps included psychoeducation, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Overall, 50% (11/22) of apps had been tested in randomized controlled trials, 7 (32%) apps had been evaluated using other research methods, and 5 (23%) apps had not been studied. Using the Alberta Rating Index for Apps, the app scores ranged from 37 to 56 out of 72, with higher rated apps demonstrating increased usability and security features. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth apps reviewed are well-suited to providing resilience strategies for MMs, PSP, and veterans. They offer easy accessibility to evidence-based tools while working to encourage the use of emotional and professional support with safety in mind. Although not intended to function as a substitute for professional services, research has demonstrated that mHealth apps have the potential to foster a significant reduction in symptom severity for posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. In clinical practice, apps can be used to supplement treatment and provide clients with population-specific confidential tools to increase engagement in the treatment process."
10.1016/j.beth.2019.03.007,Development and Pilot Testing of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Digital Service for Body Dysmorphic Disorder,"Wilhelm S, Weingarden H, Greenberg JL, McCoy TH, Ladis I, Summers BJ, Matic A, Harrison O.",Behav Ther,2020,2020.2.2,,,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has a severe presentation and chronic course when untreated. Although effective BDD treatments exist, most individuals do not have access to them. We therefore developed and pilot tested the first smartphone-delivered individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for adults with BDD. The digital service was developed via user-centered design, integrating input from engineering, design, and psychology experts, plus BDD patient consultants. We conducted a 12-week open pilot trial (N = 10) to describe preliminary results for feasibility, acceptability, and treatment outcome. Attrition rates (0%) and feedback on usability and satisfaction indicated that smartphone-based CBT for BDD may be feasible, acceptable, and satisfactory. Initial results suggest that smartphone-based CBT for BDD may hold promise for improving BDD symptom severity, BDD-related insight, functional impairment, and quality of life, as scores from baseline to posttreatment improved with large-to-very large effects; depression improved with a medium effect. Ninety percent of participants were responders at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Smartphone-based CBT for BDD may have strong potential as a standardized, low cost, and accessible treatment for this debilitating illness. A test of efficacy is merited as a next step, using a well-powered, randomized control trial design."

We confirmed that the experimental group performed significantly more health promoting behaviours than the control group (F = 5.15, p = 0.007). However, there was no significant difference in postpartum depression, knowledge of depression, maladaptive beliefs, social support, sleep quality, and stress-coping behaviours between the two groups. The experimental group's mood score increased by 1.79 ± 2.51 points, resulting in significant differences before and after the intervention (Z = -2.81, p = 0.005). The quality of sleep score in the experimental group increased by 1.48 ± 1.70 points and was also significantly different after the intervention (Z = -3.23, p = 0.001). The activity practice rate of the experimental group significantly increased by 30.27 ± 29.27% after using the app (Z = -2.81, p = 0.005).

10.1016/j.jad.2025.04.075,"Mobile app-based intervention for paternal perinatal depression, anxiety, and stress: A randomised controlled trial","Teague SJ, Shatte ABR, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M, Hutchinson DM.",J Affect Disord,2025,2025.4.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Paternal perinatal mental health significantly impacts family outcomes, yet fathers are often overlooked and underserved in mental health services. This study evaluates the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy intervention delivered via mobile app to address paternal perinatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. METHOD: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with perinatal fathers experiencing moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms. Participants were assigned to either the Rover app mindfulness-based CBT intervention (n = 81) or an active control app, moodmonitor (n = 75). Primary outcomes were depression (EPDS), anxiety, and stress (DASS21); secondary outcomes included social support, parenting self-efficacy, and couple relationship quality. Post-test analysis occurred at four weeks, with an additional eight-week follow-up for the intervention group. RESULTS: Contrary to hypotheses, no differences were found between groups for depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Both groups showed significant reductions in anxiety (intervention d = -1.7, control d = -1.94) and stress (intervention d = -2.9, control d = -2.8) and improved couple relationship quality. Rover users maintained improvements at 8-week follow-up. Fathers with severe baseline depression experienced greater reductions in depression using the Rover app (b = 5.36, p < 0.01). LIMITATIONS: Low adherence to the intervention and moderate attrition over the study duration. CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention was acceptable to fathers, treatment adherence was low, highlighting the need for more engaging content. App-based interventions show potential benefits for paternal mental health, but user engagement must be improved. This study contributes to the growing literature on digital interventions for fathers' mental health and emphasizes the importance of including fathers in perinatal mental health research.

Evidence-based treatments for depression are available, but access to them is still limited in some instances. As technology has become more integrated into mental health care, computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols have become available and have been recently transposed to mobile environments (e.g., smartphones) in the form of ""apps."" Preliminary research on some depression apps has shown promising results in reducing subthreshold or mild to moderate depressive symptoms. However, this small number of studies reports a low statistical power and they have not yet been replicated. Moreover, none of them included an active placebo comparison group. This is problematic, as a ""digital placebo effect"" may explain some of the positive effects documented until now. The aim of this study is to test a newly developed mobile app firmly grounded in the CBT theory of depression to determine whether this app is clinically useful in decreasing moderate depressive symptoms when compared with an active placebo. Additionally, we are interested in the app's effect on emotional wellbeing and depressogenic cognitions. METHODS/DESIGN: Romanian-speaking adults (18 years and older) with access to a computer and the Internet and owning a smartphone are included in the study. A randomized, three-arm clinical trial is being conducted (i.e., active intervention, placebo intervention and delayed intervention). Two hundred and twenty participants with moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., obtaining scores >9 and ≤16 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be randomized to the three conditions. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting serious mental health problems, or legal or health issues that would prevent them from using the app, as well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. Participants randomized to the active and placebo interventions will use the smartphone app for 6 weeks. A short therapist check-in via phone will take place every week. Participants in the delayed-intervention condition will be given access to the app after 6 weeks from randomization. The primary outcome is the level of depressive symptomatology. The intervention delivered through the app to the active condition includes psychoeducational materials and exercises based on CBT for depression, while the placebo intervention uses a sham version of the app (i.e., similar structure of courses and exercises). DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this study protocol is the first to test the efficacy of a smartphone app for depressive symptomatology in the form of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that includes an active placebo condition. As such, this can substantially add to the body of evidence supporting the use of apps designed to decrease depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03060200 .

Individuals experiencing impairment due to depressive symptomatology are most likely to report their symptoms to a primary care provider. As such, national guidelines highlight the need to assess and effectively treat depression via primary care. Despite these guidelines, the dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapy via primary care is limited, likely due to both provider- and patient-level treatment barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are promising for addressing these barriers and for promoting uptake of evidence-based depression treatment. Among evidence-based psychotherapies for depression, brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) has shown great promise and is particularly amenable to mHealth delivery. Herein, we discuss the development of a BATD mobile application, Moodivate, that was developed in order to disseminate BATD via primary care. This paper focuses on description of (1) rationale for Moodivate treatment development, (2) Moodivate treatment components, (3) ongoing clinical trial evaluation of Moodivate, and (4) clinical considerations for incorporating Moodivate into clinical practice."

DESIGN: We conducted a rapid review of systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and risk of bias evaluation. A standardised extraction form was used. Data are reported narratively. INTERVENTIONS: We included systematic reviews of digital health interventions aiming to prevent, detect or manage mental health problems in individuals with a pre-existing chronic disease, including chronic mental health illnesses, published in 2010 or after. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reports on mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms). RESULTS: We included 35 reviews, totalling 702 primary studies with a total sample of 50 692 participants. We structured the results in four population clusters: (1) chronic diseases, (2) cancer, (3) mental health and (4) children and youth. For populations presenting a chronic disease or cancer, health provider directed digital interventions (eg, web-based consultation, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy) are effective and safe. Further analyses are required in order to provide stronger recommendations regarding relevance for specific population (such as children and youth). Web-based interventions and email were the modes of administration that had the most reports of improvement. Virtual reality, smartphone applications and patient portal had limited reports of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Digital technologies could be used to prevent and manage mental health problems in people living with chronic conditions, with consideration for the age group and type of technology used."

Apps could substantially improve treatment access. OBJECTIVE: We provide an initial test of the usability and efficacy of coach-supported app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for BDD. The Perspectives app covers core treatment components: psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, exposure with response prevention, mindfulness, attention retraining, and relapse prevention. METHODS: A randomized waitlist-controlled trial was conducted. Adults (N = 80) with primary BDD were assigned to 12 weeks of Perspectives or waitlist. Coaches promoted engagement and answered questions via in-app messaging and phone calls. BDD severity was measured at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment by blinded independent evaluators (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD; BDD-YBOCS). Secondary outcomes included BDD-related insight, depression, quality of life, and functioning. RESULTS: App uptake and satisfaction were high. In intent-to-treat analyses, Perspectives app-based CBT was associated with significantly lower BDD-YBOCS severity at end of treatment (M [SD]: 16.8 [7.5]) compared to the waitlist (26.7 [6.2]; p < 0.001, d = 1.44). App-based CBT was associated with greater improvements across all secondary measures, with medium to large effects.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS. METHODS: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS-QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, IBS-QoL, GI-COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F1,79=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F1,79=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; F1,79=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F1,79=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F1,79=12.13, P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ-9 (F1,79=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F1,79=6.03, P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F1,79=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its relatively benign physical profile, IBS can be an extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this evidence-based treatment.

The purpose of the present study was to preliminarily examine the feasibility and efficacy of a self-help brief behavioral activation mobile application (app; ""Moodivate"") for depressive symptoms among adults treated via primary care. Participants (N = 52) were recruited from primary care practices between January and December 2017 and were randomized 2:2:1 to receive (a) Moodivate, (b) an active control cognitive-behavioral therapy-based mobile app (""MoodKit""), or (c) treatment as usual (TAU; no app). Participants completed assessments of depressive symptoms weekly for 8 weeks. App analytics data were captured to examine Moodivate feasibility (analytics unavailable for control app). Moodivate participants on average had 46.76 (SD = 30.10) app sessions throughout the trial duration, spent 3.50 (2.76) minutes using the app per session, and spent 120.76 (101.02) minutes using the app in total throughout the trial. Nearly 70% of Moodivate participants continued to use the app 1 month after trial enrollment and 50% at the end of the 8-week follow-up period. A generalized estimating equation model examining change in depressive symptoms over time by treatment condition indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment condition (χ2 = 42.21, df = 14, p < .001). As compared to TAU, participants in both app conditions evidenced significant decreases in depressive symptoms over time, and these treatment gains were sustained across the trial period. These results preliminarily indicate feasibility of Moodivate as well as efficacy of both Moodivate and MoodKit for the treatment of depression among adults recruited via primary care. Future studies should focus on larger-scale examinations of treatment efficacy and effectiveness across primary care settings."

BACKGROUND: In the treatment of major depression, antidepressants are effective but not curative. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, but accessibility is a problem. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT app as adjunctive therapy among patients with antidepressant-resistant major depression. METHODS: A multisite, assessor-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 psychiatric clinics and hospitals in Japan. Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression and were antidepressant-refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1-week run-in in which participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone app, called Kokoro-app (""kokoro"" means ""mind"" in Japanese), included sessions on self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by cartoon characters. The primary outcome was depression severity as assessed by masked telephone assessors with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at week 9. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER). RESULTS: In the total sample (N=164), 81 participants were allocated to the smartphone CBT in addition to medication change and 83 to medication change alone. In the former group, all but one participant (80/81, 99%) completed at least half, and 71 (88%) completed at least six of eight sessions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients allocated the CBT app scored 2.48 points (95% CI 1.23-3.72, P<.001; standardized mean difference 0.40) lower on PHQ-9 than the control at week 9. The former group also scored 4.1 points (95% CI 1.5-6.6, P=.002) lower on BDI-II and 0.76 points (95% CI -0.05 to 1.58, P=.07) lower on FIBSER. In the per-protocol sample (comfortable with the smartphone app, still symptomatic, and adherent to medication with mild or less side effects after run-in), the intervention group (n=60) scored 1.72 points (95% CI 0.25-3.18, P=.02) lower on PHQ-9, 3.2 points (95% CI -0.01 to 6.3, P=.05) lower on BDI-II, and 0.75 points (95% CI 0.03-1.47, P=.04) lower on FIBSER than the control (n=57). The treatment benefits were maintained up to week 17. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT in the treatment of clinically diagnosed depression. Given the merits of the mobile mental health intervention, including accessibility, affordability, quality control, and effectiveness, it is clinically worthwhile to consider adjunctive use of a smartphone CBT app when treating patients with antidepressant-resistant depression.

10.2196/36806,Patient and Therapist Expectations for a Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for Depression: Qualitative Exploratory Study,"Atik E, Schückes M, Apolinário-Hagen J.",JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022.12.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of digital elements and face-to-face psychotherapy-has been proposed to alleviate challenges that patients and therapists face in conventional cognitive behavioral therapy. There is growing evidence that adding digital elements to face-to-face psychotherapy can contribute to better treatment outcomes. However, bCBT programs still show considerable shortcomings, and knowledge on how to improve digital apps using a bCBT protocol is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to inductively identify functions and qualities that are expected from a bCBT treatment for depression in the eyes of patients and psychotherapists who were not currently receiving or practicing bCBT treatment. METHODS: We used a qualitative exploratory study design and conducted 3 focus group interviews (n=6 in each) and 5 semistructured in-depth interviews with therapists as well as 11 individual interviews with patients with a primary diagnosis of depression and currently undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy treatment in Germany. Themes and categories were established inductively from transcribed interview records based on a rigorous coding method. RESULTS: Both therapists and patients expected a digital app to provide patients with the opportunity to track their mood, work on therapeutic homework activities, easily access an intervention set for harder moments, and efficiently facilitate administrative tasks. The desire to be able to customize bCBT protocols to individual patient circumstances was evident in both patient and therapist interviews. Patients differed with respect to what content and the amount of material the app should focus on as well as the method of recording experiences. Therapists viewed digital apps as potentially aiding in their documentation work outside of sessions. Different attitudes surfaced on the topic of data security, with patients not as concerned as therapists. CONCLUSIONS: Both patients and therapists had substantially positive attitudes toward the option of an integrated bCBT treatment. Our study presents novel findings on the expectations and attitudes of patients and therapists."
10.2196/49998,The Appa Health App for Youth Mental Health: Development and Usability Study,"Giovanelli A, Sanchez Karver T, Roundfield KD, Woodruff S, Wierzba C, Wolny J, Kaufman MR.",JMIR Form Res,2023,2023.10.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Demand for adolescent mental health services has surged in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and traditional models of care entailing in-person services with licensed mental health providers are inadequate to meet demand. However, research has shown that with proper training and supervision mentors can work with youth with mental health challenges like depression and anxiety and can even support the use of evidence-based strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In our increasingly connected world, youth mentors can meet with young people on a web-based platform at their convenience, reducing barriers to care. Moreover, the internet has made evidence-based CBT skills for addressing depression and anxiety more accessible than ever. As such, when trained and supervised by licensed clinicians, mentors are an untapped resource to support youth with mental health challenges. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of Appa Health (Appa), an evidence-based mental health mentoring program for youth experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. This paper describes the development, pilot testing process, and preliminary quantitative and qualitative outcomes of Appa's 12-week smartphone app program which combines web-based near-peer mentorship with short-form TikTok-style videos teaching CBT skills created by licensed mental health professionals who are also social media influencers. METHODS: The development and testing processes were executed through collaboration with key stakeholders, including young people and clinical and research advisory boards. In the pilot study, young people were assessed for symptoms of depression or anxiety using standard self-report clinical measures: the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scales. Teenagers endorsing symptoms of depression or anxiety (n=14) were paired with a mentor (n=10) based on preferred characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) status. Quantitative survey data about the teenagers' characteristics, mental health, and feasibility and acceptability were combined with qualitative data assessing youth perspectives on the program, their mentors, and the CBT content. RESULTS: Participants reported finding Appa helpful, with 100% (n=14) of teenagers expressing that they felt better after the 12-week program. Over 85% (n=12) said they would strongly recommend the program to a friend. The teenagers were engaged, video chatting with mentors consistently over the 12 weeks. Metrics of anxiety and depressive symptoms reduced consistently from week 1 to week 12, supporting qualitative data suggesting that mentoring combined with CBT strategies has the potential to positively impact youth mental health and warrants further study. CONCLUSIONS: Appa Health is a novel smartphone app aiming to improve the well-being of youth and reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms through web-based mentoring and engaging CBT video content. This formative research sets the stage for a large-scale randomized controlled trial recently funded by the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research program."
10.1037/rep0000403,Ecological momentary assessment of affect in context after traumatic brain injury,"Rabinowitz A, Hart T, Wilson J.",Rehabil Psychol,2021,2021.9.13,,,"PURPOSE: To describe where, with whom, and how time was spent daily, and to characterize positive and negative affect, boredom, enjoyment, and perceived accomplishment as a function of time, activity, location, and social context, in people with chronic moderate-severe traumatic brain injury and depression/anxiety. RESEARCH METHOD: Participants (N = 23) responded to a smartphone app five times daily for approximately 2 weeks prior to treatment in a trial of Behavioral Activation. The app queried activity and physical/social context; concurrent positive and negative affect; and perceived boredom, enjoyment, and accomplishment. Descriptive statistics captured time use, and linear mixed models were used to analyze relations between affect and contextual factors. RESULTS: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) response rate was positively correlated with integrity of episodic memory and education. Participants spent most time at home versus elsewhere, and alone versus with others. The most frequent activity was watching TV. Mixed model results based on 17 participants with >33% response rate showed that positive affect was associated with being outside of home, and with other people; however, socializing was related to higher negative affect. TV watching was related to lower negative affect but also low accomplishment. CONCLUSIONS: EMA can provide unique information on the effects of social context and activity on mood in TBI. Clinicians should consider negative as well as positive affect associated with increasing social participation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."
10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1229380,Behavioral activation for depression in groups embedded in psychosomatic rehabilitation inpatient treatment: a quasi-randomized controlled study,"Melicherova U, Schott T, Köllner V, Hoyer J.",Front Psychiatry,2024,2024.5.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have shown to be efficacious treatment methods for depression. Previous studies focused mostly on the outpatient treatment either in group or individual setting. The present study aimed at comparing the efficacy of group treatment BA vs. CBT, when embedded in inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation treatment. METHODS: 375 inpatients were randomly assigned to either BA (N = 174) or CBT (N = 201). We used established scales for depression such as the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II, self-rating), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS; expert rating) and the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) to assess changes over the course of the treatment and at follow-up (4 to 6 months). In addition, we measured disability-related functioning with the Mini-ICF-APP, a rating scale built in reference to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Multilevel models with repeated measures were conducted to examine the differences between groups in relation to change over time with patients' random effects. RESULTS: Both group formats showed substantial reduction in depressive symptoms at the end of treatment (d= 0.83 BA vs. d= 1.08 CBT; BDI-II) and at follow-up after 4 to 6 months (d = 0.97 BA vs. d = 1.33 CBT, BDI-II; and d = 1.17 BA vs. d = 1.09 CBT, QIDS). There were no significant differences between treatment approaches. At least 50% symptom reduction was achieved by 53.7% and 54.2% in BA vs. CBT respectively. Reported activation levels increased from pre- to posttreatment (d = 0.76 BA vs. d = 0.70CBT), while showing loss of increment between the end of the treatment until follow up in both formats (d = 0.28 BA vs. d = 0.29 CBT). DISCUSSION: Both modalities led to significant improvement of symptomatology and functioning at the end of the treatment and at follow-up, thus for the first time demonstrating the practicability of BA in rehabilitation clinics. Considering its lower requirements regarding cognitive abilities and its easier implementation, BA proved to be a good alternative to other psychotherapeutic treatments."
10.2196/40242,Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Adolescents With Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility and Acceptability Study,"Nicol G, Wang R, Graham S, Dodd S, Garbutt J.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.11.22,,,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm have escalated among adolescents to crisis levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, primary care providers (PCPs) are often called on to provide first-line care for these youth. Digital health interventions can extend mental health specialty care, but few are evidence based. We evaluated the feasibility of delivering an evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) app with an embedded conversational agent to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to symptomatic adolescents presenting in primary care settings during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this 12-week pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility of delivering the app-based intervention to adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with moderate depressive symptoms who were treated in a practice-based research network (PBRN) of academically affiliated primary care clinics. We also obtained preliminary estimates of app acceptability, effectiveness, and usability. METHODS: This small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated depressive symptom severity in adolescents randomized to the app or to a wait list control condition. The primary end point was depression severity at 4-weeks, measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data on acceptability, feasibility, and usability were collected from adolescents and their parent or legal guardian. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PCPs from 11 PBRN clinics to identify facilitators and barriers to incorporating mental health apps in treatment planning for adolescents with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The pilot randomized 18 participants to the app (n=10, 56%) or to a wait list control condition (n=8, 44%); 17 participants were included in the analysis, and 1 became ineligible upon chart review due to lack of eligibility based on documented diagnosis. The overall sample was predominantly female (15/17, 88%), White (15/17, 88%), and privately insured (15/17, 88%). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 4 weeks decreased by 3.3 points in the active treatment group (representing a shift in mean depression score from moderate to mild symptom severity categories) and 2 points in the wait list control group (no shift in symptom severity category). Teen- and parent-reported usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the app was high. PCPs reported preference for introducing mHealth interventions like the one in this study early in the course of care for individuals presenting with mild or moderate symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study, we demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety of using a CBT-based chatbot for adolescents presenting with moderate depressive symptoms in a network of PBRN-based primary care clinics. This pilot study could not establish effectiveness, but our results suggest that further study in a larger pediatric population is warranted. Future study inclusive of rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and underrepresented communities is needed to establish generalizability of effectiveness and identify implementation-related adaptations needed to promote broader uptake in pediatric primary care.

This study explored the intervention efficacy of a mobile application on addressing psychological problems related to COVID-19. METHODS: A longitudinal control trial involving 129 Chinese participants with depression symptoms was conducted through the mobile application ""Care for Your Mental Health and Sleep during COVID-19"" (CMSC) based on WeChat. Participants were divided into two groups: mobile internet cognitive behavioral therapy (MiCBT) and wait-list. The primary outcome was improvement in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anxiety and insomnia. The MiCBT group received three self-help CBT intervention sessions in one week via CMSC. RESULTS: The MiCBT group showed significant improvement in depression and insomnia (allP < 0.05) compared with the wait-list group. Although both groups showed significant improvement in anxiety at the intervention's end, compared with the wait-list group, the MiCBT group had no significant advantage. Correlation analysis showed that improvement in depression and anxiety had a significant positive association with education level. Changes in insomnia were significantly negatively correlated with anxiety of COVID-19 at the baseline. CMSC was considered helpful (n=68, 81.9 %) and enjoyable (n=54, 65.9 %) in relieving depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: CMSC is verified to be effective and convenient for improving COVID-19-related depression and insomnia symptoms. A large study with sufficient evidence is required to determine its continuous effect on reducing mental health problems during the pandemic."
10.2196/41638,Gamifying Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques on Smartphones for Bangkok's Millennials With Depressive Symptoms: Interdisciplinary Game Development,"Sriwatanathamma P, Sirivesmas V, Simatrang S, Bhowmik NH.",JMIR Serious Games,2023,2023.5.12,,,"BACKGROUND: There is serious concern over the annual increase in depressive symptoms among millennials in Bangkok, Thailand. Their daily routine revolves around the use of their smartphones for work and leisure. Although accessibility to mental health care is expanding, it cannot keep up with the demand for mental health treatment. Outside Thailand, multiple projects and studies have attempted to merge gamification mechanisms and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to create mobile health intervention apps and serious games with positive feedback. This presents an opportunity to explore the same approach in Thailand. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the development process of gamifying CBT techniques to support game mechanics in a visual narrative serious game, BlueLine. The primary target of this research is Bangkok's millennials. In the game, players play as Blue, a Bangkok millennial who struggles to live through societal norms that influence his digital life and relationships. Through in-game scenarios, players will learn and understand how to lessen the impact of depressive symptoms via gamified interactions on their smartphones. METHODS: First, this paper follows each development step of solidifying BlueLine's game structure by integrating the Activating Events, Beliefs, Consequences, Disputation of Beliefs and Effective New Approaches (ABCDE) model and narrative in games. Second, the approach to select CBT and related therapeutic elements for gamification is based on suitability to the game structure. Throughout the process, CBT experts in Thailand have reviewed these scenarios. The approach forms the base of the player's interactions throughout the scenarios in BlueLine, broken down into 4 types of gamified mechanisms: narrative, verbal interactions, physical interactions, and social media interactions. RESULTS: With the game structure based on the ABCDE model, BlueLine scenarios implement gamified mechanisms in conjunction with the following CBT and related therapeutic elements: behavioral activation, self-monitoring, interpersonal skills, positive psychology, relaxation and mindful activities, and problem-solving. In each scenario, players guide Blue to overcome his triggered dysfunctional beliefs. During this process, players can learn and understand how to lessen the impact of depressive symptoms through gamified interactions. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the development process of gamifying CBT and related therapeutic techniques in BlueLine game scenarios. A scenario can harbor multiple techniques, including behavioral activation, self-monitoring, interpersonal skills, positive psychology, relaxation and mindful activities, and problem-solving. BlueLine's game structure does not limit the fact that the same combination of CBT elements ties each gamified mechanism."

However, extant research has not highlighted effective internet-based psychological interventions to improve the mental health in this population during the pandemic. It remains unclear whether self-guided, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs are effective in improving the mental health of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based iCBT stress management program for reducing the depression experienced by nurses in Vietnam and Thailand. METHODS: From March to April 2022, a 2-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was implemented. One arm offered a 7-week self-guided iCBT program, and the other offered treatment as usual as a control arm. Full-time nurses were recruited from 6 hospitals: 2 hospitals in Vietnam and 4 hospitals in Thailand. The primary outcome of this program was the severity of depression measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 items. Follow-up surveys were conducted to measure the change in depression severity at 3 months (July-August 2022) and at 6 months (October-November 2022) after baseline. Mixed modeling for repeated measures was used to test the effects of the intervention compared with the control for the follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 1203 nurses were included in this study: 602 in the intervention group and 601 in the control group. The follow-up rate at 3 and 6 months ranged from 85.7% (515/601) to 87.5% (527/602). The completion rate for the program was 68.1% (410/602). The group difference in depression was significant at the 3-month follow-up (coefficient=-0.92, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.18; P=.02) and nonsignificant at the 6-month follow-up (coefficient=-0.33, 95% CI -1.11 to 0.45; P=.41). The estimated effect sizes were -0.15 and -0.06 at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the smartphone-based iCBT program was effective in reducing depression at the 3-month follow-up among hospital nurses in Vietnam and Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effect size was small, and therefore, these results may not be clinically meaningful.

We reviewed research on computer-assisted cognitive behavior therapy (CCBT) and mobile mental health applications to assess the effectiveness of these methods of delivering or augmenting treatment, evaluating patient and provider uptake, and making recommendations on the clinical use of these tools in the treatment of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Research on CCBT has found solid evidence for efficacy when the use of a therapeutic computer program is supported by a clinician or other helping professional. Lower levels of efficacy have been found when CCBT is used as a stand-alone treatment. Current CCBT programs have many desirable features; however, few of the current programs incorporate services such as artificial intelligence that have the potential to help improve communication with patients. An increasing number of mobile apps have been created that claim to be useful for depression and/or anxiety, yet caution is warranted before using most due to limited research on effectiveness, low retention rates, and other issues like safety concerns. SUMMARY: Growth in the development of CCBT and mental health applications for depression/anxiety has provided several tools that could enhance treatment delivery. A large number of randomized, controlled trials have documented the effectiveness of CCBT, while research on mobile apps has been much less robust. The advantages and disadvantages of these digital technologies are identified, and recommendations are made for clinical use."

DESIGN: Parallel randomised controlled, open, trial. Participants were allocated using an online randomisation tool, handled by an independent person who was separate from the staff conducting the study. SETTING: General community, with recruitment nationally through mass media and advertisements. PARTICIPANTS: 40 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder received a BA treatment, and 41 participants received a mindfulness treatment. 9 participants were lost at the post-treatment. INTERVENTION BA: An 8-week long behaviour programme administered via a smartphone application. Mindfulness: An 8-week long mindfulness programme, administered via a smartphone application. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9). RESULTS: 81 participants were randomised (mean age 36.0 years (SD=10.8)) and analysed. Results showed no significant interaction effects of group and time on any of the outcome measures either from pretreatment to post-treatment or from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the BA treatment was more effective than the mindfulness treatment among participants with higher initial severity of depression from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up (PHQ-9: F (1, 362.1)=5.2, p<0.05). In contrast, the mindfulness treatment worked better than the BA treatment among participants with lower initial severity from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up (PHQ-9: F (1, 69.3)=7.7, p<0.01); BDI-II: (F(1, 53.60)=6.25, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The two interventions did not differ significantly from one another. For participants with higher severity of depression, the treatment based on BA was superior to the treatment based on mindfulness. For participants with lower initial severity, the treatment based on mindfulness worked significantly better than the treatment based on BA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials NCT01463020."

RESULTS: We enrolled 57 participants, 85% of eligible adults and 38% of all adults screened. We observed high levels of adherence in both digital monitoring (90%) and health coaching (92%); 88% of participants were retained. In linear mixed-effects models, depression symptoms significantly decreased, but the interaction between time and intervention was not significant. CONCLUSION: A behavioral intervention that uses both digital monitoring and motivational health coaching is feasible and acceptable to older bereaved adults."

However, there is currently no comprehensive way of measuring these skills in patients. OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive and brief measure of five main CBT skills: self-monitoring, behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, assertiveness training and problem-solving. METHODS: University students (N=847) who participated in a fully factorial randomised controlled trial of smartphone CBT were assessed with the CBT Skills Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the short form of the Japanese Big Five Scale. Structural validity was estimated with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and internal consistency evaluated with Cronbach's α coefficients. Construct validity was evaluated with the correlations between each factor of the CBT Skills Scale, the PHQ-9, the GAD-7 and the Big Five Scale. FINDINGS: The EFA supported a five-factor solution based on the original instruments assessing each CBT skill component. The CFA showed sufficient goodness-of-fit indices for the five-factor structure. The Cronbach's α of each factor was 0.75-0.81. Each CBT skills factor was specifically correlated to the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and the Big Five Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The CBT Skills Scale has a stable structural validity and internal consistency with a five-factor solution and appropriate content validity concerning the relationship with depression, anxiety and personality. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The CBT Skills Scale will be potential predictor and effect modifier in studying the optimisation of CBT interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTR-000031307."
10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243,An analysis on self-management and treatment-related functionality and characteristics of highly rated anxiety apps,"Drissi N, Ouhbi S, Janati Idrissi MA, Ghogho M.",Int J Med Inform,2020,2020.8.10,,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. METHOD: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. RESULTS: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic."
10.2196/23778,Comparing Effectiveness Between a Mobile App Program and Traditional Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Evaluation Study,"Hwang H, Bae S, Hong JS, Han DH.",JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021.1.19,,,"BACKGROUND: This study proposes a digital program for the treatment of mental illness that could increase motivation and improve learning outcomes for patients. Several studies have already applied this method by using an exposure and response prevention-inspired serious game to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program would be as effective in treating OCD as traditional offline CBT. In addition, the treatment efficacy in response to mobile CBT for OCD might be associated with increased brain activity within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) tract. METHODS: The digital CBT treatment program for OCD, OCfree, consists of 6 education sessions, 10 quests, and 7 casual games. Information was gathered from 27 patients with OCD (15 offline CBT and 12 OCfree CBT). During the 6-week intervention period, changes in clinical symptoms and brain function activity were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms between the two groups. However, the OCfree group showed greater improvement in anxiety symptoms compared to the offline CBT group. Both offline CBT and OCfree CBT increased the functional connectivity within the CSTC tract in all patients with OCD. However, CBT using OCfree showed greater changes in brain connectivity within the thalamus and insula, compared to offline CBT. CONCLUSIONS: OCfree, an OCD treatment app program, was effective in the treatment of drug-naïve patients with OCD. The treatment effects of OCfree are associated with increased brain connectivity within the CSTC tract. Multisensory stimulation by education, quests, and games in OCfree increases the activity within the thalamus and insula in patients with OCD."
10.1111/jsr.13932,The role of rumination in the relationship between symptoms of insomnia and depression in adolescents,"Li SH, Corkish B, Richardson C, Christensen H, Werner-Seidler A.",J Sleep Res,2024,2023.5.17,,,"There is a strong relationship between the symptoms of insomnia and depression, however, little is understood about the factors that mediate this relationship. An understanding of these underlying mechanisms may inform the advancement of existing treatments to optimise reductions in insomnia and depression when they co-occur. This study examined rumination and unhelpful beliefs about sleep as mediators between symptoms of insomnia and depression. It also evaluated the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on rumination and unhelpful beliefs about sleep, and whether these factors mediated the effect of CBT-I on depressive symptoms. A series of mediation analyses and linear mixed modelling were conducted on data from 264 adolescents (12-16 years) who participated in a two-arm (intervention vs. control) randomised controlled trial of Sleep Ninja®, a CBT-I smartphone app for adolescents. Rumination, but not unhelpful beliefs about sleep, was a significant mediator between symptoms of insomnia and depression at baseline. CBT-I led to reductions in unhelpful beliefs about sleep, but not in rumination. At the between-group level, neither rumination, nor unhelpful beliefs about sleep emerged as mechanisms underlying improvement in depression symptoms, however, rumination mediated within-subject improvements following CBT-I. The findings suggest rumination links symptoms of insomnia and depression and provide preliminary evidence that reductions in depression following CBT-I occurs via improvements in rumination. Targeting rumination may improve current therapeutic approaches."

Cognitive behavioral therapy delivered using smartphone technology is a novel approach for PICS-F symptom self-management. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of smartphone delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing the prevalence and severity of PICS-F symptoms in family members of critically ill patients. METHODS: The study had a randomized controlled longitudinal design with control and intervention groups composed of family members of patients admitted to 2 adult intensive care units. The intervention consisted of a mental health app loaded on participants' personal smartphones. The study time points were upon enrollment (within 5 days of intensive care unit admission; time 1), 30 days after enrollment (time 2), and 60 days after enrollment (time 3). Study measures included demographic data, PICS-F symptoms, mental health self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and app use. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 60 predominantly White (72%) and female (78%) family members (30 intervention, 30 control). Anxiety and depression symptom severity decreased significantly over time in the intervention group but not in the control group. Family members logged in to the app a mean of 11.4 times (range, 1-53 times) and spent a mean of 50.16 minutes (range, 1.87-245.92 minutes) using the app. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to family members of critically ill patients via a smartphone app shows some efficacy in reducing PICS-F symptoms."
10.1177/1357633X18794332,The effectiveness of telemedicine interventions to address maternal depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Nair U, Armfield NR, Chatfield MD, Edirippulige S.",J Telemed Telecare,2018,2018.10.23,,,"Comment in Mhealth. 2018 Dec 19;4:60. doi: 10.21037/mhealth.2018.12.04. Introduction Maternal depression (MD), is an overarching term for depression affecting pregnant women and mothers for up to 12 months postpartum. Because MD may have chronic and long-lasting effects, it is an important public health concern. The extent to which telemedicine may be an effective way to provide services to sufferers of MD is unknown, therefore, this review aimed to assess the available evidence. Methods We conducted a search of The Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for relevant randomised controlled trials published between 2000 and 2018; we then conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Results We identified 10 studies for inclusion. Therapeutic strategies involved cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural activation and other psychoeducation. Eight trials reported significant improvement in depression scores post-intervention; four studies that conducted post-intervention follow-up found that these improvements continued. However, high attrition rates and lack of blinding were common problems. Discussion This review found limited evidence supporting the delivery of CBT for the treatment of MD and anxiety using telemedicine. However, most of the evidence only studied improvements in postpartum depression, indicating that use of telemedicine to provide MD intervention is still small and an under-researched area."

The objectives of this literature review were to determine the extent to which research-validated iCBTs were available to the public, as well as to determine their therapeutic content. A literature review of RCTs for iCBTs was conducted on July 30, 2021. For each iCBT, interventions were rated by content and compared to commercially available smartphone apps. Our search yielded 80 studies using 41 unique iCBTs. Of these, only 6 (15%) were completely available to the public, more than half were not publicly available (46%), and the remaining 39% were available to the public with some restrictions (e.g., those based on the user's geographical location). When comparing iCBTs evaluated in RCTs to commercially available smartphone apps, we found that iCBTs were more likely to contain psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, problem solving, and interpersonal communication components. iCBTs from RCTs contain evidence-based content but few are available to the public. Extending beyond efficacy, attention should be paid to the dissemination of iCBTs."
10.1111/famp.12733,Mobile application for couple relationships: Results of a pilot effectiveness study,"Troitskaya O, Batkhina A.",Fam Process,2022,2021.12.14,,,"Mobile apps in mental health have seen a significant growth in recent years. Most of them are aimed at treating depression, anxiety, and stress disorders using cognitive behavioural therapy methods and relatively few apps are being developed to address interpersonal issues. This study tested the effectiveness of the iCognito Relationship Program, a self-help application for couple relationships based on the chatbot technology. A between-group experimental study was conducted in Russia using the bibliotherapy as a control condition (N = 58, female sample), with results showing that, after 2 weeks, iCognito's users had increased satisfaction, tenderness, constructive communication, as well as commitment to the relationship. Also, indicators for relationship self-efficacy, communicative skills in relationships, and self-esteem regarding relationship skills had significantly increased, while level of conflicts had decreased. A medium effect size was reported for most indicators. The participants of an experimental group expressed a high level of satisfaction with the technology and a generally positive attitude towards the idea of working with a ""virtual psychologist""-chatbot on their personal issues. Despite the need to reproduce the research results, iCognito program demonstrates that both mobile application and chatbot technologies can be useful for training individuals' relationship satisfaction and communication skills, and that they can be more efficient in increasing satisfaction and reducing conflict in relationships than self-help books. Publisher: En los últimos años, las aplicaciones móviles en la salud mental han crecido considerablemente. La mayoría están orientadas a tratar trastornos de depresión, ansiedad y estrés usando métodos de la terapia cognitivo-conductual, pero se están desarrollando relativamente pocas aplicaciones para abordar problemas interpersonales. En este estudio se evaluó la eficacia de la iCognito Relationship Program, una aplicación de autoayuda para las relaciones de pareja basada en la tecnología de bots de charla. Se realizó un estudio experimental intergrupal en Rusia usando la biblioterapia como condición de control (N = 58, muestra femenina), cuyos resultados demostraron que, después de 2 semanas, los usuarios de iCognito habían aumentado la satisfacción, la amabilidad, la comunicación constructiva y el compromiso con la relación. Además, los indicadores de la autoeficacia de la relación, las habilidades comunicativas en las relaciones y la autoestima con respecto a las habilidades relacionales habían aumentado significativamente, mientras que el nivel de conflictos había disminuido. Se informó un tamaño del efecto mediano para la mayoría de los indicadores. Los participantes de un grupo experimental expresaron un alto nivel de satisfacción con la tecnología y una actitud generalmente positiva hacia la idea de trabajar con un “psicólogo virtual” en un bot de charla sobre sus problemas personales. A pesar de la necesidad de reproducir los resultados de la investigación, el programa iCognito demuestra que tanto la aplicación móvil como las tecnologías de bot de charla pueden ser útiles para formar las habilidades de satisfacción con la relación y de comunicación de las personas, y que pueden ser más eficaces que los libros de autoayuda a la hora de aumentar la satisfacción y reducir el conflicto en las relaciones.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of mental health disorders in Canada is increasing with costs of CAD $51 billion (US $40 billion) per year. Depression is the most prevalent cause of disability while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best validated behavioral depression treatment. CBT, when combined with mindfulness meditation (CBT-M), has strong evidence for increased efficacy. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated online CBT-M efficacy, comparisons with in-office delivery are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to assess whether online group CBT-M (with standard psychiatric care) is non-inferior in efficacy and more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M at post-intervention and 6-months follow-up in major depressive disorder. The study will also assess whether digitally recorded data (ie, online workbooks completed, Fitbit step count, and online text messages) predict depression symptom reduction in online participants. METHODS: This single-center, two-arm, noninferiority RCT employs assessor-blinded and self-report outcomes and economic evaluation. The research site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto), a research-based psychiatry institution where participants will be identified from service wait lists and through contacts with other Toronto clinics. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) aged 18-60 years, any ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) of mild severity (score ≥14) with no upper severity limit; (3) Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-confirmed, psychiatric major depressive disorder diagnosis; (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed by staff psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) receipt of weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) observation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) criteria for severe alcohol or substance use disorder (in past 3 months), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia (or other primary psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder; (3) clinically significant suicidal ideation (imminent intent or attempted suicide in the past 6 months); and (4) treatment-resistant depression. All participants receive standard psychiatric care, experimental participants receive online group CBT-M, and controls receive standard care in-office group CBT-M. The online group program (in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc) combines smartphone and computer-accessed workbooks with mental health phone counselling (16 hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates software interactions (eg, secure text messaging and Fitbit-tracked walking). The primary outcome is BDI-II, and secondary outcomes are anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (ie, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), quality of life (European Quality of Life Five Dimension), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory). RESULTS: Based on prior studies with the BDI-II and 80% power to reject an inferiority hypothesis with a 1-sided type I error rate of 5%, a sample of 78 per group is adequate to detect small-to-medium-effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses online CBT-M efficacy and noninferiority in relation to in-person CBT, and the cost-effectiveness of both interventions.

10.2196/15418,Effectiveness of a Mobile App Intervention for Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,"McCloud T, Jones R, Lewis G, Bell V, Tsakanikos E.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020.8.1,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety symptoms are common among university students, but many do not receive treatment. This is often because of lack of availability, reluctance to seek help, and not meeting the diagnostic criteria required to access services. Internet-based interventions, including smartphone apps, can overcome these issues. However, a large number of apps are available, each with little evidence of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of a self-guided mobile app, Feel Stress Free, for the treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms in students. METHODS: A web-based randomized controlled trial compared a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app Feel Stress Free with a wait-list control. University students self-identified as experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression and were randomized to 6 weeks of intervention (n=84) or control (n=84), unblinded. The app is self-guided and incorporates behavioral relaxation activities, mood tracking and thought challenging, and minigames. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale online at baseline and every fortnight. RESULTS: At week 6, the primary end point, there was evidence that the Feel Stress Free app reduced depression symptoms (mean difference -1.56; 95% CI -2.67 to -0.44; P=.006) but only very weak evidence that it reduced anxiety symptoms (mean difference -1.36; 95% CI -2.93 to 0.21; P=.09). At week 4, there was evidence to support the effectiveness of the intervention for anxiety symptoms (mean difference -1.94; 95% CI -3.11 to -0.77; P=.001) and, though weaker, depression symptoms (mean difference -1.08; 95% CI -2.12 to -0.04; P=.04). At week 6, 83% (34/41) of participants indicated that they were using the app weekly or more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: The Feel Stress Free app is a promising mobile intervention for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in students and overcomes many of the barriers to traditional CBT. Further research is needed to establish its effectiveness at and beyond 6 weeks. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03032952; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03032952."
10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104440,Mobile app-based chatbot to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation for adults with attention deficit: A development and feasibility/usability study,"Jang S, Kim JJ, Kim SJ, Hong J, Kim S, Kim E.",Int J Med Inform,2021,2021.4.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Attention deficit is a growing problem in adults, and early diagnosis and treatment are needed. Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. METHODS: This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application ""Todaki,"" while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability, acceptability, and side effects. RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial."
10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055014,Acceptability and efficacy of the Zemedy app versus a relaxation training and meditation app for IBS: protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Hunt MG, Dalvie A, Ipek S, Wasman B.",BMJ Open,2022,2022.1.18,,,"INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, and impairs health-related quality of life (HRQL). Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for IBS, but access to treatment remains low. Our proposed solution is a CBT-based smartphone app, Zemedy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial of Zemedy (V.2.0) uses an education and relaxation training active control app meant to simulate treatment as usual. A target N of 300 participants complete baseline questionnaires and consent at screening, and are then allocated to either the immediate treatment (Zemedy) or the active control. Treatment lasts 8 weeks, after which both groups complete the same battery used at baseline, and the control group is crossed over to Zemedy. After another 8 weeks, the crossed-over participants will be surveyed once more. Follow-up questionnaires are administered at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Primary outcomes include gastrointestinal symptom severity and HRQL. Clinically significant change will be defined as post-treatment scores falling within 2 SD of the healthy mean. Analysis will include intent-to-treat between-groups comparisons, controlling for baseline symptom severity, as well as moderation and mediation analyses. We hypothesise that the Zemedy app will outperform the active control app in reducing IBS symptom severity and improving HRQL. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania. Results will provide essential information on the efficacy and acceptability of an app-based CBT treatment for IBS. The data gathered may help establish the Zemedy app as an empirically supported intervention for IBS and will assist funding bodies in deciding whether to invest in its further development and dissemination. The results will be disseminated to patients with IBS via the media and the company website, to healthcare professionals via professional training (e.g. webinars and grand rounds talks) and to researchers via conferences and publications.

The Screening and Treatment for Anxiety and Depression (STAND) system of care was developed to meet this need through the use of internet-connected devices for assessment and provision of treatment. STAND triages to level of care (monitoring only, digital therapy with coaches, digital therapy assisted by clinicians in training, and clinical care) and then continuously monitors symptoms to adapt level of care. Triaging and adaptation are based on symptom severity and suicide risk scores obtained from computerized adaptive testing administered remotely. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses how the STAND system of care improves upon current clinical paradigms, and presents preliminary data on feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of STAND in a sample of US-based university students. METHODS: US-based university students were recruited and enrolled in an open trial of the STAND system of care. Participants were triaged based on initial symptom severity derived from a computerized adaptive test and monitored over 40 weeks on anxiety, depression, and suicide risk to inform treatment adaptation and evaluate preliminary effectiveness. RESULTS: Nearly 5000 students were screened and 516 received care. Depression and anxiety severity scores improved across all tiers (P<.001 in all cases). Suicide risk severity improved in the highest tier (ie, clinical care; P<.001). Acceptability and feasibility were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: STAND is a feasible and acceptable model of care that can reach large numbers of individuals. STAND showed preliminary effectiveness on all primary outcome measures. Current directions to improve STAND are described."

Prior studies have used technology to bridge barriers but have been unable to extensively assess the impact of the digital therapeutic on real-world patient experience and multidimensional outcomes. Among patients with insomnia, our aim is to determine the impact of a prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) (PEAR-003b, FDA-authorised as Somryst; herein called PDT) that provides mobile-delivered CBT-I on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and healthcare utilisation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a pragmatically designed, prospective, multicentre randomised controlled trial that leverages Hugo, a unique patient-centred health data-aggregating platform for data collection and patient follow-up from Hugo Health. A total of 100 participants with insomnia from two health centres will be enrolled onto the Hugo Health platform, provided with a linked Fitbit (Inspire 2) to track activity and then randomised 1:1 to receive (or not) the PDT for mobile-delivered CBT-I (Somryst). The primary outcome is a change in the insomnia severity index score from baseline to 9-week postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilisation, health utility scores and clinical outcomes; change in sleep outcomes as measured with sleep diaries and a change in individual PROs including depressive symptoms, daytime sleepiness, health status, stress and anxiety. For those allocated to the PDT, we will also assess engagement with the PDT. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Boards at Yale University and the Mayo Clinic have approved the trial protocol. This trial will provide important data to patients, clinicians and policymakers about the impact of the PDT device delivering CBT-I on PROs, clinical outcomes and healthcare utilisation. Findings will be disseminated to participants, presented at professional meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04909229."
10.2196/13728,A Behavioral Activation Mobile Health App for Smokers With Depression: Development and Pilot Evaluation in a Single-Arm Trial,"Heffner JL, Watson NL, Serfozo E, Mull KE, MacPherson L, Gasser M, Bricker JB.",JMIR Form Res,2019,2019.11.28,,,"BACKGROUND: The integration of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BAT-D) into smoking cessation interventions is a promising approach to address depression as a barrier to quitting. However, this approach has only been tested as a face-to-face intervention, which has low reach. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to develop a BAT-D mobile health app with high potential reach and determine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects on theory-based behavioral processes of behavioral activation, reduced depressive symptoms, and smoking cessation. METHODS: Following a user-centered design process consisting of competitive analysis, focus groups, and prototype testing, we conducted a single-arm pilot trial of Actify!, a BAT-D app for depressed smokers. Participants used SmokefreeTXT along with Actify! to provide cessation content that had not yet been built into the app for this initial phase of pilot testing. Participants in the trial were current, daily smokers with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. We examined use outcomes for all enrolled participants and process and cessation outcomes at 6 weeks postenrollment for study completers (16/17, 94% retention). RESULTS: Regarding acceptability, average number of log-ins per participant was 16.6 (SD 13.7), and 63% (10/16) reported being satisfied overall with the app. Posttreatment interviews identified some usability challenges (eg, high perceived burden of planning and scheduling values-based activities). There was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up (mean change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores was -4.5, 95% CI -7.7 to -1.3; P=.01). Additionally, carbon monoxide (CO)-confirmed, 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 6-week follow-up was 31% (5/16), and the 30-day PPA was 19% (3/16). CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate promising engagement with Actify! and potential for impact on theory-based change processes and cessation outcomes. Preliminary quit rates compare favorably to previous trials of smoking cessation apps for the general population (ie, short-term, self-reported 30-day quit rates in the 8% to 18% range) and a previous trial of face-to-face BAT-D for depressed smokers (ie, CO-confirmed, 7-day PPA rate of 17% at end of treatment)."

A novel way to reduce depression is by improving sleep. We evaluated whether an app-based intervention for insomnia improved sleep and depression, and whether changes in insomnia mediated changes in depression. METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm single-blind randomised controlled trial at the Black Dog Institute in Australia. Adolescents 12-16 years experiencing insomnia symptoms were randomly allocated to receive Sleep Ninja, an app-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy program for insomnia, or to an active control group involving weekly text message sleep tips. Assessments took place at baseline, 6 weeks (post-intervention) and 14 weeks (post-baseline). Co-primary outcomes were symptoms of insomnia and depression at post-intervention (primary endpoint). Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12619001462178. RESULTS: Between October 25, 2019, and September 6, 2020, 264 participants were randomised to receive Sleep Ninja (n = 131) or to the control group (n = 133). Relative to the control group, those allocated to the intervention reported a greater reduction in insomnia symptoms at 6 weeks (95% CI: -2.96 to -0.41, d = .41) and 14 weeks (95% CI: -3.34 to -0.19, d = .39), and a greater reduction in depression symptoms at 6 weeks (95% CI: -3.46 to -0.56, d = .28) but not 14 weeks (p < 1). Change in insomnia mediated change in depression. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: An app-delivered program for insomnia could be a practical, non-stigmatising and scalable way to reduce symptoms of insomnia and depression among adolescents experiencing difficulties getting enough good quality sleep."

However, the specific iCBT components that contribute to its effectiveness remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the effects of iCBT components in preventing depression among university students. METHODS: Using a smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app, we randomly allocated university students to the presence or absence of 5 different iCBT components: self-monitoring, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, assertiveness training, and problem-solving. The active intervention lasted 8 weeks but the app remained accessible through the follow-up. The primary outcome was the onset of a major depressive episode (MDE) between baseline and the follow-up after 52 weeks, as assessed with the computerized World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Secondary outcomes included changes in the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item General Anxiety Disorder, and CBT Skills Scale. RESULTS: During the 12-month follow-up, 133 of 1301 (10.22%) participants reported the onset of an MDE. There were no significant differences in the incidence of MDEs between the groups with or without each component (hazard ratios ranged from 0.85, 95% CI 0.60-1.20, for assertiveness training to 1.26, 95% CI 0.88-1.79, for self-monitoring). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the changes on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item General Anxiety Disorder, or for CBT Skills Scale between component allocation groups. However, significant reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed among all participants at the 52-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we could not identify any specific iCBT components that were effective in preventing depression or the acquisition of CBT skills over the 12-month follow-up period, but all participants with and without intervention of each iCBT component demonstrated significant improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Further research is needed to explore the potential impact of frequency of psychological assessments, nonspecific intervention effects, natural change in the mental state, and the baseline depression level."
10.2196/32007,Examining the Theoretical Framework of Behavioral Activation for Major Depressive Disorder: Smartphone-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment Study,"van Genugten CR, Schuurmans J, Hoogendoorn AW, Araya R, Andersson G, Baños R, Botella C, Cerga Pashoja A, Cieslak R, Ebert DD, García-Palacios A, Hazo JB, Herrero R, Holtzmann J, Kemmeren L, Kleiboer A, Krieger T, Smoktunowicz E, Titzler I, Topooco N, Urech A, Smit JH, Riper H.",JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021.12.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA), either as a stand-alone treatment or as part of cognitive behavioral therapy, has been shown to be effective for treating depression. The theoretical underpinnings of BA derive from Lewinsohn et al's theory of depression. The central premise of BA is that having patients engage in more pleasant activities leads to them experiencing more pleasure and elevates their mood, which, in turn, leads to further (behavioral) activation. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence about the theoretical framework of BA. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the assumed (temporal) associations of the 3 constructs in the theoretical framework of BA. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the ""European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Internet-based Depression Treatment versus treatment-as-usual"" trial among patients who were randomly assigned to receive blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT). As part of bCBT, patients completed weekly assessments of their level of engagement in pleasant activities, the pleasure they experienced as a result of these activities, and their mood over the course of the treatment using a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) application. Longitudinal cross-lagged and cross-sectional associations of 240 patients were examined using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. RESULTS: The analyses did not reveal any statistically significant cross-lagged coefficients (all P>.05). Statistically significant cross-sectional positive associations between activities, pleasure, and mood levels were identified. Moreover, the levels of engagement in activities, pleasure, and mood slightly increased over the duration of the treatment. In addition, mood seemed to carry over, over time, while both levels of engagement in activities and pleasurable experiences did not. CONCLUSIONS: The results were partially in accordance with the theoretical framework of BA, insofar as the analyses revealed cross-sectional relationships between levels of engagement in activities, pleasurable experiences deriving from these activities, and enhanced mood. However, given that no statistically significant temporal relationships were revealed, no conclusions could be drawn about potential causality. A shorter measurement interval (eg, daily rather than weekly EMA reports) might be more attuned to detecting potential underlying temporal pathways. Future research should use an EMA methodology to further investigate temporal associations, based on theory and how treatments are presented to patients.

10.2196/51422,Behavioral Mechanisms That Mediate Mental and Physical Health Improvements in People With Chronic Pain Who Receive a Digital Health Intervention: Prospective Cohort Pilot Study,"Cheng AL, Agarwal M, Armbrecht MA, Abraham J, Calfee RP, Goss CW.",JMIR Form Res,2023,2023.11.17,,,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that digital mental health intervention (Wysa for Chronic Pain) can improve mental and physical health in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain and coexisting symptoms of depression or anxiety. However, the behavioral mechanisms through which this intervention acts are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify behavioral mechanisms that may mediate changes in mental and physical health associated with use of Wysa for Chronic Pain during orthopedic management of chronic musculoskeletal pain. We hypothesized that improved behavioral activation, pain acceptance, and sleep quality mediate improvements in self-reported mental and physical health. METHODS: In this prospective cohort, pilot mediation analysis, adults with chronic (≥3 months) neck or back pain received the Wysa for Chronic Pain digital intervention, which uses a conversational agent and text-based access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and related therapeutic content. Patient-reported outcomes and proposed mediators were collected at baseline and 1 month. The exposure of interest was participants' engagement (ie, total interactions) with the digital intervention. Proposed mediators were assessed using the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form, Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, and Athens Insomnia Scale. Outcomes included Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety, Depression, Pain Interference, and Physical Function scores. A mediation analysis was conducted using the Baron and Kenny method, adjusting for age, sex, and baseline mediators and outcome values. P<.20 was considered significant for this pilot study. RESULTS: Among 30 patients (mean age 59, SD 14, years; 21 [70%] female), the mediation effect of behavioral activation on the relationship between increased intervention engagement and improved anxiety symptoms met predefined statistical significance thresholds (indirect effect -0.4, 80% CI -0.7 to -0.1; P=.13, 45% of the total effect). The direction of mediation effect was generally consistent with our hypothesis for all other proposed mediator or outcome relationships, as well. CONCLUSIONS: In a full-sized randomized controlled trial of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, behavioral activation, pain acceptance, and sleep quality may play an important role in mediating the relationship between use of a digital mental health intervention (Wysa for Chronic Pain) and improved mental and physical health.

10.2196/mhealth.4231,MoodHacker Mobile Web App With Email for Adults to Self-Manage Mild-to-Moderate Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Birney AJ, Gunn R, Russell JK, Ary DV.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2016,2016.1.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US $210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50% of these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated through new channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge of depression, and functioning in the workplace. METHODS: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression. Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and with outreach through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization, all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms. RESULTS: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on depression symptoms, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these outcome measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression symptoms (partial eta(2) = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access to relevant depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts to maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person support.

10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.028,Evaluation of chatbot-delivered interventions for self-management of depression: Content analysis,"Martinengo L, Lum E, Car J.",J Affect Disord,2022,2022.9.23,,,"BACKGROUND: Conversational agents (CAs) or chatbots are increasingly used for depression, anxiety, and wellbeing management. CAs are considered acceptable and helpful. However, little is known about the adequacy of CA responses. This study assessed the structure, content, and user-customization of mental health CA dialogues with users with depression or at risk of suicide. METHODS: We used content analysis to examine the dialogues of CAs previously included in three assessments of mental health apps (depression education, self-guided cognitive behavioural therapy, and suicide prevention) performed between 2019 and 2020. Two standardized user personas with depression were developed to interact with the CA. All conversations were saved as screenshots, transcribed verbatim, and coded inductively. RESULTS: Nine CAs were included. Seven CAs (78%) had Android and iOS versions; five CAs (56%) had at least 500,000 downloads. The analysis generated eight categories: self-introduction, personalization, appropriateness of CA responses, conveying empathy, guiding users through mood-boosting activities, mood monitoring, suicide risk management, and others. CAs could engage in empathic, non-judgemental conversations with users, offer support, and guide psychotherapeutic exercises. LIMITATIONS: CA evaluations were performed using standardized personas, not real-world users. CAs were included for evaluation only if retrieved in the search strategies associated with the previous assessment studies. CONCLUSION: Assessed CAs offered anonymous, empathic, non-judgemental interactions that align with evidence for face-to-face psychotherapy. CAs from app stores are not suited to provide comprehensive suicide risk management. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of CA-led interventions in mental health care and in enhancing suicide risk management strategies."
10.2196/45970,Barriers to and Facilitators of a Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for Depression and Anxiety Based on Experiences of University Students: Qualitative Interview Study,"Braun P, Atik E, Guthardt L, Apolinário-Hagen J, Schückes M.",JMIR Form Res,2023,2023.4.12,,,"BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) programs have been proposed to increase the acceptance and adoption of digital therapeutics (DTx) such as digital health apps. These programs allow for more personalized care by combining regular face-to-face therapy sessions with DTx. However, facilitators of and barriers to the use of DTx in bCBT programs have rarely been examined among students, who are particularly at risk for developing symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the facilitators of and barriers to the use of a bCBT program with the elona therapy app among university students with mild to moderate depression or anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted via videoconference between January 2022 and April 2022 with 102 students (mean age 23.93, SD 3.63 years; 89/102, 87.2% female) from universities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, after they had completed weekly individual cognitive behavioral therapy sessions (25 minutes each) via videoconference for 6 weeks and regularly used the depression (n=67, 65.7%) or anxiety (n=35, 34.3%) module of the app. The interviews were coded based on grounded theory. RESULTS: Many participants highlighted the intuitive handling of the app and indicated that they perceived it as a supportive tool between face-to-face sessions. Participants listed other benefits, such as increased self-reflection and disorder-specific knowledge as well as the transfer of the content of therapy sessions into their daily lives. Some stated that they would have benefited from more personalized and interactive tasks. In general, participants mentioned the time requirement, increased use of the smartphone, and the feeling of being left alone with potentially arising emotions while working on tasks for the next therapy session as possible barriers to the use of the app. Data security was not considered a major concern. CONCLUSIONS: Students mostly had positive attitudes toward elona therapy as part of the bCBT program. Our study shows that DTx complementing face-to-face therapy sessions can be perceived as a helpful tool for university students with mild to moderate anxiety or depression symptoms in their daily lives. Future research could elaborate on whether bCBT programs might also be suitable for students with more severe symptoms of mental disorders. In addition, the methods by which such bCBT programs could be incorporated into the university context to reach students in need of psychological support should be explored."
10.2196/39052,Effectiveness of an App-Based Short Intervention to Improve Sleep: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Vollert B, Müller L, Jacobi C, Trockel M, Beintner I.",JMIR Ment Health,2023,2023.3.21,,,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence for digital interventions to improve sleep shows promising effects. The interventions investigated so far have been primarily web-based; however, app-based interventions may reach a wider audience and be more suitable for daily use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the intervention effects, adherence, and acceptance of an unguided app-based intervention for individuals who wish to improve their sleep. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an app-based short intervention (Refresh) to improve sleep compared with a waitlist condition. Refresh is an 8-week unguided intervention covering the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and including a sleep diary. The primary outcome was sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) as self-assessed by the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS). The secondary outcomes were depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score) and perceived insomnia-related impairment. RESULTS: We included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at baseline. About 1 in 3 participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention. Active participants completed on average 4 out of 8 chapters. Retention rates were 67.4% (n=250) at postassessment and 57.7% (n=214) at the 6-month follow-up. At postintervention, insomnia symptoms in the intervention group had improved more than those in the waitlist group, with a small effect (d=0.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=0.45) in the subgroup with poor sleep. Effects in the intervention group were maintained at follow-up. Perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre- to postassessment. No significant intervention effect on depression was detected. Working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good. CONCLUSIONS: An app-based, unguided intervention is a feasible and effective option to scale-up CBT-I-based treatment, but intervention uptake and adherence need to be carefully addressed.

10.3233/WOR-211406,Effects of a mobile health intervention on activities of stress self-management for workers,Lee YJ.,Work,2023,2023.1.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions are being widely tried because of their attractive advantages. However, there is not enough evidence for its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of mobile app-based stress management intervention (mSMI) on highly stressed workers. METHODS: A sample of 82 white-collar workers with elevated symptoms of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10≥22) were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The mSMI consisted of three modules: self-management including a work diary, counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy and interventions focused on music, meditation, relaxation and image healings. Self-report data were collected at the baseline and post-intervention. Study outcomes analyzed perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and work engagement. Data were assessed using analysis of covariance with covariates. RESULTS: There was significantly reduced perceived stress from baseline to 6 weeks in mSMI (t = 5.788, p < 0.001) and control group (t = 3.184, p = 0.003). After adjusting for covariates, the between-group difference in the perceived stress was significantly different (F = 4.051, p = 0.048); however, the effect size was small. There was no significant intervention effect on anxiety, depression, and work engagement. The process evaluation indicated that most participants (85.3%) were satisfied with the intervention and their mental health benefited. CONCLUSION: This study found that mobile health intervention facilitated perceived stress management for highly stressed workers. Further studies should address job-related outcomes and mental health symptoms in workers by applying the latest information technology and addressing the limitations of mobile interventions."

Telemedicine-based interventions using text messaging are currently being trialled for the management of community-based clients with clinical depression. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such methods. METHODS: We searched the databases PubMed, Embase, Informit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and Scopus for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and April 2019. Studies comparing text messaging interventions to a comparator group for patients with depression were included in the review. Articles were assessed for quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for RCTs. RESULTS: Nine RCTs (945 patients: 764 adults and 181 adolescents) were included in the systematic review. Five studies used text messaging as the only intervention, whilst the remaining combined text messaging with other treatment modalities such as behavioural activation or cognitive behavioural therapy. A meta-analysis was conducted on seven selected RCTs (845 patients: 664 adults and 181 adolescents). The standardised mean reduction in depression due to text messaging interventions was 0.23 (95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.48). There was evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect between studies. DISCUSSION: There is marginal evidence supporting text messaging interventions as an effective treatment modality for people living with clinical depression. However, further research is needed to determine how best to utilise text-message interventions alongside other conventional forms of health services delivery."

Written exposure therapy (WET), a brief 5-session treatment, has been found to be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms, but no studies have examined it in an Eastern context. Mindfulness-based meditation mobile application may be a promising approach to reduce insomnia comorbid with PTSD. The current study aims to: 1) examine the effectiveness of WET for Chinese PTSD and subthreshold PTSD patients, and 2) examine the effectiveness of adding a mindfulness-based application (MBA) to WET for reducing comorbid insomnia. METHODS: The randomized controlled trial will enroll 150 adults with subthreshold/full PTSD and comorbid insomnia. Participants will be randomly assigned to written exposure therapy plus mindfulness-based application condition (WET + MBA, n = 50), written exposure therapy alone (WET, n = 50), or minimal contact control (MMC, n = 50). Clinical interview of the primary outcome (PTSD symptoms) will be administrated at baseline, posttreatment, 3- and 6- month follow-up, while self-reported PTSD symptoms and secondary outcomes (insomnia severity) will be administrated at baseline, every week and all follow-ups. DISCUSSION: This is the first study applying WET in Chinese PTSD patients, as well as examining a mindfulness-based mobile application as a treatment add-on for comorbid insomnia. Study findings will contribute to the knowledge of the effectiveness of WET and a mindfulness-based mobile application, and the development of a culture-adapted treatment protocol.

Smartphone-based interventions may be a low-cost treatment method. Method: College students with self-reported GAD were randomized to receive smartphone-based guided self-help (n = 50), or no treatment (n = 50). Post-treatment and six-month follow-up outcomes included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-Short Form Stress Subscale (DASS Stress), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ-11), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T), as well as diagnostic status assessed by the GAD-Questionnaire, 4th edition. Results: From pre- to post-treatment, participants who received guided self-help (vs. no treatment) experienced significantly greater reductions on the DASS Stress (d = -0.408) and a greater probability of remission from GAD (d = -0.445). There was no significant between-group difference in change on the PSWQ-11 (d = -0.208) or STAI-T (d = -0.114). From post to six-month follow-up there was no significant loss of gains on DASS Stress scores (d = -0.141) and of those who had remitted, 78.6% remained remitted. Yet rates of remitted participants no longer differed significantly between conditions at follow-up (d = -0.229).

First-line treatments include antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT). However, several patients present treatment-resistance and/or adverse effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive neuromodulation technique, is an effective alternative for MDD. AREAS COVERED: We hereby review a portable tDCS device designed to be combined with a cognitive-behavioral intervention. This home-use device was developed by Flow Neuroscience™ and was recently approved in the UK and European Union. We discuss present evidence on tDCS efficacy and safety, both as a monotherapy and as a combined treatment. Moreover, we show a computer modeling tDCS procedure based on Flow parameters and montage. EXPERT OPINION: Electric field simulations revealed that Flow's tDCS device targets prefrontal cortical areas involved in MDD pathophysiology. In addition, the safety and efficacy profile revealed from prior tDCS studies support its use in depression. Finally, combining tDCS with cognitive-behavioral interventions might further enhance overall efficacy, although this aspect should be investigated in upcoming randomized, placebo-controlled trials."
10.1186/s13063-023-07168-5,Evaluation of a smartphone application for self-help for patients with social anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled study-SMASH,"Schittenhelm JM, von Borell C, Clément C, Schüller J, Stangier U, Hoyer J.",Trials,2023,2023.3.1,,,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is as effective as a stand-alone treatment and helps facilitating access to treatment. Given the complexity of the treatment, we argue that the effect of ICBT could be even greater if guided by a therapist, as this could increase treatment adherence. We modified an established and well-evaluated treatment approach and developed a mobile application for treating social anxiety disorder (SAD). In the present study, we compare the efficacy of app use alone (APP) with video-based, therapist-guided app use (TG-APP) and with a wait-list control group (WLC) in terms of symptom reduction, and various secondary outcomes such as increase in quality of life or decrease of general psychological distress. METHODS/DESIGN: A within-between interaction design with randomization to one of three conditions will be used. In the APP condition, patients receive only the app without any additional contact with therapists, while in the TG-APP condition, therapists provide 8 sessions of video-based treatment in addition to using the app. The study will be conducted in two university outpatient treatment centers with reliably diagnosed SAD patients. The primary outcome will be defined as change in SAD symptoms, as measured by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (expert rating). Furthermore, a wide range of self-reports and clinician ratings for other symptoms (depression, general psychopathology) or quality of life will be used. A simulation-based power analysis for a 3 × 2 interaction effect (group × time) on the primary outcome in a linear mixed model resulted in a total sample size of N = 165. DISCUSSION: The present study will be one of the first to examine the additional benefit of therapist-guided video sessions regarding the use of an app treating SAD. Study results are pivotal to future treatment application in SAD."

Various studies have demonstrated their association with clinical and psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, aggression, anger expression, and behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation systems. However, these two addictions are also highly correlated with each other, so the consideration of the relationship between internet and smartphone addiction can enhance the analysis. In this study, we considered the copula regression model to regress the bivariate addictions on clinical and psychological factors. Real data analysis with 555 students (age range: 14-15 years; males, N = 295; females, N = 265) from South Korean public middle schools is illustrated. By fitting the copula regression model, we investigated the dependency between internet and smartphone addiction and determined the risk factors associated with the two addictions. Furthermore, by comparing the model fits of the copula model with linear regression and generalized linear models, the best copula model was proposed in terms of goodness of fit. Our findings revealed that internet and smartphone addiction are not separate problems, and that associations between them should be considered. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, the behavioral inhibition system, and aggression were also significantly associated with both addictions, while ADHD symptoms were related to internet addiction only. We emphasize the need to establish policies on the prevention, management, and education of addiction."
10.2196/32199,Examining the Effectiveness of Gamification in Mental Health Apps for Depression: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Six SG, Byrne KA, Tibbett TP, Pericot-Valverde I.",JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021.11.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Previous research showed that computerized cognitive behavioral therapy can effectively reduce depressive symptoms. Some mental health apps incorporate gamification into their app design, yet it is unclear whether features differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms over and above mental health apps without gamification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether mental health apps with gamification elements differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms when compared to those that lack these elements. METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of app-based therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness, on depressive symptoms was performed. A total of 5597 articles were identified via five databases. After screening, 38 studies (n=8110 participants) remained for data extraction. From these studies, 50 total comparisons between postintervention mental health app intervention groups and control groups were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A random effects model was performed to examine the effect of mental health apps on depressive symptoms compared to controls. The number of gamification elements within the apps was included as a moderator. Results indicated a small to moderate effect size across all mental health apps in which the mental health app intervention effectively reduced depressive symptoms compared to controls (Hedges g=-0.27, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.17; P<.001). The gamification moderator was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms (β=-0.03, SE=0.03; P=.38), demonstrating no significant difference in effectiveness between mental health apps with and without gamification features. A separate meta-regression also did not show an effect of gamification elements on intervention adherence (β=-1.93, SE=2.28; P=.40). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that both mental health apps with and without gamification elements were effective in reducing depressive symptoms. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of mental health apps with gamification elements on depressive symptoms or adherence. This research has important clinical implications for understanding how gamification elements influence the effectiveness of mental health apps on depressive symptoms."

The co-occurrence of these disorders adds to the complexity of finding utility in as well as adherence to a treatment option. Digital therapeutic solutions may present a promising alternative treatment option that could mitigate these challenges and alleviate symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate (1) the feasibility and acceptance of a digital mental health intervention, (2) participants' engagement and retention levels, and (3) the potential efficacy with respect to anxiety and depression symptoms in a population with ADHD. Our main hypothesis was that a digital, data-driven, and personalized intervention for adults with coexisting ADHD and depressive or anxiety symptoms would show high engagement and adherence, which would be accompanied by a decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms along with an increase in quality of life and life satisfaction levels. METHODS: This real-world data, single-arm study included 30 adult participants with ADHD symptomatology and coexisting depressive or anxiety symptoms who joined a 16-week digital, data-driven mental health support program. This intervention is based on a combination of evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and positive psychology techniques. The targeted symptomatology was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV. Quality of life aspects were evaluated using the Satisfaction With Life Scale and the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire, and user feedback surveys were used to assess user experience and acceptability. RESULTS: The study retention rate was 97% (29/30), and high engagement levels were observed, as depicted by the 69 minutes spent on the app per week, 5 emotion logs per week, and 11.5 mental health actions per week. An average decrease of 46.2% (P<.001; r=0.89) in depressive symptoms and 46.4% (P<.001; r=0.86) in anxiety symptoms was observed, with clinically significant improvement for more than half (17/30, 57% and 18/30, 60%, respectively) of the participants. This was followed by an average increase of 23% (P<.001; r=0.78) and 20% (P=.003; r=0.8) in Satisfaction With Life Scale and Life Satisfaction Questionnaire scores, respectively. The overall participant satisfaction level was 4.3 out of 5. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and value of the examined digital program for adults with ADHD symptomatology to address the coexisting depressive or anxiety symptoms. However, controlled trials with larger sample sizes and more diverse participant profiles are required to provide further evidence of clinical efficacy."
10.2196/30813,Smartphone Delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Postintensive Care Syndrome-Family: Protocol for a Pilot Study,"Petrinec AB, Hughes JW, Zullo MD, Wilk C, George RL.",JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021.8.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Family members of critically ill patients experience symptoms of postintensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F), including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Postintensive care syndrome-family reduces the quality of life of the families of critically ill patients and may impede the recovery of such patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy has become a first-line nonpharmacological treatment of many psychological symptoms and disorders, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. With regard to managing mild-to-moderate symptoms, the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy via mobile technology without input from a clinician has been found to be feasible and well accepted, and its efficacy rivals that of face-to-face therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our pilot study is to examine the efficacy of using a smartphone mobile health (mHealth) app to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and diminish the severity and prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in family members of critically ill patients. METHODS: For our pilot study, 60 family members of critically ill patients will be recruited. A repeated-measures longitudinal study design that involves the randomization of participants to 2 groups (the control and intervention groups) will be used. The intervention group will receive cognitive behavioral therapy, which will be delivered via a smartphone mHealth app. Bandura's social cognitive theory and an emphasis on mental health self-efficacy form the theoretical framework of the study. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in August 2020. Data collection and analysis are expected to be completed by March 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study represents a novel approach to the treatment of PICS-F symptoms and is an extension of previous work conducted by the research team. The study will be used to plan a fully powered randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04316767; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04316767.

However, little is known about their effects on suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). Information on the impact of digital interventions on STB are essential for patients' safety because most digital interventions are self-help interventions without direct support options in case of a suicidal crisis. Therefore, we aim to conduct a meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPDMA) to investigate the effects of i-CBT interventions for depression on STB and to explore potential effect moderators. METHODS: Data will be retrieved from an established and annually updated IPD database of randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of i-CBT interventions for depression in adults and adolescents. We will conduct a one-stage and a two-stage IPDMA on the effects of these interventions on STB. All types of control conditions are eligible. STB can be measured using specific scales (e.g., Beck scale suicide, BSS) or single items from depression scales (e.g., item 9 of the PHQ-9) or standardized clinical interviews. Multilevel linear regression will be used for specific scales, and multilevel logistic regression will be used for treatment response or deterioration, operationalized as a change in score by at least one quartile from baseline. Exploratory moderator analyses will be conducted at participant, study, and intervention level. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. CONCLUSION: This IPDMA will harness the available data to assess the effects (response and deterioration) of i-CBT interventions for depression interventions on STB. Information about changes in STB is essential to estimate patients' safety when engaging in digital treatment formats. TRIAL REGISTRATION: We will pre-register this study with the open science framework after article acceptance to ensure consistency between online registration and the published trial protocol."
10.2196/29154,A Smartphone-Based Intervention as an Adjunct to Standard-of-Care Treatment for Schizophrenia: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Ghaemi SN, Sverdlov O, van Dam J, Campellone T, Gerwien R.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.3.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications have limited benefits in schizophrenia, and cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial as an adjunct. There may be potential for implementing mobile cognitive behavioral therapy-based treatment for schizophrenia in addition to standard antipsychotic medications. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether PEAR-004, a smartphone-based investigational digital therapeutic, improves the symptoms of an acute psychotic exacerbation of schizophrenia when it is added to standard treatments. METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, rater-blinded, parallel group proof‑of‑concept study of 112 participants with moderate acute psychotic exacerbation in schizophrenia. This study was conducted in 6 clinical trial research sites in the United States from December 2018 to September 2019. The primary outcome, change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to week 12 or the last available visit, was analyzed using the mixed-effects regression model for repeated measures, applied to an intent-to-treat sample. RESULTS: The total PANSS scores slightly decreased from baseline over the study period in both groups; the treatment difference at day 85 between PEAR-004 and sham was 2.7 points, in favor of the sham (2-sided P=.09). The secondary scales found no benefit, except for transient improvement in depressive symptoms with PEAR-004. Application engagement was good, and patient and clinical investigator satisfaction was high. No safety concerns were observed. There was some evidence of study site heterogeneity for the onboarding processes and directions on PEAR-004 product use at baseline and throughout the study. However, these differences did not affect the efficacy results. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest-to-date randomized, sham-controlled study of a digital therapeutic in schizophrenia, PEAR-004 did not demonstrate an effect on the primary outcome-total PANSS scores-when compared with a nonspecific digital sham control. The secondary and exploratory results also did not demonstrate any notable benefits, except for possible temporary improvement in depressive symptoms. This study provided many useful scientific and operational insights that can be used in the further clinical development of PEAR-004 and other investigational digital therapeutics.

This is because such knowledge can be helpful in the design of behavioral interventions aimed to improve self-efficacy, reduce depressive symptoms, and improve performance of self-care activities in CVD patients. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate if internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) improves self-efficacy and explore the relationships among changes in depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and physical activity, as well as the influence of iCBT on these relationships. METHODS: This study received funding in January 2015. Participant recruitment took place between January 2017 and February 2018, and the main findings were published in 2019. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized controlled study evaluating the effects of a 9-week iCBT program compared to an online discussion forum (ODF) on depressive symptoms in patients with CVD (N=144). Data were collected at baseline and at the 9-week follow-up. Analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the differences in self-efficacy between the iCBT and ODF groups. Structural equation modeling explored the relationships among changes in depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and physical activity, as well as the influence of iCBT on these relationships. RESULTS: At follow-up, a significant difference in the increase in self-efficacy favoring iCBT was found (P=.04, Cohen d=0.27). We found an indirect association between changes in depressive symptoms and physical activity (β=-.24, P<.01), with the change in self-efficacy acting as a mediator. iCBT had a direct effect on the changes in depressive symptoms, which in turn influenced the changes in self-efficacy (β=.23, P<.001) and physical activity (β=.12, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy was improved by iCBT. However, the influence of iCBT on self-efficacy and physical activity was mostly mediated by improvements in depressive symptoms.

10.1111/jsr.13140,Insomnia as a mediating therapeutic target for depressive symptoms: A sub-analysis of participant data from two large randomized controlled trials of a digital sleep intervention,"Henry AL, Miller CB, Emsley R, Sheaves B, Freeman D, Luik AI, Littlewood DL, Saunders KEA, Kanady JC, Carl JR, Davis ML, Kyle SD, Espie CA.",J Sleep Res,2021,2020.8.19,,,"Insomnia predicts the onset of depression, commonly co-presents with depression and often persists following depression remission. However, these conditions can be challenging to treat concurrently using depression-specific therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia may be an appropriate treatment to improve both insomnia and depressive symptoms. We examined the effects of a fully-automated digital cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for insomnia (Sleepio) on insomnia and depressive symptoms, and the mediating role of sleep improvement on depressive symptoms in participants from two randomized controlled trials of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. We also explored potential moderators of intervention effects. All participants met criteria for probable insomnia disorder and had clinically significant depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 ≥ 10; n = 3,352). Individuals allocated to treatment in both trials were provided access to digital cognitive behavioural therapy. Digital cognitive behavioural therapy significantly improved insomnia (p < .001; g = 0.76) and depressive symptoms (p < .001; g = 0.48) at post-intervention (weeks 8-10), and increased the odds (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.34, 3.65) of clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10). Improvements in insomnia symptoms at mid-intervention mediated 87% of the effects on depressive symptoms at post-intervention. No variables moderated effectiveness outcomes, suggesting generalizability of these findings. Our results suggest that effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia extend to depressive symptoms in those with clinically significant depressive symptomatology. Insomnia may, therefore, be an important therapeutic target to assist management of depressive symptoms."

Previous studies have shown that mobile health (mHealth) interventions offer an accessible means to facilitate early detection and management of mental health issues while at the same time promoting preventive care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Leveraging on Virtual Engagement for Maternal Understanding & Mood-enhancement (LoVE4MUM) mobile app, which was developed based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation and serves as an intervention to prevent postpartum depression. METHODS: This single-blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial includes 64 mothers recruited from the postnatal ward and randomized using a 1:1 ratio to receive either postpartum care (treatment as usual) or postpartum care (treatment as usual) plus the self-guided LoVE4MUM mobile app. The primary outcome is the effectiveness of the mobile app at improving postpartum depression. Secondary outcomes are changes in the mental health literacy score and negative automatic thoughts, which are collected using a self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: Patient recruitment began on September 1, 2024. As of January 1, 2025, recruitment was successfully completed, with a total of 72 participants enrolled: 36 in the intervention group and 36 in the control group . The final results are anticipated to be available by March 2025, and publication is expected by the end of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: By examining the LoVE4MUM app alongside standard postpartum care, this pilot randomized controlled trial seeks to offer preliminary evidence on the potential of mHealth tools to improve maternal mental health as well as to reduce postpartum depression symptoms. The findings are expected to contribute to the future development of effective, accessible, and scalable interventions for mothers.

Differing worldviews of service providers and First Nations young people regarding illness and treatment practices, language differences, culturally inappropriate service models, geographical remoteness, and stigma can all inhibit access to appropriate mental health support. Mental health treatments delivered digitally (digital mental health; dMH) offer flexible access to evidence-based, nonstigmatizing, low-cost treatment and early intervention on a broad scale. There is a rapidly growing use and acceptance of these technologies among young First Nations people. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and use of the newly developed Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative for Youth (AIMhi-Y) app and determine the feasibility of study procedures in preparation for future assessments of effectiveness. METHODS: This was a nonrandomized pre-post study using mixed methods. First Nations young people aged 12-25 years who provided consent (with parental consent where appropriate) and possessed the ability to navigate a simple app with basic English literacy were included. Researchers conducted one face-to-face 20-minute session with participants to introduce and orient them to the AIMhi-Y app. The app integrates culturally adapted low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, and mindfulness-based activities. Participants received supportive text messages weekly throughout the 4-week intervention period and completed assessments of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, substance misuse, help-seeking, service use, and parent-rated strengths and difficulties at baseline and 4 weeks. Qualitative interviews and rating scales were completed at 4 weeks to gain feedback on subjective experience, look and style, content, overall rating, check-ins, and involvement in the study. App use data were collected. RESULTS: Thirty young people (17 males and 13 females) aged between 12 and 18 (mean 14.0, SD 1.55) years were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks. Repeated measures 2-tailed t tests showed improvements in well-being measures that were statistically and clinically significant for psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, 10-item) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, 2-item). Participants spent on average 37 minutes in the app. The app was rated positively, with mean ratings of 4 out of 5 points (on scales of 1-5). Participants reported that they found the app easy to use, culturally relevant, and useful. The feasibility of the study was demonstrated with a 62% recruitment rate, a 90% retention rate, and high study acceptability ratings. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports earlier research suggesting that dMH apps that are appropriately designed with and for the target populations are a feasible and acceptable means of lowering symptoms for mental health disorders among First Nations youth."

METHOD: A non-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted. The study population consisted of women attended to three health care centers in Kerman, Iran. Participants were recruited between September and November 2018, and randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group (mobile application access) or control group (no mobile application access). All participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the baseline and 2 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using inferential statistics including chi-square, independent sample t-test, paired t-test and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 75 women with an average age of 27 years participated in this study. Before the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference between the EPDS score between the two groups (p > 0.001). However, in the intervention group, the average EPDS score after intervention was 8.18 and in the control group was 15.05, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings provide proof that providing a CBT program using a mobile application can lead to clinically important improvements in outcomes for mothers who suffer from postpartum depression."

Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed study is to test the efficacy of the intervention. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17 years of age, respectively) with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-score > 70). A total of 280 participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30 days thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study. DISCUSSION: Internet-delivered interventions play a major role in increasing access to mental health care. A brief, manualised, internet-delivered intervention might help children and adolescents with anxiety or depressive symptomatology, even outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent increases in both asthma and obesity among youth have led to high health care utilization, increased health related complications, and expanded risks of subsequent cardiovascular disease burden. Common symptoms seen with asthma and obesity include fatigue, pain, depression, and anxiety. These symptoms can result in decreased physical activity, social isolation, and poor quality of life, which also may contribute to increased morbidity and mortality over time. Youth ages 10-17 are in a transitionary period where their overall health and disease management shifts from one of parental oversight to one where the youth gradually experience increased autonomy over their health and care management. Managing Asthma and Obesity Related Symptoms (MATADORS), is a mHealth technology-enhanced nurse-guided intervention that incorporates a novel mobile health application and motivational enhancement principles within a behavioral activation framework. Providing high-risk youth with strategies to enhance symptom self-management may result in decreased symptom prevalence, improved quality of life, and long-term reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as they move into adulthood. Moreover, developing low-cost, scalable tools with end-user input may facilitate promote early intervention and improved access to care, and reduce overall disease burden and healthcare costs."

Previous studies targeting insomnia with fully automated eHealth interventions to prevent depression are inconclusive: dropout was high and likely biased, and depressive symptoms in untreated participants on average improved rather than worsened. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to efficiently prevent the worsening of depressive symptoms by selecting insomnia subtypes at high risk of depression for internet-based circadian rhythm support (CRS), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), or their combination (CBT-I+CRS), with online therapist guidance to promote adherence. METHODS: Participants with an insomnia disorder subtype conveying an increased risk of depression (n = 132) were randomized to no treatment (NT), CRS, CBT-I, or CBT-I+CRS. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (IDS-SR) was self-administered at baseline and at four follow-ups spanning 1 year. RESULTS: Without treatment, depressive symptoms indeed worsened (d = 0.28, p = 0.041) in high-risk insomnia, but not in a reference group with low-risk insomnia. Therapist-guided CBT-I and CBT-I+CRS reduced IDS-SR ratings across all follow-up assessments (respectively, d = -0.80, p = 0.001; d = -0.95, p < 0.001). Only CBT-I+CRS reduced the 1-year incidence of clinically meaningful worsening (p = 0.002). Dropout during therapist-guided interventions was very low (8%) compared to previous automated interventions (57-62%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings tentatively suggest that the efficiency of population-wide preventive strategies could benefit from the possibility to select insomnia subtypes at high risk of developing depression for therapist-guided digital CBT-I+CRS. This treatment may provide effective long-term prevention of worsening of depressive symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: the Netherlands Trial Register (NL7359)."

These so-called third-wave CBTs emphasize function and context of inner experience over form and content, and have become evidence-based practice in the past four decades. Among these approaches, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has both a large body of research for various (mental) health conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD) in particular. ACT is a transdiagnostic approach that intends to increase psychological flexibility (PF) of clients as a universal mechanism of behavior change and a value-driven orientation in life. By focusing on present-moment awareness, acceptance, defusion, establishing a stable sense of self, clarifying personal valued life directions, and committing to behaviors consistent to these values, ACT targets the core processes of PF. Meta-analyses have indicated the efficacy and effectiveness of ACT in reducing depressive symptoms and increasing well-being, with mainly moderate effect sizes in clinical trials. ACT for MDD has been shown to be effective across different delivery modes (e.g., individual, group, digital). ACT can also be applied using self-help formats (e.g., mobile apps) and combined with features from compatible approaches like behavioral activation. There is also evidence for a high acceptability of ACT and adherence rates comparable to classic CBT. Moreover, process research has shown that ACT works specifically through the mediator of PF and by addressing its suggested core therapeutic processes. Given the essential role of offering a personalized therapeutic strategy in treatment outcomes and adherence, it is central to provide more effective options that match clients' needs and preferences. This chapter illustrates different applications of ACT for adults with MDD and the current evidence base to promote informed decisions on using ACT as additional or stand-alone therapeutic approach."

Prevention is a key to reducing this burden. Guided internet cognitive-behavioural therapies (iCBT) appear promising but there is room for improvement because we do not yet know which of various iCBT skills are more efficacious than others, and for whom. In addition, there has been no platform for iCBT that can accommodate ongoing evolution of internet technologies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Based on our decade-long experiences in developing smartphone CBT apps and examining them in randomised controlled trials, we have developed the Resilience Training App Version 2. This app now covers five CBT skills: cognitive restructuring, behavioural activation, problem-solving, assertion training and behaviour therapy for insomnia. The current study is designed as a master protocol including four 2×2 factorial trials using this app (1) to elucidate specific efficacies of each CBT skill, (2) to identify participants' characteristics that enable matching between skills and individuals, and (3) to allow future inclusion of new skills. We will recruit 3520 participants with subthreshold depression and ca 1700 participants without subthreshold depression, to examine the short-term efficacies of CBT skills to reduce depressive symptoms in the former and to explore the long-term efficacies in preventing depression in the total sample. The primary outcome for the short-term efficacies is the change in depressive symptoms as measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at week 6, and that for the long-term efficacies is the incidence of major depressive episodes as assessed by the computerised Composite International Diagnostic Interview by week 50. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine (C1556). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000047124."

Evidence that supports the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) as an adjuvant therapy for AD remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary efficacy of additional dCBT and potential neurotransmitter biomarkers for AD accompanied by negative emotions. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AD were recruited and examined for clinical severity and negative emotions including insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Patients with mild-to-moderate negative emotions were divided into two groups that received standard care (N = 9) or mobile app-delivered CBT plus standard care (N = 11) for 12 weeks. Plasma levels of 40 neurotransmitters were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: Skin lesions, itch, and insomnia were significantly improved in both treatment groups. Improvements of itch (P = 0.0449) and insomnia (P = 0.0089) were more robust in the combination treatment group than those in the standard treatment group. Neurotransmitters that involve tryptophan, dopamine, and histidine pathways were markedly altered in patients with AD compared with healthy controls. Taurine levels were selectively increased following dCBT plus standard care (P = 0.0259). Baseline levels of L-tyrosine were negatively correlated with the reduction of skin lesions (r = -0.9073, P = 0.0334) and itch intensity (r = -0.9322, P = 0.0210) in the combination therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: dCBT provides an efficacious supplementary approach for AD accompanied by negative emotions. Emotion-related neurotransmitters may contribute to AD and serve as indicators for treatment effects."

Several of these factors are modifiable, such as depression and anxiety. However, primary care physiotherapists who typically manage these patients indicate that they do not feel sufficiently competent and equipped to address these factors optimally. We developed an eHealth intervention with a focus on pain education and behavioural activation to support physiotherapists in managing psychosocial factors in patients with spinal pain. This paper describes the protocol for a pragmatic randomised clinical trial, which evaluates the effectiveness of this eHealth intervention blended with physiotherapy compared with physiotherapy alone. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants with non-specific low back pain and/or neck pain for at least 6 weeks who also have psychosocial risk factors associated with the development or maintenance of persistent pain will be recruited in a pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised clinical trial. The experimental intervention consists of physiotherapy blended with six online modules of pain education and behavioural activation. The control intervention consists of usual care physiotherapy. The primary outcomes are disability (Oswestry Disability Index for low back pain and Neck Disability Index for neck pain) and perceived effect (Global Perceived Effect). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 months after baseline. The results will be analysed using linear mixed models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of VU Medical Center Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2017.286). Results will be reported in peer-reviewed journals, at national and international conferences, and in diverse media to share the findings with patients, clinicians and the public.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1011585,Reducing craving and lapse risk in alcohol and stimulants dependence using mobile app involving ecological momentary assessment and self-guided psychological interventions: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Obarska K, Binkowska AA, Marcowski P, Szymczak K, Lewczuk K, Sollich K, Banaszak M, Woronowicz B, Nowicka M, Skorko M, Gola M.",Front Psychiatry,2022,2023.1.2,,,"Erratum in Front Psychiatry. 2023 Feb 01;14:1146451. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1146451. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of alcohol consumption in Poland is estimated to be as high as 80% of the adult population. The use of stimulants is the second most common reason for seeking addiction treatment. However, treatment outcomes remain unsatisfactory, as 40-85% of individuals who complete various treatment programs relapse and fall back into addiction within 2 years following program completion. METHODS: The 13-armed randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of a mobile app-based self-guided psychological intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Nałogometr) in reducing craving and lapse risk in problematic alcohol or stimulants use. Participant recruitment and data collection will be performed from June 2022 to September 2022. The 4-week mobile intervention program will include short-term and long-term intervention modules based mainly on mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Intervention effectiveness assessment will include Ecological Momentary Assessment. That is, we will collect longitudinal data on a set of characteristics of day-to-day functioning. The primary outcomes will include a self-reported number of lapses and addiction craving level. In contrast, the secondary outcomes will be the severity of problematic substance use, anxiety and depression scores, and life satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION: This study will establish how mobile app-based self-guided psychological interventions can help reduce craving and lapse risk in alcohol and stimulant dependence. If successful, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) may provide an innovative, easily available, and cost-effective mHealth approach for craving and lapse risk in substance addictions.

10.1186/s13063-021-05179-8,A smartphone-assisted brief online cognitive-behavioral intervention for pregnant women with depression: a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Zuccolo PF, Xavier MO, Matijasevich A, Polanczyk G, Fatori D.",Trials,2021,2021.3.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is strongly associated with increased risk for depression. Approximately 25% of pregnant women develop depression. Treatment for depression during pregnancy has several complexities: the use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy might result in developmental problems in the child and must be used with caution. Psychosocial interventions are effective, but they require specialized professionals. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil do not have enough mental health professionals needed to meet this demand. In this context, smartphone-based interventions show immense potential. We developed Motherly, a smartphone application (app) designed to treat maternal depression. We aim to test the efficacy of Motherly in addition to brief cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) to treat maternal depression. METHODS: We will conduct a 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial in which 70 pregnant women aged between 16 and 40 years with depression will be randomized to intervention or active control. The intervention group will have access to Motherly, a smartphone app based on three concepts: psychoeducation, behavior monitoring, and gaming elements. Motherly is composed of a package of interventions composed of modules: mental health, sleep, nutrition, physical activity, social support, prenatal/postnatal support, and educational content. The main focus of Motherly is delivering behavioral activation (BA), a brief and structured psychological treatment. The app allows participants to schedule and engage in, and monitor activities according to a plan to avoid acting exclusively according to their mood. The active control group will have access to a simplified version of the app consisting of educational content about various aspects of pregnancy, maternal physical and mental health, and infant development (BA, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, among other functionalities, will not be present in this version). Both groups will receive four sessions of brief CBT in 8 weeks. Participants will be evaluated by assessors blind to randomization and allocation status. Assessments will occur at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4-5), posttreatment (T2, week 8), and follow-up (T3, when the child is 2 months old). Maternal mental health (prenatal anxiety, psychological well-being, perceived stress, depression, depression severity, and sleep quality), quality of life, physical activity levels, and infant developmental milestones and social/emotional problems will be measured. Our primary outcome is the change in maternal prenatal depression from baseline to posttreatment (8 weeks). DISCUSSION: The potential of digital technology to deliver mental health interventions has been increasingly recognized worldwide. There is a growing literature on interventions using smartphone applications to promote mental health, both with or without the intermediation of a mental health professional. Our study adds to the literature by testing whether an app providing an intervention package, including CBT, psychoeducation, nutrition, physical activity, and social support, can promote maternal and child health and well-being. In particular, we aim to treat depression, for which the use of digital technologies is still scarce. Smartphone applications designed to treat maternal depression are especially relevant because of the potential to circumvent barriers that prevent pregnant women from accessing mental health care.

10.1016/j.xjmad.2023.100003,Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST) in anxiety and depression: An experience sampling study,"Garland MM, Wilson R, Adamic E, Thompson WK, Arevian AC, Stein MB, Paulus MP, Feinstein JS, Khalsa SS.",J Mood Anxiety Disord,2023,2024.6.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST) is a behavioral intervention that systematically attenuates external sensory input to the nervous system. Previous studies have demonstrated acute anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of single sessions of REST in anxious individuals, however the duration and time course of these effects is unknown. In the current study, we used experience sampling and multiple sessions of REST to explore the time course of the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects over a 48-hour time period. METHODS: 75 adults with anxiety and/or depression were randomized to complete 6 sessions of REST (either pool-REST, pool-REST preferred, or chair-REST). Post-REST effects were tracked using experience sampling on a smartphone with a ten-item survey administered at 6 time points for each session (i.e., immediately before and after REST and then 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours later). Using principal component analysis, responses to survey items at baseline were reduced to broad symptom clusters of anxiety, depression, and serenity and were utilized in linear mixed effects models to determine the magnitude and time course of post-REST effects. RESULTS: REST was associated with significant decreases in anxiety and depression, and significant increases in serenity, with effects lasting for 48 hours. Repeated exposure to REST was associated with lower baseline levels of anxiety at later sessions. CONCLUSION: These initial findings suggest that the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of REST persist for at least two days, and that repeated REST sessions may have additive effects on lowering anxiety-related symptoms. These findings could help to determine the optimal intervention frequency of REST and facilitate future investigations focused on the combination of REST with standard treatments for anxiety and depression."

In Northern Ireland, anxiety disorders appear to be more common among the university student population due to the population demographics across the region. Despite the need, these students show less inclination to access the widely available on-campus well-being services and other external professional services. Digital cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to bridge this gap between the need for psychological help and access to it. However, challenges such as limited reach, low adoption, implementation barriers and poor long-term maintenance are mainstay issues resulting in reduced uptake of digital CBT. As a result, the potential impact of digital CBT is currently restricted. The proposed intervention 'Cerina' is a scalable CBT-based mobile app with an interactive user interface that can be implemented in university settings if found to be feasible and effective. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a single-blind pilot feasibility randomised controlled trial aiming to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of Cerina in reducing Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms. Participants are 90 Ulster University students aged 18 and above with self-reported GAD symptoms. They will be allocated to two conditions: treatment (ie, access to Cerina for 6 weeks) and a wait-list control group (ie, optional on-campus well-being services for 6 weeks). Participants in the wait-list will access Cerina 6 weeks after their randomisation and participants in both conditions will be assessed at baseline, at 3 (mid-assessment) and 6 weeks (postassessment). The primary outcome is the feasibility of Cerina (ie, adherence to the intervention, its usability and the potential to deliver a full trial in the future). The secondary outcomes include generalised anxiety, depression, worry and quality of life. Additionally, participants in both conditions will be invited to semistructured interviews for process evaluation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been granted by the Ulster University Research Ethics Committee (ID: FCPSY-22-084). The results of the study will be disseminated through publications in scientific articles and presentations at relevant conferences and/or public events. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06146530."

Expanding the reach or access to effective evidence-based treatments to help persons with AUD is a public health objective. Mobile phone or smartphone technology has the potential to increase the dissemination of clinical and behavioral interventions (mobile health interventions) that increase the initiation and maintenance of sobriety among individuals with AUD. Studies about how this group uses their mobile phone and their attitudes toward technology may have meaningful implications for participant engagement with these interventions. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study examined the potential relationships among demographic characteristics (race, gender, age, marital status, and income), substance use characteristics (frequency of alcohol and cannabis use), and clinical variables (anxiety and depression symptoms) with indicators of mobile phone use behaviors and attitudes toward technology. METHODS: A sample of 71 adults with AUD (mean age 42.9, SD 10.9 years) engaged in an alcohol partial hospitalization program completed 4 subscales from the Media Technology Usage and Attitudes assessment: Smartphone Usage measures various mobile phone behaviors and activities, Positive Attitudes and Negative Attitudes measure attitudes toward technology, and the Technological Anxiety/Dependence measure assesses level of anxiety when individuals are separated from their phone and dependence on this device. Participants also provided demographic information and completed the Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Lastly, participants reported their frequency of alcohol use over the past 3 months using the Drug Use Frequency Scale. RESULTS: Results for the demographic factors showed a significant main effect for age, Smartphone Usage (P=.003; ηp2=0.14), and Positive Attitudes (P=.01; ηp2=0.07). Marital status (P=.03; ηp2=0.13) and income (P=.03; ηp2=0.14) were associated only with the Technological Anxiety and Dependence subscale. Moreover, a significant trend was found for alcohol use and the Technological Anxiety/Dependence subscale (P=.06; R2=0.02). Lastly, CES-D scores (P=.03; R2=0.08) and GAD symptoms (P=.004; R2=0.13) were significant predictors only of the Technological Anxiety/Dependence subscale. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate differences in mobile phone use patterns and attitudes toward technology across demographic, substance use, and clinical measures among patients with AUD. These results may help inform the development of future mHealth interventions among this population."
10.2196/36203,Digital Mental Health Intervention Plus Usual Care Compared With Usual Care Only and Usual Care Plus In-Person Psychological Counseling for Orthopedic Patients With Symptoms of Depression or Anxiety: Cohort Study,"Leo AJ, Schuelke MJ, Hunt DM, Miller JP, Areán PA, Cheng AL.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.5.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety frequently coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain and can negatively impact patients' responses to standard orthopedic treatments. Nevertheless, mental health is not routinely addressed in the orthopedic care setting. If effective, a digital mental health intervention may be a feasible and scalable method of addressing mental health in an orthopedic setting. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare 2-month changes in mental and physical health between orthopedic patients who received a digital mental health intervention in addition to usual orthopedic care, those who received usual orthopedic care only (without a specific mental health intervention), and those who received in-person care with a psychologist as part of their orthopedic treatment plan. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study involving ancillary analysis of a pilot feasibility study, 2-month self-reported health changes were compared between a cohort of orthopedic patients who received access to a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) and 2 convenience sample comparison cohorts (patients who received usual orthopedic care without a specific mental health intervention and patients who received in-person care with a psychologist as part of their orthopedic treatment plan). All patients were 18 years or older and reported elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety at an orthopedic clinic visit (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression or Anxiety score ≥55). The digital intervention was a multi-component mobile app that used chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors to provide cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features, with an emphasis on behavioral activation and pain acceptance. Outcomes of interest were between-cohort differences in the 2-month longitudinal changes in PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores (primary outcomes) and PROMIS Pain Interference and Physical Function scores (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: Among 153 patients (mean age 55, SD 15 years; 128 [83.7%] female; 51 patients per cohort), patients who received the digital mental health intervention showed clinically meaningful improvements at the 2-month follow-up for all PROMIS measures (mean longitudinal improvement 2.8-3.7 points; P≤.02). After controlling for age and BMI, the improvements in PROMIS Depression, Pain Interference, and Physical Function were meaningfully greater than longitudinal changes shown by patients who received usual orthopedic care (mean between-group difference 2.6-4.8 points; P≤.04). Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function were also meaningfully greater than longitudinal changes shown by patients who received in-person psychological counseling (mean between-group difference 2.4 points; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received a digital mental health intervention as part of orthopedic care reported greater 2-month mean improvements in depression, pain interference, and physical function than patients who received usual orthopedic care. They also reported a greater mean improvement in physical function and comparable improvements in depression, anxiety, and pain interference compared with orthopedic patients who received in-person psychological counseling."
10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.141,The effect of smartphone-based monitoring and treatment on the rate and duration of psychiatric readmission in patients with unipolar depressive disorder: The RADMIS randomized controlled trial,"Tønning ML, Faurholt-Jepsen M, Frost M, Martiny K, Tuxen N, Rosenberg N, Busk J, Winther O, Melbye SA, Thaysen-Petersen D, Aamund KA, Tolderlund L, Bardram JE, Kessing LV.",J Affect Disord,2021,2021.1.9,,,"BACKGROUND: Patients with unipolar depressive disorder are frequently hospitalized, and the period following discharge is a high-risk-period. Smartphone-based treatments are receiving increasing attention among researchers, clinicians, and patients. We aimed to investigate whether a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system reduces the rate and duration of readmissions, more than standard treatment, in patients with unipolar depressive disorder following hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The intervention group received a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system in addition to standard treatment. The system allowed patients to self-monitor symptoms and access psycho-educative information and cognitive modules. The patients were allocated a study-nurse who, based on the monitoring data, guided and supported them. The control group received standard treatment. The trial lasted six months, with outcome assessments at 0, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: We included 120 patients with unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10). Intention-to-treat analyses showed no statistically significant differences in time to readmission (Log-Rank p=0.9) or duration of readmissions (B=-16.41,95%CI:-47.32;25.5,p=0.3) (Primary outcomes). There were no differences in clinically rated depressive symptoms (p=0.6) or functioning (p=0.1) (secondary outcomes). The intervention group had higher levels of recovery (B=7,29, 95%CI:0.82;13,75,p=0.028) and a tendency towards higher quality of life (p=0.07), wellbeing (p=0,09) satisfaction with treatment (p=0.05) and behavioral activation (p=0.08) compared with the control group (tertiary outcomes). LIMITATIONS: Patients and study-nurses were unblinded to allocation. CONCLUSIONS: We found no effect of the intervention on primary or secondary outcomes. In tertiary outcomes, patients in the intervention group reported higher levels of recovery compared to the control group."

Although digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered an effective treatment, African American individuals are less likely to engage in and adhere to digital therapies for mental health disorders compared with White individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand digital CBT mental health treatment perceptions and preferences of African American individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: African American individuals with SCD from various US locations were invited to participate in a series of focus groups. Participants were introduced to a health coach-supported mental health app and then asked a series of questions about the usability and appeal of the program as well as, more generally, what would make a digital mental health program effective for them. The authors reviewed the focus group transcripts and conducted a qualitative analysis of the results. RESULTS: A total of 25 people participated in 5 focus groups. Overall, 5 primary themes emerged regarding how app content and related coaching could be modified to enhance digital CBT engagement. These themes included connection with others living with SCD, the personalization of app content and coaching, characteristics of coaches, journaling and pain tracking, and considerations for optimal engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing the user experience by making digital CBT tools relevant to patient populations is critical for optimizing program engagement and its uptake. Our findings highlight potential strategies to modify and design digital CBT tools for users with SCD and may also be applicable to patients with other chronic conditions.

10.2196/20969,Designing Asynchronous Remote Support for Behavioral Activation in Teenagers With Depression: Formative Study,"Bhattacharya A, Nagar R, Jenness J, Munson SA, Kientz JA.",JMIR Form Res,2021,2021.7.13,,,"BACKGROUND: Many teenagers in the United States experience challenges with symptoms of depression, and they lack adequate resources for accessing in-person mental health care. Involving teens and clinicians in designing technologies that use evidence-based practices that reduce barriers to accessing mental health care is crucial. Interventions based on behavioral activation (BA) help teens understand the relationship between mood and activity, help them practice goal-directed behaviors to improve mood, and may be particularly well-suited to delivery via internet-based platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the needs and challenges that teens and mental health clinicians face in depression management and involve them in the design process of a remote intervention that uses asynchronous remote communities. Our goal is to understand the benefits and challenges of adapting BA to an internet-based platform that supports the asynchronous remote community approach as a delivery tool for teen depression management. METHODS: We enrolled mental health clinicians (n=10) and teens (n=8) in separate, private, internet-based groups on Slack (Slack Technologies Inc). They participated in 20-minute design activities for 10 weeks and were then invited to interviews about their experiences in the study. RESULTS: Both teen and clinician participants wanted internet-based support for BA as a supplement to in-person therapy. Although participants perceived the asynchronous format as conducive to supporting accessible care, teens and clinicians raised concerns about safety, privacy, and the moderating of the internet-based group. Design decisions that address these concerns need to be balanced with the potential benefits of learning coping skills, increasing access to mental health care, and promoting asynchronous human connection to support teens. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss considerations for balancing tensions in privacy and safety while designing and selecting internet-based platforms to support remote care and integrating evidence-based support when designing digital technologies for the treatment of teens with depression."

Mobile health (mHealth) approaches promise to deliver accessible and effective depression treatment; however, questions remain regarding how mHealth depression treatment efficacy may vary geographically based on urban and rural environmental contexts. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by leveraging data from a randomized clinical trial of an mHealth depression treatment called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-text (CBT-txt) as applied to a sample of 103 U.S. young adults (ages 18-25). Prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of CBT-txt to reduce depressive symptoms. In the present study, we conduct an exploratory, post hoc analysis employing moderated growth curve modeling to investigate whether observed treatment efficacy differed between study participants residing in rural versus urban areas. The findings indicate that CBT-txt treatment effects in terms of reducing depression symptoms were significantly stronger for young adults residing in rural, as compared to urban, regions (β = 13.759, 95% CI = 0.796, 26.723, p < 0.038). We speculate that this is because of the lack of mental healthcare resources in rural, as compared to urban areas, as well as the greater level of environmental stressors, such as artificial light and noise, found in cities, which may mitigate treatment effects."

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a recommended psychological therapy for GAD; however, there are substantial barriers to accessing treatment. Digital CBT, in particular smartphone-delivered CBT, has the potential to improve accessibility and increase dissemination of CBT. Despite the emerging evidence of smartphone-based psychological interventions for reducing anxiety, effect size scores are typically smaller than in-person interventions, and there is a lack of research assessing the efficacy of smartphone-delivered digital interventions specifically for GAD. METHODS: In the DeLTA trial (DigitaL Therapy for Anxiety), we plan to conduct a parallel-group superiority randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of a novel smartphone-based digital CBT intervention for GAD compared to a waitlist control. We aim to recruit 242 adults (aged 18 years or above) with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. This trial will be conducted entirely online and will involve assessments at baseline (week 0; immediately preceding randomisation), mid-intervention (week 3), post-intervention (week 6; primary end point) and follow-up (week 10). The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on GAD symptom severity compared to a waitlist control at post-intervention. Secondary objectives are to examine between-group effects on GAD at follow-up, and to examine the following secondary outcomes at both post-intervention and follow-up: 1) worry; 2) depressive symptoms; 3) wellbeing; 4) quality of life; and 5) sleep difficulty. DISCUSSION: This trial will report findings on the initial efficacy of a novel digital CBT intervention for GAD. Results have the potential to contribute towards the evidence base for digital CBT for GAD and increase the dissemination of CBT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12765810.

SETTING: The study was conducted online with Australian individuals recruited through the community. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 50 young people aged 12-16 years with sleep difficulties. DESIGN: A single-arm pre-post design was used to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and sleep and mental health variables at baseline and postintervention. INTERVENTION: Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia informed the development of the Sleep Ninja. The core strategies covered by the app are psychoeducation, stimulus control, sleep hygiene and sleep-related cognitive therapy. It includes six training sessions (lessons), a sleep tracking function, recommended bedtimes based on sleep guidelines, reminders to start a wind-down routine each night, a series of sleep tips and general information about sleep. Users progress through each training session and conclude the 6-week programme with a black belt in sleep. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was evaluated based on consent rates, adherence and attrition, acceptability was assessed using questionnaires and a poststudy interview, and sleep, depression and anxiety variables were assessed at baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: Data indicated that the Sleep Ninja is a feasible intervention and is acceptable to young people. Findings showed that there were significant improvements on sleep variables including insomnia (within-group effect size d=-0.90), sleep quality (d=-0.46), depression (d=-0.36) and anxiety (d=-0.41). CONCLUSIONS: The Sleep Ninja is a promising intervention that could assist adolescents who experience sleep difficulties. A follow-up randomised controlled trial is now warranted.

The gold standard treatment, in vivo exposure therapy, is effective, but comes with significant limitations, including restricted availability, high costs, and high refusal rates. Novel technologies, such as augmented reality, may help to overcome these limitations and make Exposure Therapy more accessible by using mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: This study will use a Randomized Controlled Trial design to investigate whether ZeroPhobia: Arachnophobia, a 6-week Augmented Reality Exposure Therapy smartphone self-help application, can effectively reduce spider phobia symptoms. Additionally, we will examine user-friendliness of the application and the effect of usage intensity and presence on treatment outcome. METHODS: This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry under NL70238.029.19 (Trial NL9221). Ethical approval was received on October 11, 2019. One-hundred-twelve participants (age 18-64, score ≥ 59) on the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire [FSQ] will be recruited from the general Dutch population and randomly assigned to a treatment or waitlist control group. The ZeroPhobia application can be accessed on users' smartphone. Baseline, post-test (i.e., at six weeks), 3- and 12-month follow-up assessments will be done, each including the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire as the main outcome measure as well as additional measures of anxiety, depression, user-friendliness, and presence as secondary measures and covariates. RESULTS: The study was funded on September 25, 2018. Data collection started in September 2021 and the study is expected to run until September 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will improve our understanding of the efficacy and feasibility of providing Exposure Therapy for spider phobia using an Augmented Reality self-help application, with the intention of making mental health care more accessible."

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral digital therapeutic, reclarit, on psychosocial outcomes in adult RA patients with impaired health-related quality of life. Participants were randomized to reclarit plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus educational and informational material (active control). The primary outcome was SF-36 mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component summary scores at 3 months, with additional assessments at 6 months. reclarit significantly improved SF-36 MCS scores compared to control (mean difference 3.3 [95% CI 0.7, 5.9]; p = 0.014), with high user satisfaction and sustained improvements at 6 months. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, and social/work functioning also improved significantly, while SF-36 PCS, pain, and disability scores did not differ. In conclusion, reclarit offers immediate, effective, evidence-based and personalized psychological support for RA patients."
10.1186/s12888-023-05185-x,Protocol for a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of a CBT-I smartphone application (Sleep Ninja®) on insomnia symptoms in children,"Subotic-Kerry M, Werner-Seidler A, Corkish B, Batterham PJ, Sicouri G, Hudson J, Christensen H, O'Dea B, Li SH.",BMC Psychiatry,2023,2023.9.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Sleep is necessary for healthy development and mental wellbeing. Despite this, many children do not get the recommended duration of sleep each night, and many experience sleep problems. Although treatable, existing interventions for sleep disturbance are time-consuming, burdensome for families, and focus on providing behavioural strategies to parents rather than upskilling children directly. To address this gap, we modified Sleep Ninja®, an evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) smartphone app for adolescent sleep disturbance, to be appropriate for 10 to 12 year olds. Here, we describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of Sleep Ninja on insomnia and other outcomes, including depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness, and explore effects on the emergence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), compared to an active control group. METHODS: We aim to recruit 214 children aged 10 to 12 years old experiencing disturbed sleep. Participants will be screened for inclusion, complete the baseline assessment, and then be randomly allocated to receive Sleep Ninja, or digital psychoeducation flyers (active control) for 6-weeks. The primary outcome, insomnia symptoms, along with depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness will be assessed at 6-weeks (primary endpoint), 3-months, and 9-months post-baseline (secondary and tertiary endpoints, respectively). A mixed model repeated measures analytic approach will be used to conduct intention-to-treat analyses to determine whether reductions in insomnia and secondary outcomes are greater for those receiving Sleep Ninja relative to the control condition at the primary and secondary endpoints. The difference in relative risk for MDD onset will be explored at 9-months and compared between conditions. DISCUSSION: This is the first clinical trial examining the effects of a CBT-I smartphone app in children experiencing sleep disturbance. Results will provide empirical evidence about the effects of Sleep Ninja on insomnia and other mental health outcomes.

10.2196/42360,A Digital Self-help Intervention for Atopic Dermatitis: Analysis of Secondary Outcomes From a Feasibility Study,"Kern D, Ljótsson B, Lönndahl L, Hedman-Lagerlöf E, Bradley M, Lindefors N, Kraepelien M.",JMIR Dermatol,2023,2023.8.26,,,"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease characterized by dry skin, eczematous lesions, and an often severe pruritus. The disease may have a negative effect on quality of life and is also associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Few individuals with AD receive any form of behavioral intervention. Behavioral interventions for AD are potentially efficacious but need to be constructed so that they are safe, credible, and user-friendly. We have previously reported on a feasibility study that demonstrated that a self-management version of a digital intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for AD can potentially be effective in reducing AD symptoms. The aim of this secondary report was to further examine treatment feasibility and preliminary effects on dermatological quality of life, itching sensations, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. OBJECTIVE: This is a secondary report on intervention credibility, usability, adverse events, and preliminary effects on secondary measures of a self-management digital intervention for atopic dermatitis. METHODS: In total, 21 adults with AD, recruited nationwide in Sweden, were assessed by telephone, and used the digital intervention for 8 weeks. Participants were also assessed directly afterward and 3 months after the end of the intervention. There was no therapist guidance. Feasibility indicators included intervention credibility, usability, and possible adverse effects. Other measures included preliminary effects on dermatological quality of life, itching sensations, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. RESULTS: The intervention was regarded as credible and no serious adverse events were reported. System usability was, however, found to be below the predetermined cutoff for acceptable usability. Preliminary effects at 3-month follow-up were in the moderate to large range for dermatological quality of life (Cohen d=0.89, 95% CI 0.18-1.56), itching sensations (Cohen d=0.85, 95% CI 0.15-1.52), depressive symptoms (Cohen d=0.78, 95% CI 0.1-1.45), and perceived stress (Cohen d=0.75, 95% CI 0.01-1.36). CONCLUSIONS: This 8-week self-management digital CBT-based intervention was, together with telephone calls before and after, a feasible intervention for participants with AD. Preliminary effects were promising and should be explored further in a randomized controlled trial. Intervention usability was, however, rated below cutoff scores. Efforts should be made to improve written material to increase usability."

Their distress, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety, leads to poor quality of life, increased medical spending due to frequent visits, and decrease in treatment adherence. It is estimated that 30-50% among them would require support from mental health professionals: in reality, much less actually receive such support partly due to a shortage of qualified professionals and also due to psychological barriers in seeking such help. The purpose of the present study is to develop the easily accessible and the most efficient and effective smartphone psychotherapy package to alleviate depression and anxiety in cancer patients. METHODS: Based on the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, the SMartphone Intervention to LEssen depression/Anxiety and GAIN resilience project (SMILE-AGAIN project) is a parallel-group, multicenter, open, stratified block randomized, fully factorial trial with four experimental components: psychosocial education (PE), behavioral activation (BA), assertion training (AT), and problem-solving therapy (PS). The allocation sequences are maintained centrally. All participants receive PE and then are randomized to the presence/absence of the remaining three components. The primary outcome of this study is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score, which will be administered as an electronic patient-reported outcome on the patients' smartphones after 8 weeks. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nagoya City University on July 15, 2020 (ID: 46-20-0005). The randomized trial, which commenced in March 2021, is currently enrolling participants. The estimated end date for this study is March 2023. DISCUSSION: The highly efficient experimental design will allow for the identification of the most effective components and the most efficient combinations among the four components of the smartphone psychotherapy package for cancer patients. Given that many cancer patients face significant psychological hurdles in seeing mental health professionals, easily accessible therapeutic interventions without hospital visits may offer benefits. If an effective combination of psychotherapy is determined in this study, it can be provided using smartphones to patients who cannot easily access hospitals or clinics.

10.2196/35538,"User Behavior of a Publicly Available, Free-to-Use, Self-guided mHealth App for Depression: Observational Study in a Global Sample","Su L, Anderson PL.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.10.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Reducing the burden of depression is a global health concern. Self-guided mobile health (mHealth) apps are one approach to address this problem. However, there is little research on self-guided mHealth apps in a global sample or on how they are used in the real world. These gaps in our knowledge must be addressed to bring the promise of mHealth apps for reducing the global burden of depression closer to reality. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the naturalistic user behavior of MoodTools, a publicly available, free-to-use, self-guided mHealth app designed to improve symptoms of depression, in a global community sample. METHODS: Mobile analytics data were collected from all unique downloads of the Android version of MoodTools between March 1, 2016, and February 28, 2018. Due to the deidentification and data aggregation process, no demographic or personal identifying information was tied to individual user data. All information was stored in aggregated, anonymized data files on Google Analytics' storage database. Google's software development kit was used to securely capture data about the number of downloads, location of downloads, number of app sessions, frequency and duration of app sessions, time between app sessions, and user retention, allowing for examination of which app's tools were viewed and for how long, including Information (psychoeducation), Test (self-monitoring using the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), Thought Diary (targeting negative cognitions), Activities (behavioral activation), Videos (curated from YouTube), and Safety Plan (safety plan development and links to quickly access crisis management resources). RESULTS: MoodTools was used by 158,930 people from 198 countries, including countries where English was not the primary language and in low- and middle-income countries. After the initial download, 51.14% (n=81,277) of users returned to the app after the initial download, and retention rates decreased with each subsequent app session. The typical person used the app for 3 sessions for a total of 12 minutes over 90 days. The most frequently visited tools were Test and Thought Diary (n=393,549, 24.32%). On average, users completed and reviewed the results of the PHQ-9 for 49 seconds and 53 seconds, respectively, and spent 3 minutes and 5 seconds on Thought Diary. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mHealth apps could be one approach (among the many needed) to reduce the burden of depression. Observational data collected in this study show a global interest in MoodTools, including in low- and middle-income countries and countries where English is not the primary language. Future research is needed to determine whether people who use self-guided apps experience improvement in depressive symptoms, and if so, what ""dosage"" provides a meaningful benefit."

The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation. RESULTS: After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario-based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious cognitive therapy. Long-term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new treatment format."

This randomised controlled, pilot phase-IIa trial aimed to study a physical exercise intervention (EI) and bright light therapy (BLT)-both implemented and monitored in an individual, naturalistic setting via a mobile health (m-health) system-for feasibility of trial design and interventions, and to estimate their effects on depressive symptoms in young people with ADHD. Two hundred seven participants aged 14-45 years were randomised to 10-week add-on intervention of either BLT (10,000 lx; daily 30-min sessions) (n = 70), EI (aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities 3 days/ week) (n = 69), or treatment-as-usual (TAU) (n = 68), of whom 165 (80%) were retained (BLT: n = 54; EI: n = 52; TAU: n = 59). Intervention adherence (i.e. ≥ 80% completed sessions) was very low for both BLT (n = 13, 22%) and EI (n = 4, 7%). Usability of the m-health system to conduct interventions was limited as indicated by objective and subjective data. Safety was high and comparable between groups. Changes in depressive symptoms (assessed via observer-blind ratings, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) between baseline and end of intervention were small (BLT: -0.124 [95% CI: -2.219, 1.971], EI: -2.646 [95% CI: -4.777, -0.515], TAU: -1.428 [95% CI: -3.381, 0.526]) with no group differences [F(2,153) = 1.45, p = 0.2384]. These findings suggest that the m-health approach did not achieve feasibility of EI and BLT in young people with ADHD. Prior to designing efficacy studies, strategies how to achieve high intervention adherence should be specifically investigated in this patient group.

Building emotional competence skills via a mobile app may be an effective, scalable and acceptable way to do this. A particular risk factor for anxiety and depression is elevated worry and rumination (repetitive negative thinking, RNT). An app designed to reduce RNT may prevent future incidence of depression and anxiety. METHOD/DESIGN: The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults study developed an emotional competence app to be tested via randomised controlled trials in a longitudinal prospective cohort. This off-shoot study adapts the app to focus on targeting RNT (worry, rumination), known risk factors for poor mental health. In this study, 16-24 year olds in the UK, who report elevated worry and rumination on standardised questionnaires are randomised to (i) receive the RNT-targeting app immediately for 6 weeks (ii) a waiting list control who receive the app after 6 weeks. In total, the study will aim to recruit 204 participants, with no current diagnosis of major depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis, across the UK. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 6 and 12 weeks post-randomisation. Primary endpoint and outcome for the study is level of rumination assessed on the Rumination Response Styles Questionnaire at 6 weeks. Worry, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and well-being are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to better understand the benefits of tackling RNT via an mobile phone app intervention in young people. This prevention mechanism trial will establish whether targeting worry and rumination directly via an app provides a feasible approach to prevent depression and anxiety, with scope to become a widescale public health strategy for preventing poor mental health and promoting well-being in young people.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic limiting in-person care, we sought to develop the counseling and mhealth app onboarding for virtual implementation. A team with SRH, adolescent medicine, motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and technology expertise adapted the counseling through an iterative consensus process. We identified essential aspects of the counseling, specified the content so the counseling could be delivered in person or virtually with fidelity, and considered best practices for telehealth for the focus population. Virtual counseling retained key elements from in-person counseling while including enhancements with engaging visual and audio-video aids. Instructions and programming were developed to support virtual counseling delivery and onboarding for the mhealth app component of MARSSI. After testing the virtual format in mock sessions, we implemented a small-scale feasibility study in an adolescent medicine clinic with women with depressive symptoms and high-risk sexual behavior age 18-24 years (N = 9). Participants experienced minimal technical difficulties and expressed satisfaction with the virtual format, and all were able to complete app onboarding successfully. Expanding delivery options for SRH interventions to include virtual can improve access, particularly for populations with psychological and environmental barriers to care."

A virtual randomized controlled trial was used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 5-week, self-guided, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile application, Spark, compared to a psychoeducational mobile application (Active Control) as an adjunct treatment for adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A community sample aged 13-21, with self-reported symptoms of depression, was recruited nationwide. Participants were randomly assigned to use either Spark or Active Control (NSpark = 35; NActive Control = 25). Questionnaires, including the PHQ-8 measuring depression symptoms, completed before, during, and immediately following completion of the intervention, evaluated depressive symptoms, usability, engagement, and participant safety. App engagement data were also analyzed. RESULTS: 60 eligible adolescents (female = 47) were enrolled in 2 months. 35.6% of those expressing interest were consented and all enrolled. Study retention was high (85%). Spark users rated the app as usable (System Usability Scalemean = 80.67) and engaging (User Engagement Scale-Short Formmean = 3.62). Median daily use was 29%, and 23% completed all levels. There was a significant negative relationship between behavioral activations completed and change in PHQ-8. Efficacy analyses revealed a significant main effect of time, F = 40.60, p < .001, associated with decreased PHQ-8 scores over time. There was no significant Group × Time interaction (F = 0.13, p = .72) though the numeric decrease in PHQ-8 was greater for Spark (4.69 vs. 3.56). No serious adverse events or adverse device effects were reported for Spark users. Two serious adverse events reported in the Active Control group were addressed per our safety protocol. CONCLUSION: Recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates demonstrated study feasibility by being comparable or better than other mental health apps. Spark was highly acceptable relative to published norms. The study's novel safety protocol efficiently detected and managed adverse events. The lack of significant difference in depression symptom reduction between Spark and Active Control may be explained by study design and study design factors. Procedures established during this feasibility study will be leveraged for subsequent powered clinical trials evaluating app efficacy and safety.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), both face to face or digitally delivered, has shown to be an effective intervention for prolonged grief symptoms. Self-help mobile apps offer various advantages and studies show improved mental health after app interventions. No app has yet been evaluated targeting prolonged grief in bereaved parents. Therefore, the aim of this planned study is to develop and examine the effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile app, called My Grief, in reducing symptoms of prolonged grief, as well as other psychological symptoms, in bereaved parents. Another aim is to assess users' experiences and adverse events of My Grief. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a two-armed randomised waitlist-controlled trial. Parents living in Sweden, who lost a child between one and ten years ago, with elevated symptoms of prolonged grief, will be recruited to participate in the trial. The content of My Grief covers four main domains (Learn; Self-monitoring; Exercises; Get support) and builds on principles of CBT and the proven-effective PTSD Coach app. Participants in the intervention group will fill out online questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-ups, and the waitlist-controls at baseline and at 3 months. The primary outcome will be prolonged grief symptoms at the 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are post-traumatic stress and depression symptoms, quality of life and cognitive behavioural variables (ie, avoidance, rumination, negative cognitions). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been received from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (project no. 2021-00770). If the app is shown to be effective, the app will be made publicly accessible on app stores, so that it can benefit other bereaved parents. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04552717."

Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated costs. Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being. There is a need to discern the active components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately improve users' mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study systematically identified mental health conversational agents (CAs) currently available in app stores and assessed the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used. We further described their main features, technical aspects, and quality in terms of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information using the Mobile Application Rating Scale. METHODS: The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and an evaluation following predefined criteria. We conducted a systematic app search of Apple's App Store and Google Play using 42matters. Apps with CAs in English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. The BCT taxonomy v1, a comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change components in CAs. RESULTS: We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. Most CAs had <1000 user ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). All CAs addressed >1 mental disorder. Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Half (9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). CAs used 48 different BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. The most common BCTs were 3.3 ""Social support (emotional),"" 4.1 ""Instructions for how to perform a behavior,"" 11.2 ""Reduce negative emotions,"" and 6.1 ""Demonstration of the behavior."" One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not include core CBT concepts. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. The most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental disorders with few therapeutic elements. CA developers should consider the quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management when designing mental health CAs. Future research should assess the role of artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital mental health interventions."

This study examined the effect of dCBT-I for improving sleep quality in patients with insomnia complaints from a clinical population in a real-world setting. METHODS: The study included 6,002 patients aged 18 years and above with primary complaints of dissatisfying sleep from a sleep clinic in a psychiatric hospital from November 2016 to April 2021. Patients were diagnosed with insomnia, anxiety disorders, or anxiety comorbid with insomnia or depression according to ICD-10. A mobile app was developed for self-reported assessment and delivering dCBT-I interventions and treatment prescriptions to participants. The primary outcome was change in global sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). At 8- and 12-week follow-up, 509 patients were reassessed. Data were analyzed with non-parametric tests for repeated measures. RESULTS: Patients treated with dCBT-I monotherapy were younger, with a more frequent family history of insomnia compared to those with medication monotherapy and those with combined dCBT-I and medication therapy. Improvements of sleep quality from baseline to 8-week follow-up were significant in each treatment type. Compared to 8-week follow-up, PSQI scores at 12-week were significantly decreased in the depression group receiving combined therapy and in the anxiety group treated with dCBT-I monotherapy and with combined therapy. A time-by-treatment interaction was detected in anxiety patients indicating differential reduction in PSQI scores over time between different treatment options. CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest dCBT-I is a practical and effective approach for lessening insomnia symptoms, especially for patients with anxiety symptoms suggesting with a more extended intervention period (i.e., 12 weeks).

10.1111/jcpp.13822,Evaluating a treatment selection approach for online single-session interventions for adolescent depression,"Ahuvia IL, Mullarkey MC, Sung JY, Fox KR, Schleider JL.",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,2023,2023.5.15,,,"Comment in J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2024 Feb;65(2):248-250. doi: 10.1111/jcpp.13914. BACKGROUND: The question 'what works for whom' is essential to mental health research, as matching individuals to the treatment best suited to their needs has the potential to maximize the effectiveness of existing approaches. Digitally administered single-session interventions (SSIs) are effective means of reducing depressive symptoms in adolescence, with potential for rapid, large-scale implementation. However, little is known about which SSIs work best for different adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We created and tested a treatment selection algorithm for use with two SSIs targeting depression in high-symptom adolescents from across the United States. METHODS: Using data from a large-scale RCT comparing two evidence-based SSIs (N = 996; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04634903), we utilized a Personalized Advantage Index approach to create and evaluate a treatment-matching algorithm for these interventions. The two interventions were Project Personality (PP; N = 482), an intervention teaching that traits and symptoms are malleable (a 'growth mindset'), and the Action Brings Change Project (ABC; N = 514), a behavioral activation intervention. RESULTS: Results indicated no significant difference in 3-month depression outcomes between participants assigned to their matched intervention and those assigned to their nonmatched intervention. The relationship between predicted response to intervention (RTI) and observed RTI was weak for both interventions (r = .39 for PP, r = .24 for ABC). Moreover, the correlation between a participants' predicted RTI for PP and their predicted RTI for ABC was very high (r = .79). CONCLUSIONS: The utility of treatment selection approaches for SSIs targeting adolescent depression appears limited. Results suggest that both (a) predicting RTI for SSIs is relatively challenging, and (b) the factors that predict RTI for SSIs are similar regardless of the content of the intervention. Given their overall effectiveness and their low-intensity, low-cost nature, increasing youths' access to both digital SSIs may carry more public health utility than additional treatment-matching efforts."

Moreover, addiction treatment has several barriers, such as a lack of access to professional treatment or stigmatization. Mobile health interventions emerge as a promising solution. METHODS: This two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the efficacy of a mobile app-based self-guided psychological intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Nałogometr) in reducing craving and lapse risk in problematic behaviors and substance use compared to a control condition. Participant recruitment and data collection will start in June 2022 and end in September 2022. Due to the nature of the study, i.e., a nationwide study of problematic substance use and behaviors, we will aim to recruit all individuals willing to participate. The four-week intervention condition includes short-term and long-term modules based mainly on mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Longitudinal data on several variables related to craving and lapse risk are collected daily using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The primary outcomes of interest will be the self-reported number of lapses and craving level in daily EMA. Moreover, a questionnaire battery assessment is administered at baseline in the first week following onboarding, after five weeks, and after six months.

To address this, web-based physical activity interventions, which have the potential to reach large numbers of users at low costs, have received considerable attention. To fully realise the potential of such interventions, there is a need to further increase their appeal to boost engagement and retention, and sustain intervention effects over longer periods of time. This randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a gamified physical activity intervention that connects users to each other via Facebook and is delivered via a mobile app. METHODS: The study is a three-group, cluster-RCT. Four hundred and forty (440) inactive Australian adults who use Facebook at least weekly will be recruited in clusters of three to eight existing Facebook friends. Participant clusters will be randomly allocated to one of three conditions: (1) waitlist control condition, (2) basic experimental condition (pedometer plus basic app with no social and gamification features), or (3) socially-enhanced experimental condition (pedometer plus app with social and gamification features). Participants will undertake assessments at baseline, three and nine months. The primary outcome is change in total daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at three months measured objectively using GENEActive accelerometers [Activeinsights Ltd., UK]. Secondary outcomes include self-reported physical activity, depression and anxiety, wellbeing, quality of life, social-cognitive theory constructs and app usage and engagement. DISCUSSION: The current study will incorporate novel social and gamification elements in order to examine whether the inclusion of these components increases the efficacy of app-based physical activity interventions. The findings will be used to guide the development and increase the effectiveness of future health behaviour interventions.

10.1093/sleep/zsab280,Randomized controlled trial of digital cognitive behavior therapy for prenatal insomnia symptoms: effects on postpartum insomnia and mental health,"Felder JN, Epel ES, Neuhaus J, Krystal AD, Prather AA.",Sleep,2022,2021.12.1,,,"Comment in Sleep. 2022 May 12;45(5):zsac029. doi: 10.1093/sleep/zsac029. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of digital cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) delivered during pregnancy on subjective sleep outcomes, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms through 6 months postpartum. METHODS: People up to 28 weeks gestation (N = 208) with insomnia were randomized to 6 weekly sessions of dCBT-I or standard care. We report follow-up data at 3 and 6 months postpartum. The primary outcome was insomnia symptom severity. Secondary sleep outcomes included global sleep quality and insomnia caseness. Mental health outcomes included depressive and anxiety symptom severity. We evaluated between-condition differences in change from baseline for each postpartum timepoint and categorical outcomes. RESULTS: dCBT-I participants did not experience significantly greater improvements in insomnia symptom severity relative to standard care participants, but they did experience higher rates of insomnia remission and lower rates of insomnia caseness at 6 months postpartum. dCBT-I participants experienced greater improvements in depressive symptom severity from baseline to both postpartum timepoints, and in anxiety symptom severity from baseline to 3 months postpartum. The proportion of participants with probable major depression at 3 months postpartum was significantly higher among standard care (18%) than dCBT-I (4%, p = 0.006) participants; this between-condition difference was pronounced among the subset (n = 143) with minimal depressive symptoms at baseline (18% vs 0%). CONCLUSION: dCBT-I use during pregnancy leads to enduring benefits for postpartum insomnia remission. Findings provide strong preliminary evidence that dCBT-I use during pregnancy may prevent postpartum depression and anxiety, which is notable when considering the high frequency and importance of these problems.Clinical Trials: ClinicalTrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02805998, NCT02805998."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with incurable cancers (n = 145) who reported elevated anxiety symptoms at two cancer centers were randomized to receive either the CBT mobile app for anxiety or a mobile health education program (control) delivered via tablet computers, which patients self-administered over 12 weeks. To assess anxiety, depression symptoms, and quality of life (QOL), we used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A, primary outcome), Clinical Global Impression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General at baseline and 12 weeks. Analysis of covariance models were calculated to assess intervention effects on patient outcomes. RESULTS: Patients (73.8% female; 91.0% white; mean age = 56.45 years, SD = 11.30) in both study groups reported improvements in anxiety, depression symptoms, and QOL from baseline to postassessment, with no significant differences in any outcome measure between groups. Secondary analyses showed that, among the subgroup of patients with severe baseline anxiety, those randomized to the CBT app had greater improvements on the HAM-A (Mean Difference = 7.44, standard error [SE] = 3.35, p = .037) and HADS-Anxiety Subscale (Mean Difference = 4.44, SE = 1.60, p = .010) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Both the tailored CBT app for anxiety and the health education program were associated with improvements in anxiety, mood, and QOL, but these outcomes did not differ between study groups. The CBT app was more beneficial than health education for patients with severe baseline anxiety. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A cognitive-behavioral therapy mobile application tailored to treat anxiety in patients with advanced cancer helps improve access to evidence-based supportive care in a convenient, private, and timely manner."

The current study evaluated self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms as a potential mediator of the relationship between prior dCBT-I and subsequent insomnia and depressive symptoms assessed during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHOD: Participants were 208 adults who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I versus sleep education in 2016-2017 and also completed self-report assessments of insomnia, depression, and self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms. Data were collected in May 2020, five weeks into state-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the extent to which self-efficacy accounted for the relationship between treatment condition and improvement in insomnia and depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to COVID-19 follow-up. RESULTS: Prior dCBT-I predicted greater self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms. Self-efficacy accounted for 49% and 67% of the protective effect of dCBT-I against COVID-era insomnia and depressive symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study affirms the importance of self-efficacy as a key intervention outcome and potential mechanism by which dCBT-I predicts future sleep and mental health. Future studies that evaluate the role of self-efficacy in treatment effectiveness and resilience can provide additional clues about how to optimize dCBT-I for maximum benefit to public health."

Evidence-based treatment options for depression include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Beyond traditional CBT, over 15 years ago, Hayes proclaimed a new generation of contextualistic and process-orientated so-called third wave of CBT interventions, including acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Using mindfulness and acceptance as well as commitment and behavior change processes, the transdiagnostic ACT approach aims to increase psychological flexibility as universal mechanism of behavior change and to build a value-driven orientation in life. ACT for MDD can be provided as either stand-alone individual, group, or self-help formats (e.g., apps) or combined with other approaches like behavioral activation. To date, a steadily growing empirical support from outcome and process research suggests the efficacy of ACT, which appears to work specifically through the six proposed core processes involved in psychological flexibility, such as defusion. In view of an ongoing interest of clinicians in ""third-wave"" CBTs and the important role of clients' preferences in providing therapy choices that work, the purpose of this chapter is to give a brief overview on the application of ACT in the treatment of MDD in adults."
10.2196/34889,A Digital Mental Health Intervention in an Orthopedic Setting for Patients With Symptoms of Depression and/or Anxiety: Feasibility Prospective Cohort Study,"Leo AJ, Schuelke MJ, Hunt DM, Metzler JP, Miller JP, Areán PA, Armbrecht MA, Cheng AL.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.1.18,,,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain, and when this occurs, standard orthopedic treatment is less effective. However, mental health intervention is not yet a routine part of standard orthopedic treatment, in part because of access-related barriers. Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care. OBJECTIVE: This study's primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in an outpatient orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The secondary purpose was to perform a preliminary effectiveness analysis of the intervention. METHODS: In this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included adult patients (18 years and older) who presented to a nonsurgical orthopedic specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition and who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression and/or Anxiety score ≥55). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a research coordinator immediately after the participant's encounter with an orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile app called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features. For this study, Wysa access also included novel, behavioral activation-based features specifically developed for users with chronic pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined as engagement with a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary effectiveness outcomes were between-group differences in mean longitudinal PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split. RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% (51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61). Compared to low users, high users reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference -4.2 points, 95% CI -8.1 to -0.2; P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group differences in PROMIS Depression (-3.2 points, 95% CI -7.5 to 1.2; P=.15) and Pain Interference scores (-2.3 points, 95% CI -6.3 to 1.7; P=.26) favored high users but did not meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context of orthopedic care is feasible and has the potential to improve mental health and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participants' engagement rates exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to improve recruitment and retention were identified. Further pilot study followed by a definitive, randomized controlled trial is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04640090; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04640090."

This randomized controlled trial evaluated an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online, we recruited 283 adult iPhone(®) (Apple, Cupertino, CA) users with significant depression symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D). They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB); (b) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and acceptance (General SB); or (c) a waiting list control group (WL). The two SB groups were instructed to use SB for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: As hypothesized, SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohen's d=0.67) and by follow-up (d=1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences between SB versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously in light of high attrition rates and the motivated, self-selected sample. Nonetheless, smartphone-based/Internet-based self-help may play an important role in treating depression."

Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between objectively measured PA and MDD treatment outcomes using prospective data. OBJECTIVE: This study is a secondary analysis of data from a 24-week internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for MDD. The purpose of this analysis was twofold: (1) to examine average daily step counts in relation to MDD symptom improvement, and whether pain moderated this relationship; and (2) to examine whether changes in step activity (ie, step trajectories) during treatment were associated with baseline symptoms and symptom improvement. METHODS: Patients from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health were part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of internet-based, mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy for young adults (aged 18-30 years old) with MDD. Data from 20 participants who had completed the intervention were analyzed. PA, in the form of objectively measured steps, was measured using the Fitbit-HR Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc), and self-reported depression severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Linear regression analysis was used to test PA's relationship with depression improvement and the moderating effect of pain severity and pain interference. Growth curve and multivariable regression models were used to test longitudinal associations. RESULTS: Participants walked an average of 8269 steps per day, and each additional +1000-step difference between participants was significantly associated with a 2.66-point greater improvement (reduction) in BDI-II, controlling for anxiety, pain interference, and adherence to Fitbit monitoring (P=.02). Pain severity appeared to moderate (reduce) the positive effect of average daily steps on BDI-II improvement (P=.03). Higher baseline depression and anxiety symptoms predicted less positive step trajectories throughout treatment (Ps≤.001), and more positive step trajectories early in the trial predicted greater MDD improvement at the end of the trial (Ps<.04). However, step trajectories across the full duration of the trial did not significantly predict MDD improvement (Ps=.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study used objective measurements to demonstrate positive associations between PA and depression improvement in the context of cognitive behavioral treatment. Pain appeared to moderate this relationship, and baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted PA trajectories. The findings inform future interventions for major depression. Future research with larger samples should consider additional moderators of PA-related treatment success and the extent to which outcomes are related to PA change in multimodal interventions.

Although opioid maintenance therapy (OMT) has been introduced in Iran, approximately 50% of people with opioid use disorder remain unreached. Moreover, psychosocial treatment of OUD and common mental health symptoms during OMT is limited. Digital interventions have been shown to improve psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. In addition, providing psychoeducation and risk reduction counseling to prevent communicable diseases like HIV and infectious hepatitis is common via the Internet. However, despite these promising advances, no smartphone intervention in OMT has been investigated for the treatment of OUD and common comorbid mental health symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We examine the effectiveness of adding a blended smartphone intervention based on community reinforcement approach, motivational interviewing- and cognitive behavioral therapy compared to OMT as usual that aims to improve OMT outcomes and addresses common mental health symptoms in OMT patients in Iran. METHOD: Adults with opioid dependence entering 8 treatment centers in Tehran, Iran will be randomly assigned to receive either OMT plus a smartphone intervention or OMT as usual. The primary outcomes will be the percentage of negative urine tests for illicit, non-prescribed use of opioids (opium, heroin, tramadol) and treatment retention. Secondary outcomes will include the longest period of abstinence from the illicit, non-prescribed use of opioids (opium, heroin, and tramadol) confirmed by urine samples, changes in communicable disease risk-taking behaviors, changes in stress and common mental health symptoms, and client satisfaction. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and employ (generalized) linear mixed models. DISCUSSION: This study will provide substantial knowledge for designing effective blended interventions for OUD. Moreover, it will investigate if treatment retention and OMT-related outcomes and common mental health symptoms can be improved by adding a smartphone intervention to OMT.

A previous clinical trial suggests that Goal2Quit, a behavioral activation-based smoking cessation mobile app, effectively increases smoking abstinence and reduces depressive symptoms. Objective: Secondary analyses were conducted on these trial data to identify predictors of success in depression-specific digitalized cessation interventions. Methods: Adult who smoked cigarettes (age = 38.4 ± 10.3, 53% women) were randomized to either use Goal2Quit for 12 weeks (N = 103), paired with a 2-week sample of nicotine replacement therapy (patch and lozenge) or to a Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) control (N = 47). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was utilized to identify a subset of baseline variables predicting either smoking or depression intervention outcomes. The retained predictors were then fitted via linear regression models to determine relations to each intervention outcome. Results: Relative to TAU, only individuals who spent significant time using Goal2Quit (56 ± 46 min) were more likely to reduce cigarette use by at least 50% after 12 weeks, whereas those who spent minimal time using Goal2Quit (10 ± 2 min) did not exhibit significant changes. An interaction between educational attainment and treatment group revealed that, as compared to TAU, only app users with an educational degree beyond high school exhibited significant reductions in depression. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of tailoring depression-specific digital cessation interventions to individuals' unique engagement needs and educational level. This study provides a potential methodological template for future research aimed at personalizing technology-based treatments for cigarette users with depressive symptoms."
10.1186/1745-6215-13-62,Behavioral activation-based guided self-help treatment administered through a smartphone application: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Ly KH, Carlbring P, Andersson G.",Trials,2012,2012.5.22,,,"BACKGROUND: The need for cost-effective interventions for people suffering from major depressive disorders is essential. Behavioral activation is an intervention that can largely benefit from the use of new mobile technologies (for example smartphones). Therefore, developing smartphone-based behavioral activation interventions might be a way to develop cost-effective treatments for people suffering from major depressive disorders. The aim of this study will be to test the effects of a smartphone-delivered behavioral activation treatment. METHODS: The study will be a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 120 participants, with 60 patients in each group. The treatment group includes an 8-week smartphone-based behavioral activation intervention, with minimal therapist contact. The smartphone-based intervention consists of a web-based psychoeducation, and a smartphone application. There is also a back-end system where the therapist can see reports from the patients or activities being reported. In the attention control group, we will include brief online education and then recommend use of a smartphone application that is not directly aimed at depression (for example, 'Effective meditation'). The duration of the control condition will also be 8 weeks. For ethical reasons we will give the participants in the control group access to the behavioral activation treatment following the 8-week treatment period. DISCUSSIONS: We believe that this trial has at least three important implications. First, we believe that smartphones can be integrated even further into society and therefore may serve an important role in health care. Second, while behavioral activation is a psychological treatment approach for which there is empirical support, the use of a smartphone application could serve as the therapist's prolonged arm into the daily life of the patient. Third, as we have been doing trials on guided Internet treatment for more than 10 years it is now time to move to the next generation of information technology - smartphones - which are not only relevant for Swedish conditions but also for developing countries in the world which are increasingly empowered by mobile phones with Internet connection.

If and how rumination-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (RFCBT), the gold standard, blocks emotional cascades underlying rumination is unclear. Furthermore, cognitive behavioral therapy has been successfully used as a mobile variant, but RFCBT has not been adapted for a mobile variant (mobile RFCBT [MRFCBT]) or for a JITAI variant. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to pilot-test a fully automated JITAI leveraging RFCBT and ways to identify and block cascading depressive rumination. METHODS: Patients in therapy for clinical depression were recruited for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). After consenting to be part of the RCT, they were randomly assigned to either of the 2 mobile versions of the RFCBT conditions personalized to the individual's rumination timing patterns (JITAI-MRFCBT) or a no-treatment control condition through a double-blind procedure. Although the initial design was to have a 3-armed trial with 2 JITAI conditions (a JITAI and a narrative JITAI condition), we later opted to collapse those 2 conditions into 1 JITAI condition because of the low number of participants. All participants were recruited and participated through their smartphones, receiving 5 SMS text message reminders on each of the 35 days to self-report their rumination-related symptoms (eg, rumination episodes and duration). In the JITAI-MRFCBT condition, they also received treatment materials. The first 7 days provided a rumination baseline, and the last 7 days provided a postintervention rumination value. In total, 42% (25/59) of volunteers were eligible and provided their phone numbers, 20% (5/25) of whom never replied to the SMS text message reminding them to start the RCT. A total of 90% (18/20) of volunteers completed it (ie, finishing, as prespecified, 80% of the questionnaires and training tasks) and, therefore, were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Using independent 2-tailed t tests with bootstrapping, results showed that participants in the JITAI-MRFCBT condition, compared with those in the control condition, reported a greater reduction in counts of rumination episodes (mean -25.28, SD 14.50 vs mean 1.44, SD 4.12, P<.001) and greater reduced average time (minutes) spent in rumination (mean -21.53, SD 17.6 vs mean 1.47, SD 1.5; P=.04). Results also suggest that, compared with those in the control group, those in treatment reduced ruminative carryover from one episode to the next. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that JITAI-MRFCBT may reduce negative rumination by providing RFCBT just in time following rumination, thereby blocking the next rumination episode using the same trigger. This study supports a subsequent, full-scale JITAI and the importance of leveraging mobile smartphone technology with MRFCBT to curb depressive symptoms.

This randomized controlled trial [RCT] evaluated the efficacy of a recently developed mHealth programme based on cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] principles in improving worry and anxiety. We also examined psychological mindedness [PM] as a mediator by which app engagement is thought to improve outcomes. The Intervention group completed a 2-week ""Anxiety and Worry"" programme with daily CBT-informed activities, while the active waitlist-control completed a matched 2-week mHealth programme on procrastination. Participants filled out the Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], and Psychological Mindedness Scale [PMS] at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-week follow-up. App engagement was measured at post-intervention only. Contrary to prediction, the Intervention group did not perform better than the Active Control group; both groups showed significant improvements on anxiety and depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up. From post-intervention to follow-up, only the Intervention group showed further improvements for anxiety symptoms. Higher engagement with the mHealth app predicted lower anxiety and depressive symptoms at follow-up, and this relationship was fully mediated by psychological mindedness. This study provides evidence that [a] engaging in a CBT mHealth programme can reduce anxiety and worry, and [b] Psychological mindedness is a potential pathway by which engaging with a mHealth app improves anxiety and depressive symptoms. While overall effect sizes were small, at the population level, these can make significant contributions to public mental health."
10.2196/44742,Efficacy of a Brief Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety in University Students: Uncontrolled Intervention Study,"Atik E, Stricker J, Schückes M, Pittig A.",JMIR Ment Health,2023,2023.8.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and digital mental health applications-has been increasingly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. As a resource-efficient treatment approach, bCBT appears promising for addressing the growing need for mental health care services, for example, as an early intervention before the chronification of symptoms. However, further research on the efficacy and feasibility of integrated bCBT interventions is needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bCBT program comprising short (25 min), weekly face-to-face therapy sessions combined with a smartphone-based digital health app for treating mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. METHODS: This prospective uncontrolled trial comprised 2 measurement points (before and after treatment) and 2 intervention groups. We recruited university students with mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. On the basis of the primary symptoms, participants were assigned to either a depression intervention group (n=67 completers) or an anxiety intervention group (n=33 completers). Participants in each group received 6 weekly individual psychotherapy sessions via videoconference and completed modules tailored to their respective symptoms in the smartphone-based digital health app. RESULTS: The depression group displayed medium to large improvements in the symptoms of depression (Cohen d=-0.70 to -0.90; P<.001). The anxiety group experienced significant improvements in the symptoms of generalized anxiety assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale with a large effect size (Cohen d=-0.80; P<.001) but not in symptoms of anxiety assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Cohen d=-0.35; P=.06). In addition, both groups experienced significant improvements in their perceived self-efficacy (Cohen d=0.50; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.71; P<.001 in the anxiety group) and quality of life related to psychological health (Cohen d=0.87; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.40; P=.03 in the anxiety group). Work and social adjustment of patients improved significantly in the depression group (Cohen d=-0.49; P<.001) but not in the anxiety group (Cohen d=-0.06; P=.72). Patients' mental health literacy improved in the anxiety group (Cohen d=0.45; P=.02) but not in the depression group (Cohen d=0.21; P=.10). Patient satisfaction with the bCBT program and ratings of the usability of the digital app were high in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a novel brief bCBT intervention. The intervention effects were generalized across a broad spectrum of patient-reported outcomes. Hence, the newly developed bCBT intervention appears promising for treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety in young adults."
10.1186/s13063-016-1740-3,Using a smartphone app to reduce cognitive vulnerability and mild depressive symptoms: Study protocol of an exploratory randomized controlled trial,"Giosan C, Mogoaşe C, Cobeanu O, Szentágotai Tătar A, Mureşan V, Boian R.",Trials,2016,2016.12.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a major challenge worldwide, with significant increasing personal, economic, and societal costs. Although empirically supported treatments have been developed, they are not always available for patients in routine clinical care. Therefore, we need effective and widely accessible strategies to prevent the onset of the very first depressive symptoms. Mental health apps could prove a valuable solution for this desideratum. Although preliminary research has indicated that such apps can be useful in treating depression, no study has attempted to test their utility in preventing depressive symptoms. The aim of this exploratory study is to contrast the efficacy of a smartphone app in reducing cognitive vulnerability and mild depressive symptoms, as risk factors for the onset of depression, against a wait-list condition. More specifically, we aim to test an app designed to (1) decrease general cognitive vulnerability and (2) promote engagement in protective, adaptive activities, while (3) counteracting (through gamification and customization) the tendency of premature dropout from intervention. METHODS/DESIGN: Romanian-speaking adults (18 years and older) with access to a computer and the Internet and who own a smartphone are included in the study. Two parallel randomized clinical trials are conducted: in the first one, 50 participants free of depressive symptoms (i.e., who obtain scores ≤4 on the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) will be included, while in the second one 50 participants with minimal depressive symptoms (i.e., who obtain PHQ-9 scores between 5 and 9) will be included. Participants undergoing therapy, presenting with substance abuse problems, psychotic symptoms, and organic brain disorders, or serious legal or health issues that would prevent them from using the app, as well as participants reporting suicidal ideation are excluded. Participants randomized to the active intervention will autonomously use the smartphone app for 4 weeks, while the others will be given access to the app after 4 weeks from randomization. The primary outcomes are (1) cognitive vulnerability factors as defined within the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) paradigm (i.e., dysfunctional cognitions, irrational beliefs, and negative automatic thoughts) (for the first trial), and (2) level of depressive symptomatology (for the second trial). The app includes self-help materials and exercises based on CBT for depression, presented in a tailored manner and incorporating gamification elements aimed at boosting motivation to use the app. DISCUSSION: This study protocol is the first to capitalize on the ubiquity of smartphones to large-scale dissemination of CBT-based strategies aimed at preventing depression in non-clinical populations.

Prescription digital therapeutics can overcome these barriers. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a specific digital CBT-I therapeutic. Materials & methods:Digital Real-world Evidence trial for Adults with insomnia treated via Mobile (DREAM) is a 9-week, open-label, decentralized clinical trial to collect real-world evidence for a digital therapeutic (Somryst™) delivering CBT-I to patients with chronic insomnia. The primary objective is to examine the effectiveness of Somryst to reduce self-reported insomnia symptoms and severity in a real-world population (n = 350). Conclusion: This pragmatic study seeks to assess the potential benefits of treating insomnia with an asynchronous, mobile, tailored prescription digital therapeutic. Clinical trial registration: NCT04325464 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract Chronic insomnia is linked to a range of health problems, including heart disease, chronic pain, high blood pressure and depression. A behavioral treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the first choice for helping patients overcome insomnia and reduce their risks of insomnia-related problems. Although the benefits of CBT-I have been established, it can be difficult for patients to access trained CBT-I therapists. One possible solution is to use digital forms of CBT-I, which patients can access on mobile devices. Somryst™ is a prescription digital therapeutic, which means it is authorized by the US FDA and has been proven effective in carefully-controlled clinical trials. Less is known, however, about how well the prescription digital therapeutic works in real-world settings. The Digital Real-world Evidence trial for Adults with insomnia treated via Mobile study (DREAM) will explore this question by evaluating a range of symptoms and outcomes in at least 350 patients with chronic insomnia who will use Somryst and be followed for 1 year."

Behavioural activation, an evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment for depression, combined with physical rehabilitation, is a promising intervention. Notably, mHealth applications (Apps) are potentially effective methods of delivering home-based interventions. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of a prototype App to deliver a combined, home-based behavioural activation and rehabilitation intervention to acute respiratory failure survivors. METHODS: A prospective user-preference study was conducted with acute respiratory failure survivors and self-designated care partners. Survivors were adults with at least mild depression symptoms before hospital discharge who received mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit for ≥24 h. Survivors and care partners reviewed the App during a single in-person home visit and completed the System Usability Scale (range: 0-100; score >73 considered ""good"") and a semistructured interview. RESULTS: Ten patient/care partner dyads completed study. The median [interquartile range] patient age was 50 [40-64] years, and 50% were female. The median System Usability Scale scores among patients and care partners were 76 [68-83] and 88 [75-94], respectively. Qualitative feedback supported usability and acceptability of the App, with three themes reported: (1) stigma associated with depression, (2) App as a motivator for recovery, and (3) App providing multidisciplinary support for survivor and care partner. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile App prototype designed to deliver a combined behavioural activation and rehabilitation intervention was usable and acceptable to survivors of acute respiratory failure and their care partners. Given the reported stigma associated with depression, the self-directed App may be particularly valuable for motivation and multidisciplinary support."

To increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment, blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) consisting of web-based and face-to-face treatment is on the rise for patients with MDD. To date, no study has examined whether sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on bCBT treatment outcomes and whether it affects bCBT and treatment-as-usual (TAU) equally. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to investigate whether baseline sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on treatment outcomes independent of treatment modality and whether sleep disturbance symptoms impact bCBT and TAU in routine care equally. METHODS: The study was based on data from the E-COMPARED (European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment Versus Treatment-as-Usual) study, a 2-arm, multisite, parallel randomized controlled, noninferiority trial. A total of 943 outpatients with MDD were randomized to either bCBT (476/943, 50.5%) or TAU consisting of routine clinical MDD treatment (467/943, 49.5%). The primary outcome of this study was the change in depression symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the change in depression symptom severity at the 3- and 6-month follow-up and MDD diagnoses at the 12-month follow-up, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. Mixed effects models were used to examine the association of sleep disturbance symptoms with treatment outcome and treatment modality over time. RESULTS: Of the 943 patients recruited for the study, 558 (59.2%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. In the total sample, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms did not significantly affect change in depressive symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up (β=.16, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.36). However, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms were negatively associated with treatment outcome for bCBT (β=.49, 95% CI 0.22-0.76) but not for TAU (β=-.23, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.05) at the 12-month follow-up, even when adjusting for baseline depression symptom severity. The same result was seen for the effect of sleep disturbance symptoms on the presence of depression measured with Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview at the 12-month follow-up. However, for both treatment formats, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms were not associated with depression symptom severity at either the 3- (β=.06, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.23) or 6-month (β=.09, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.28) follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline sleep disturbance symptoms may have a negative impact on long-term treatment outcomes in bCBT for MDD. This effect was not observed for TAU. These findings suggest that special attention to sleep disturbance symptoms might be warranted when MDD is treated with bCBT. Future studies should investigate the effect of implementing modules specifically targeting sleep disturbance symptoms in bCBT for MDD to improve long-term prognosis."

Thus, this study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of Insomnia Coach, a CBT-I-based, free, self-management mobile app. Fifty U.S. veterans, who were mostly male (58%) and mean age 44.5 (range = 28-55) years with moderate insomnia symptoms were randomized to Insomnia Coach (n = 25) or a wait-list control condition (n = 25) for 6 weeks. Participants completed self-report measures and sleep diaries at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up (12 weeks postrandomization), and app participants (n = 15) completed a qualitative interview at posttreatment. Findings suggest that Insomnia Coach is feasible to use, with three quarters of participants using the app through 6 weeks and engaging with active elements. For acceptability, perceptions of Insomnia Coach were very favorable based on both self-report and qualitative interview responses. Finally, for potential efficacy, at posttreatment, a larger proportion of Insomnia Coach (28%) than wait-list control participants (4%) achieved clinically significant improvement (p = .049) and there was a significant treatment effect on daytime sleep-related impairment (d = -0.6, p = .044). Additional treatment effects emerged at follow-up for insomnia severity (d = -1.1, p = .001), sleep onset latency (d = -0.6, p = .021), global sleep quality (d = -0.9, p = .002), and depression symptoms (d = -0.8, p = .012). These findings provide preliminary evidence that among veterans with moderate insomnia symptoms, a CBT-I-based self-management app is feasible, acceptable, and promising for improving insomnia severity and other sleep-related outcomes. Given the vast unmet need for insomnia treatment in the population, Insomnia Coach may provide an easily accessible, convenient public health intervention for individuals not receiving care."
10.2196/40261,"A Conversational, Virtual, Avatar-Led Cognitive Behavioral Therapy App Intervention for Improving the Quality of Life and Mental Health of People With Epilepsy: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Burbach F, Lecce F, Allen VME, Porter CM.",JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022.11.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting about 1 in 100 people in the United Kingdom. Many individuals experience a lower quality of life as a result of their epilepsy diagnosis and are more likely to develop mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. Medical interventions for this client group tend to focus on the treatment of seizures, whereas mental health disorders often remain undiagnosed and untreated. Early identification and treatment of mental health difficulties in people with epilepsy are vital to ensure better outcomes and improvements in quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this exploratory randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention delivered through a mobile app-ThinkNinja for Epilepsy-is a clinically effective tool to improve quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being in a large sample of people with epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and depression. METHODS: The study aims to recruit 184 individuals, 18 to 65 years of age, with a self-reported diagnosis of epilepsy and anxiety or comorbid anxiety and depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app condition (arm A) or the waiting-list control group (arm B). Participants in arm A will receive access to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app first. After 8 weeks, participants in arm B will receive the same full access to the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy app as the participants in arm A. This design will allow an initial between-subjects analysis between the two conditions as well as a within-subject analysis including all participants. The primary outcome is participants' quality of life, measured by the 10-item patient-weighted Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include measures of anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment; depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; medication adherence, using the Medication Adherence Questionnaire; and impression of change, using the Patient Global Impression of Change questionnaire. RESULTS: Recruitment for this study began in March 2022 and was completed in October 2022. We expect data collection to be finalized by May 2023 and study results to be available within 12 months of the final data collection date. Results of the study will be written up as soon as possible thereafter, with the intention of publishing the outcomes in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the ThinkNinja for Epilepsy intervention at improving the quality of life, mental health, and emotional well-being of people with epilepsy. The findings from our study will hopefully contribute to addressing the critical gap in universal provision and accessibility of mental health and emotional well-being support for people with epilepsy.

The goal of this research was to assess the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral intervention for the prevention of depression, administered to nonprofessional caregivers through a smartphone application (app). One hundred and seventy-five caregivers were randomly assigned to either an app-based cognitive behavioral intervention (CBIA), the CBIA intervention plus a telephone conference call (CBIA + CC), or an attention control group (ACG). At post-intervention, the incidence of depression was lower in the CBIA and CBIA + CC compared to the ACG (1.7% and 0.0% vs. 7.9%, respectively). The absolute risk, relative risk, and number needed to treat compared to the ACG were 6.2%, 21.6%, and 16 for the CBIA, whilst they were 8%, 0.0%, and 13 for the CBIA + CC. Depressive symptomatology was significantly lower in the CBIA and CBIA + CC compared to the ACG (d = 0.84, Cliff's δ = 0.49; d = 1.56, Cliff's δ = 0.72), as well as in the CBIA + CC compared to the CBIA (d = 0.72, Cliff's δ = 0.44). The prevention of depression was more likely in participants who received the CBIA, and adding the conference call in the CBIA + CC group improved the likelihood of this."
10.2196/16525,Apps With Maps-Anxiety and Depression Mobile Apps With Evidence-Based Frameworks: Systematic Search of Major App Stores,"Marshall JM, Dunstan DA, Bartik W.",JMIR Ment Health,2020,2020.6.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Mobile mental health apps have become ubiquitous tools to assist people in managing symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, due to the lack of research and expert input that has accompanied the development of most apps, concerns have been raised by clinicians, researchers, and government authorities about their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to estimate the proportion of mental health apps offering comprehensive therapeutic treatments for anxiety and/or depression available in the app stores that have been developed using evidence-based frameworks. It also aimed to estimate the proportions of specific frameworks being used in an effort to understand which frameworks are having the most influence on app developers in this area. METHODS: A systematic review of the Apple App Store and Google Play store was performed to identify apps offering comprehensive therapeutic interventions that targeted anxiety and/or depression. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist was adapted to guide this approach. RESULTS: Of the 293 apps shortlisted as offering a therapeutic treatment for anxiety and/or depression, 162 (55.3%) mentioned an evidence-based framework in their app store descriptions. Of the 293 apps, 88 (30.0%) claimed to use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, 46 (15.7%) claimed to use mindfulness, 27 (9.2%) claimed to use positive psychology, 10 (3.4%) claimed to use dialectical behavior therapy, 5 (1.7%) claimed to use acceptance and commitment therapy, and 20 (6.8%) claimed to use other techniques. Of the 162 apps that claimed to use a theoretical framework, only 10 (6.2%) had published evidence for their efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The current proportion of apps developed using evidence-based frameworks is unacceptably low, and those without tested frameworks may be ineffective, or worse, pose a risk of harm to users. Future research should establish what other factors work in conjunction with evidence-based frameworks to produce efficacious mental health apps."

Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for bipolar disorder; however, adjunctive psychotherapy can help individuals use self-management strategies to improve outcomes. Yet access to this therapy is limited. Smartphones and other technologies have the potential to increase access to therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while simultaneously providing real-time user feedback and provider alerts to augment care. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the user-centered development of LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for bipolar disorder, to contribute to and support the ongoing improvement and dissemination of technology-based mental health interventions. METHODS: Individuals with bipolar disorder first participated in a field trial of a simple smartphone app for self-monitoring of behavioral targets. To develop a complete technology-based intervention for bipolar disorder, this field trial was followed by design sessions, usability testing, and a pilot study of a smartphone-based self-management intervention for bipolar disorder. Throughout all phases of development, intervention revisions were made based on user feedback. RESULTS: The core of the LiveWell intervention consists of a daily self-monitoring tool, the Daily Check-in. This self-monitoring tool underwent multiple revisions during the user-centered development process. Daily Check-in mood and thought rating scales were collapsed into a single wellness rating scale to accommodate user development of personalized scale anchors. These anchors are meant to assist users in identifying early warning signs and symptoms of impending episodes to take action based on personalized plans. When users identified personal anchors for the wellness scale, the anchors most commonly reflected behavioral signs and symptoms (40%), followed by cognitive (25%), mood (15%), physical (10%), and motivational (7%) signs and symptoms. Changes to the Daily Check-in were also made to help users distinguish between getting adequate sleep and keeping a regular routine. At the end of the pilot study, users reported that the Daily Check-in made them more aware of early warning signs and symptoms and how much they were sleeping. Users also reported that they liked personalizing their anchors and plans and felt this process was useful. Users experienced some difficulties with developing, tracking, and achieving target goals. Users also did not consistently follow up with app recommendations to contact providers when Daily Check-in data suggested they needed additional assistance. As a result, the human support roles for the technology were expanded beyond app use support to include support for self-management and clinical care communication. The development of these human support roles was aided by feedback on the technology's usability from the users and the coaches who provided the human support. CONCLUSIONS: User input guided the development of intervention content, technology, and coaching support for LiveWell. Users valued the provision of monitoring tools and the ability to personalize plans for staying well, supporting the role of monitoring and personalization as important features of digital mental health technologies. Users also valued human support of the technology in the form of a coach, and user difficulties with aspects of self-management and care-provider communication led to an expansion of the coach's support roles. Obtaining feedback from both users and coaches played an important role in the development of both the LiveWell technology and human support. Attention to all stakeholders involved in the use of mental health technologies is essential for optimizing intervention development."

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the dominant approach, as six DiHA focus on CBT, featuring common components like managing unwanted thoughts, behavioral activation, and relaxation. However, only three apps include cognitive restructuring, a key aspect of CBT. There is a lack of DiHA for alternative therapy methods like depth psychology, limiting options for patients seeking different approaches. The analysis also found fragmented information on app components, suggesting a need for centralizing comprehensive data in the official DiHA directory for better decision-making."

Digitally-delivered evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) may provide an opportunity to improve access and engagement in mental health care. We present a case study that reviews lessons learned from using the Discover - Design - Build - Test (DDBT) model to create, develop, and evaluate a high-fidelity prototype of an app to deliver an EBPI for depression, behavioral activation (BA), on an Asynchronous Remote Communities (ARC) platform (referred to as ActivaTeen). We review work at each stage of the DDBT framework, including initial formative work, iterative design and development work, and an initial feasibility study. We engaged teens with depression, mental health clinicians, and expert evaluators through the process. We found that the DDBT model supported the research team in understanding the requirements for our prototype system, ActivaTeen, and conceiving of and developing specific ideas for implementation. Our work contributes a case study of how the DDBT framework can be applied to adapting an EBPI to a new, scalable and digital format.

METHODS: Female breast cancer patients (n = 70) with ongoing or finished oncological treatment that is who were receiving or had received any type of oncological treatment were included in the study and randomized to an intervention group (IG, n = 32) receiving Living Well in addition to care as usual, and a control group (CG, n = 38) receiving care as usual only. Participants completed standardized questionnaires at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks to assess anxiety and depression (HADS) as primary outcomes, distress (DT), health-related quality of life (HRQoL, AQoL-8D), and illness perception (B-IPQ) as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, significant (p < 0.05) higher improvements in the IG could be observed in anxiety levels, HRQoL, and illness perception, when compared to the CG. Age and time since diagnosis were found to be relevant covariates for anxiety levels. In distress levels, the IG showed a clinically relevant and nearly significant reduction compared to the CG (p = 0.057). No effects could be observed in depression levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the potential of Living Well to improve psychological outcomes of female breast cancer patients and encourage further studies evaluating the effectiveness of the digital application. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00029918)."
10.1002/eat.23891,A pilot randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral therapy guided self-help mobile app for the post-acute treatment of anorexia nervosa: A registered report,"Fitzsimmons-Craft EE, Laboe AA, McGinnis C, Firebaugh ML, Shah J, Wallendorf M, Jacobi C, Bardone-Cone AM, Pike KM, Taylor CB, Wilfley DE.",Int J Eat Disord,2023,2023.1.7,,,"INTRODUCTION: Relapse following acute treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) is common. Evidence suggests cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be useful in the post-acute period, but few patients have access to trained providers. mHealth technologies have potential to increase access to high-quality care for AN, including in the post-acute period. The aim of this study is to estimate the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU), offered with and without an accompanying social networking feature. METHOD: In the current pilot randomized controlled trial, women with AN who have been discharged from acute treatment in the past 2 months (N = 90) will be randomly assigned to a CBT-based mobile intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU), a CBT-based mobile intervention including social networking plus TAU, or TAU alone. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the three conditions in terms of reducing eating disorder psychopathology, reducing frequency of eating disorder behaviors, achieving weight maintenance, reducing depression and suicidal ideation, and reducing clinical impairment. We will examine rehospitalization and full recovery rates in an exploratory fashion. We will also examine whether the mobile intervention and social networking feature change the proposed targets and whether changes in targets are associated with benefit, as well as conduct exploratory analyses to identify within-mobile intervention predictors and moderators of outcome. DISCUSSION: Ultimately, this research may lead to increased access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with AN and prevention of the extreme negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Relapse after acute treatment for anorexia nervosa is common, and few patients have access to trained providers to support them following acute care. This study will pilot a coached mobile app, including a social networking component, for this population. If ultimately successful, our approach could greatly increase access to evidence-based treatment for individuals with anorexia nervosa and ultimately prevent the extreme negative consequences that can result from this serious disorder."

U.S. Latino/as are most likely to report depressive symptoms to primary care physicians, who often have limited resources for providing evidence-based psychological depression treatment. This limited treatment accessibility is further compounded by additional treatment barriers, including stigma related to seeking mental health treatment and limited English proficiency. Mobile technologies, including smartphones and mobile applications (apps) delivered via smartphone, are promising for addressing this treatment need. Herein, we discuss the development of a Spanish-language brief behavioral activation mobile application, ¡Aptívate!, that was developed to disseminate depression-based psychological treatment via primary care to Spanish-speaking Latino/as.

We conducted a pilot implementation-effectiveness trial of a scalable treatment package that consisted of a single (telehealth) workshop plus a companion app that provided ecological momentary intervention. Participants (n = 177) received a workshop provided by counseling center staff and trainees. We were interested in (1) engagement with the app, (2) acceptability of the treatment package, and (3) initial effectiveness of the treatment package. Regarding engagement with the app, we found that participants preferred two reminder prompts per day and identified two key breakpoints when engagement declined significantly: at day 15, when just over half of the sample practiced a skill on the app at least once during the day and at day 41, when just over one third of people practiced a skill on the app each day. Regarding acceptability of the treatment package, students generally reported positive attitudes about the single-session workshop and app, but also noted that the content and assessments in the app needed to be more dynamic to improve how engaging it is. Regarding effectiveness, we found that about 75% of the sample experienced a significant reduction in negative affect from pre- to post-ecological momentary intervention. Moreover, there were significant pre- to post-study decreases in experiential avoidance and symptoms of anxiety and depression and increases in self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. The results of this study are promising in terms of providing initial support for this novel treatment package and provide useful information for researchers planning to develop and test similar interventions."

However, evidence-based cessation programs are rarely implemented in oncology care, and smoking is not consistently treated in cancer treatment settings. Consequently, there is an urgent need for accessible and efficacious cessation treatments that are uniquely tailored to the needs of cancer patients. Here we describe the design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of a smartphone app (Quit2Heal) versus a US Clinical Practice Guidelines-based app (QuitGuide) for smoking cessation among a planned sample of 422 cancer patients. Quit2Heal is designed to address cancer-related shame, stigma, depression, anxiety, and knowledge about the consequences of smoking/quitting. Quit2Heal is based on the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a behavioral therapy that teaches skills for accepting cravings to smoke without smoking, values-driven motivation to quit, and preventing relapse. The primary aim of the RCT is to determine whether Quit2Heal has significantly higher self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months relative to QuitGuide. The trial will also determine whether Quit2Heal's effect on cessation is (1) mediated by improvements in cancer-related shame, stigma, depression, anxiety, and knowledge about the consequences of smoking/quitting; and (2) moderated by baseline factors (e.g., cancer type, stage, time since diagnosis). If successful, Quit2Heal will offer a more efficacious, broadly scalable smoking cessation treatment that could be implemented alongside existing oncology care, thereby improving cancer outcomes."

Moreover, human resources to deliver such treatments are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based intervention with adherence-focused guidance in the treatment of sD. Participants with sD (CES-D≥ 16, no Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria, N = 204) recruited via a large health insurance were randomly allocated to a web-based mobile-supported cognitive-behavioral intervention or to a waitlist control condition with unrestricted access to usual care. The primary outcome was the reduction in depressive symptom severity as measured by blind diagnostic raters using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) at posttreatment. There was a statistically significant between-group difference in QIDS scores at posttreatment in favor of the intervention group, F(1, 201) = 11.31, p = .001, corresponding to a medium effect size of d = 0.37 (95% CI 0.09-0.64) and a NNT of 7 (95%-CI 3.7-41.2). Significant effects in favour of the intervention group were also found for secondary outcomes such as quality of life, anxiety, and insomnia severity. Web-based self-help interventions with adherence-focused guidance could be an acceptable and effective approach to reduce a range of negative consequences associated with subclinical depression."
10.2147/PRBM.S511833,"Interaction Among Smartphone Addiction, Behavioral Inhibition/Activation Systems and Mental Health Factors Among Chinese Undergraduate Student: A Study Using Network Analysis","Zhang M, Wang X, Zhang B.",Psychol Res Behav Manag,2025,2025.4.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Smartphone addiction, which represents a behavioral concern, has been found to correlate with a diverse range of mental health problems among the undergraduate students. Meanwhile, the modes of behavioral inhibition/activation showed specific characteristics in smartphone addiction individuals. Therefore, clarifying the interaction of mental health and behavioral modes with smartphone addiction is urgent. Here, we used a cross-sectional design, aiming to explore the network interactions among smartphone addiction, mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness and life satisfaction), and the behavioral inhibition/activation system (BIS/BAS) in undergraduate students. METHODS: We employed network analysis and community detection in R, to investigate the centrality and edge connections, which are the mainly index of key factors and interaction effects between factors respectively. The study was carried out among 701 participants with an average age of 18.27 ± 1.57 years old, all of whom had completed self-report scales. RESULTS: The network analysis results suggested that depression and anxiety, the behavioral activation of fun seeking, reward responsiveness and behavioral inhibition had significantly higher centrality than the other mental health and BIS/BAS factors respectively. When combining the connections of network analysis and community detection, the stronger connections mainly present in the inner domain of mental health factors and the BIS/BAS, respectively. The findings regarding the transdomain connections imply that stress is likely to serve as a mediator in the relationships between smartphone addiction and both depression as well as BAS-Drive. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the current study suggests that although common psychological and behavioral system problems may play a dominant role in smartphone addiction among undergraduate students, it is still necessary to consider whether other factors such as stress may play a potential moderating role. The new insight will help to enhance mental health and facilitating proper smartphone use management to avoid the aggravation of addiction problems among undergraduate student."

The Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (MBAT) has been verified to be effective among rural older adults in China. Due to its structured format and skill-based learning, it is well suited for digital-based delivery. However, only a few studies were from developed countries, and the evidence to support its application in rural China still needs to be provided. Thus, based on the fact that digital health technology has the potential to address the shortage of healthcare resources and the constraints of community mental health services in rural China, the effectiveness of the digital MBAT (D-MBAT) program among rural older adults is worth further evaluation. METHODS: A multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 216 rural older adults from Huayuan County and Fenghuang County in Western Hunan. The intervention group will receive the D-MBAT program, while the control group will receive routine care. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, social health, quality of life, and satisfaction will be measured at baseline, one-month, and three-month follow-ups to evaluate the digital MBAT program's effectiveness. DISCUSSION: Existing digital psychological intervention strategies seldom take into account the needs and preferences of the older adults in low-resource rural areas. Thus, this study aims to develop a D-MBAT program based on person-centered and community-engaged approach to maximize the mental health service of rural older adults with depressive symptoms.A successful D-MBAT program would be a feasible and scalable approach to the management of prevalent mental health conditions of rural older adults in resource-limited Western Hunan.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore the range of digital mental health interventions available for young people aged 16-25 years, with a particular focus on digital tool types, modalities, delivery formats, target populations, and study retention rates. METHODS: The scoping review was conducted in 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsychInfo). Studies were included if they were published from 2019 to 2024 in English, reported on a population of young people aged 16-25 years, and included validated mental health or well-being outcome measures. All types of digital interventions from promotion and prevention to treatment of mental health were included. RESULTS: After screening 13,306 articles, 145 articles were included in the final review. The findings reveal a diverse landscape of studies, equally focusing on the prevention and promotion of mental health and the treatment of mental ill health, most commonly using cognitive behavioral therapy (63/145, 43.4%). The most common digital tools were apps (51/135, 37.8%), web-based resources (45/135, 33.3%), and websites (19/135, 14.1%). The results highlight the over emphasis on convenience sampling (140/145, 96.6%), with participants mainly recruited from universities or colleges, and a lack of representation from marginalized groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth; those from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds; and those who are neurodivergent. Moreover, the focus on anxiety and depression leaves other mental health conditions underrepresented. Retention rates ranged from 16% to 100% and averaged 66% across all studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more research on mental health promotion and prevention measures among those aged younger than 25 years as young people are at increased risk of mental health issues. This includes exploring different intervention approaches and modalities beyond cognitive behavioral therapy and ensuring inclusivity in study populations. Standardizing intervention durations and incorporating long-term follow-up data could provide valuable insights into the efficacy and effectiveness of digital interventions. Future studies should aim for greater inclusivity, ensuring representation from marginalized groups to address the diverse mental health needs of young people effectively. By adopting these approaches, digital mental health interventions can become more accessible, engaging, and impactful for young people worldwide."

Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case analyses. Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive symptoms (d = -0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (d = -0.52) and anxiety symptoms (d = -0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop iNNOV Breast Cancer (iNNOVBC), a guided, internet-delivered, individually tailored, acceptance and commitment therapy-influenced cognitive behavioral intervention program aiming to treat mild to moderate anxiety and depression in BCSs as well as to improve fatigue, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and health-related quality of life in this group. This study also aims to evaluate the usefulness, usability, and preliminary feasibility of iNNOVBC. METHODS: iNNOVBC was developed using a user-centered design approach involving its primary and secondary end users, that is, BCSs (11/24, 46%) and mental health professionals (13/24, 54%). We used mixed methods, namely in-depth semistructured interviews, laboratory-based usability tests, short-term field trials, and surveys, to assess iNNOVBC's usefulness, usability, and preliminary feasibility among these target users. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample, evaluate performance data, and assess survey responses. Qualitative data were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, participants considered iNNOVBC highly useful, with most participants reporting on the pertinence of its scope, the digital format, the relevant content, and the appropriate features. However, various usability issues were identified, and participants suggested that the program should be refined by simplifying navigation paths, using a more dynamic color scheme, including more icons and images, displaying information in different formats and versions, and developing smartphone and tablet versions. In addition, participants suggested that tables should be converted into plain textboxes and data visualization dashboards should be included to facilitate the tracking of progress. The possibility of using iNNOVBC in a flexible manner, tailoring it according to BCSs' changing needs and along the cancer care continuum, was another suggestion that was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that iNNOVBC is considered useful by both BCSs and mental health professionals, configuring a promising point-of-need solution to bridge the psychological supportive care gap experienced by BCSs across the survivorship trajectory. We believe that our results may be applicable to other similar programs. However, to fulfill their full supportive role, such programs should be comprehensive, highly usable, and tailorable and must adopt a flexible yet integrated structure capable of evolving in accordance with survivors' changing needs and the cancer continuum."
10.1155/da/2171041,Digital CBT-I in Comorbid Insomnia and Depression: Clinical Outcomes From a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial,"Schuffelen J, Maurer LF, Gieselmann A.",Depress Anxiety,2025,2025.6.3,,,"Depression affects 8.1% of the German population annually, yet many patients remain resistant to conventional treatments. Given that 85% of individuals with depression also experience chronic insomnia, sleep may represent both a contributing and modifiable treatment factor. This study examines whether adding a fully automated digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) to care-as-usual (CAU) improves depressive symptoms. Participants with comorbid depression and insomnia were randomized to either the intervention group (dCBT-I) or the waiting group (WLC). The intervention was delivered via a mobile app or web platform, consisting of 10 sequential core modules based on evidence-based CBT-I techniques. Assessments took place at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks post randomization. The primary outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes included insomnia severity, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, well-being and mechanistic effect measures. Linear mixed models were calculated to determine between-group effects. A total of 140 participants (120 women, mean age: M = 39.76 ± 11.65 years) were randomized to dCBT-I (n=70) or WLC (n=70). Large treatment effects at 12- and 24 weeks showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms (-3.34 and -2.83; ps <0.001; ds = 0.66-0.78) in the dCBT-I group. Treatment effects in favor of dCBT-I were also found for insomnia severity (ds = 1.46-1.94) and most secondary outcomes (ds = 0.33-1.14). This study demonstrates that digital dCBT-I can be effective not only for individuals with primary insomnia but also for those with depression. These findings align with previous research, highlighting the crucial role of sleep disturbances in depression management. Moreover, the effects remained stable even in the heterogeneous sample investigated in this study, reinforcing the robustness of dCBT-I across diverse patient groups. Thus, dCBT-I emerges as a promising adjunctive treatment. Considering these findings, it is essential to explore the integration of sleep-focused interventions into standard depression treatment.

BACKGROUND: Internet-cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression can include multiple components. This study explored depressive symptom improvement prognostic factors (PFs) and effect modifiers (EMs) for five common iCBT components including behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, self-monitoring, and assertion training. METHODS: We used data from a factorial trial of iCBT for subthreshold depression among Japanese university students (N = 1093). The primary outcome was the change in PHQ-9 scores at 8 weeks from baseline. Interactions between each component and various baseline characteristics were estimated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. We calculated multiplicity-adjusted p-values at 5 % false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. RESULTS: After multiplicity adjustment, the baseline PHQ-9 total score emerged as a PF and exercise habits as an EM for self-monitoring (adjusted p-values <0.05). The higher the PHQ-9 total score at baseline (range: 5-14), the greater the decrease after 8 weeks. For each 5-point increase at baseline, the change from baseline to 8 weeks was bigger by 2.8 points. The more frequent the exercise habits (range: 0-2 points), the less effective the self-monitoring component. The difference in PHQ-9 change scores between presence or absence of self-monitoring was smaller by 0.94 points when the participant exercised one level more frequently. Additionally, the study suggested seven out of 36 PFs and 14 out of 160 EMs examined were candidates for future research. LIMITATIONS: Generalizability is limited to university students with subthreshold depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide some helpful information for the future development of individualized iCBT algorithms for depression."
10.2196/29014,Comparing the Effectiveness of Education Versus Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: Protocol for the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications (CaRISMA) Study,"Badawy SM, Abebe KZ, Reichman CA, Checo G, Hamm ME, Stinson J, Lalloo C, Carroll P, Saraf SL, Gordeuk VR, Desai P, Shah N, Liles D, Trimnell C, Jonassaint CR.",JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021.5.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience significant medical and psychological stressors that affect their mental health, well-being, and disease outcomes. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in other patient populations and has demonstrated clinical benefits. Although evidence-based, nonpharmacological interventions for pain management are widely used in other populations, these treatments have not been well studied in SCD. Currently, there are no adequately powered large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and dissemination potential of behavioral pain management for adults with SCD. Furthermore, some important details regarding behavioral therapies in SCD remain unclear-in particular, what works best for whom and when. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of two smartphone-delivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms: digital CBT versus pain and SCD education (Education). Our secondary goal is to assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. We hypothesize that digital CBT will confer greater benefits on pain outcomes and depressive symptoms at 6 months and a greater reduction in health care use (eg, opioid prescriptions or refills or acute care visits) over 12 months. METHODS: The CaRISMA (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications) study is a multisite comparative effectiveness trial funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. CaRISMA is conducted at six clinical academic sites, in partnership with four community-based organizations. CaRISMA will evaluate the effectiveness of two 12-week health coach-supported digital health programs with a total of 350 participants in two groups: CBT (n=175) and Education (n=175). Participants will complete a series of questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome will be the change in pain interference between the study arms. We will also evaluate changes in pain intensity, depressive symptoms, other patient-reported outcomes, and health care use as secondary outcomes. We have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.37 SDs between study arms on 6-month changes in the outcomes with 15% expected attrition at 6 months. An exploratory analysis will examine whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of the intervention on pain interference. RESULTS: This study will be conducted from March 2021 through February 2022, with results expected to be available in February 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCD experience significant disease burden, psychosocial stress, and impairment of their quality of life. CaRISMA proposes to leverage digital technology and overcome barriers to the routine use of behavioral treatments for pain and depressive symptoms in the treatment of adults with SCD. The study will provide data on the comparative effectiveness of digital CBT and Education approaches and evaluate the potential for implementing evidence-based behavioral interventions to manage SCD pain.

Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non-specific intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of depression (CES-D ≥ 16) of a large distance-learning university were randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress intervention group (IG; n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program of equal length. Self-report data was assessed at baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks) and three-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found significant between-group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.08-0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30-0.91), perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18-0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.03-0.67) and other secondary outcomes post-treatment. Effects on depression were sustained at three-month follow-up. Response rates for depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post-test (χ 2=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three-month follow-up (p = 0.454). We also found significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment (follow-up; d = 0.36), work output (post-treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback (follow-up; d = 0.36). The intervention was more effective for depressive symptoms compared to the CG, and so controlling for unspecific intervention effects. This suggests that specific techniques of the intervention may provide significant additional benefits on depressive symptoms.

Adolescents and young adults, being at risk of depressive symptoms and leading mobile users, are among the main targets of using mobile applications to alleviate symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of mobile application-based psychological interventions in reducing depression symptoms in adolescents and young adults compared to those not exposed to the intervention. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis focusing on mobile applications for reducing depressive symptoms. We searched two databases: MEDLINE and EMBASE and included randomized controlled trials conducted in English among participants aged 18-35 years old who were assessed for depressive symptoms using a validated screening measure and used mobile applications-based psychological interventions. Two of six independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. A pooled mean standardized difference (Cohen's d) and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using I2 statistics and forest plot. Egger's test was used for assessing publication bias. RESULTS: After screening 740 references, we identified 12 trials with 1869 participants, with a mean age of participants ranging from 14.70 to 25.1 years. The interventions ranged from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile apps to interactive story-telling apps and apps delivering a mix of CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents, and dialectical behavior therapy elements. Control groups included information-only, waitlist, no intervention, and treatment as usual. Seven studies used Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess the severity of depressive symptoms, while the other five used different scales. There was no evidence of publication bias (p = 0.325). The mobile applications reduced depression score by 0.08 units of standardized difference more than the control, with a 95% CI of -0.19 to 0.03 (p = 0.294, I2 = 15.4%) using standardized mean difference (SMD) as the effect estimate. In a sensitivity analysis including only studies that used PHQ-9, we found a similar trend, SMD -0.72 (95%CI -1.48 to 0.03). However, both findings were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to support mobile applications to relieve depression symptoms in adolescents and young adults. Further trials with larger sample size are needed to confirm our findings of a positive trend. With emerging technologies and the high exposure of apps in this population, mobile applications for depression hold promise for the future of treatment and awareness of mental health disorders in this population."
10.2196/44940,A Relational Agent Intervention for Adolescents Seeking Mental Health Treatment: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Chiauzzi E, Robinson A, Martin K, Petersen C, Wells N, Williams A, Gleason MM.",JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023.3.3,,,"BACKGROUND: Unmet pediatric mental health (MH) needs are growing as rates of pediatric depression and anxiety dramatically increase. Access to care is limited by multiple factors, including a shortage of clinicians trained in developmentally specific, evidence-based services. Novel approaches to MH care delivery, including technology-leveraged and readily accessible options, need to be evaluated in service of expanding evidence-based services to youths and their families. Preliminary evidence supports the use of Woebot, a relational agent that digitally delivers guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through a mobile app, for adults with MH concerns. However, no studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of such app-delivered relational agents specifically for adolescents with depression and/or anxiety within an outpatient MH clinic, nor compared them to other MH support services. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of an investigational device, Woebot for Adolescents (W-GenZD), within an outpatient MH clinic for youths presenting with depression and/or anxiety. The study's secondary aim will compare the clinical outcomes of self-reported depressive symptoms with W-GenZD and a telehealth-delivered CBT-based skills group (CBT-group). Tertiary aims will evaluate additional clinical outcomes and therapeutic alliance between adolescents in W-GenZD and the CBT-group. METHODS: Participants include youths aged 13-17 years with depression and/or anxiety seeking care from an outpatient MH clinic at a children's hospital. Eligible youths will have no recent safety concerns or complex comorbid clinical diagnoses; have no concurrent individual therapy; and, if on medications, are on stable doses, based on clinical screening and as well as study-specific criteria. RESULTS: Recruitment began in May 2022. As of December 8, 2022, we have randomized 133 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing the feasibility and acceptability of W-GenZD within an outpatient MH clinical setting will add to the field's current understanding of the utility and implementation considerations of this MH care service modality. The study will also evaluate the noninferiority of W-GenZD against the CBT-group. Findings may also have implications for patients, families, and providers looking for additional MH support options for adolescents seeking help for their depression and/or anxiety. Such options expand the menu of supports for youths with lower-intensity needs as well as possibly reduce waitlists and optimize clinician deployment toward more severe cases.

Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents. METHOD: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the `app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention.

10.2196/14146,Engagement and Usability of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App Compared With Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Among College Students: Randomized Heuristic Trial,"Purkayastha S, Addepally SA, Bucher S.",JMIR Hum Factors,2020,2020.2.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence in mobile health has demonstrated that, in some cases, apps are an effective way to improve health care delivery. Health care interventions delivered via mobile technology have demonstrated both practicality and affordability. Lately, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions delivered over the internet have also shown a meaningful impact on patients with anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: Given the growing proliferation of smartphones and the trust in apps to support improved health behaviors and outcomes, we were interested in comparing a mobile app with Web-based methods for the delivery of CBT. This study aimed to compare the usability of a CBT mobile app called MoodTrainer with an evidence-based website called MoodGYM. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to recruit 30 students from a large Midwestern university and randomly assigned them to either the MoodGYM or MoodTrainer user group. The trial period ran for 2 weeks, after which the students completed a self-assessment survey based on Nielsen heuristics. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the survey results from the 2 groups. We also compared the number of modules attempted or completed and the time spent on CBT strategies. RESULTS: The results indicate that the MoodTrainer app received a higher usability score when compared with MoodGYM. Overall, 87% (13/15) of the participants felt that it was easy to navigate through the MoodTrainer app compared with 80% (12/15) of the MoodGYM participants. All MoodTrainer participants agreed that the app was easy to use and did not require any external assistance, whereas only 67% (10/15) had the same opinion for MoodGYM. Furthermore, 67% (10/15) of the MoodTrainer participants found that the navigation controls were easy to locate compared with 80% (12/15) of the MoodGYM participants. MoodTrainer users, on average, completed 2.5 modules compared with 1 module completed by MoodGYM users. CONCLUSIONS: As among the first studies to directly compare the usability of a mobile app-based CBT with smartphone-specific features against a Web-based CBT, there is an opportunity for app-based CBT as, at least in our limited trial, it was more usable and engaging. The study was limited to evaluate usability only and not the clinical effectiveness of the app."
10.1186/s13063-020-04778-1,Treating depression with a smartphone-delivered self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: study protocol for a parallel group randomized controlled trial,"Hui VK, Wong CY, Ma EK, Ho FY, Chan CS.",Trials,2020,2020.10.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a major public health concern. Emerging research has shown that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in treating individuals with comorbid insomnia and depression. Traditional face-to-face CBT-I encounters many obstacles related to feasibility, accessibility, and help-seeking stigma. CBT-I delivered via smartphone application could be a potential solution. This paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the efficacy of a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I, using a waitlist group as control, for people with major depression and insomnia. METHODS: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial is conducted in a target sample of 285 non-suicidal Hong Kong Chinese older than 17 years of age with major depression and insomnia. Participants complete an online rapid screening, followed by a telephone diagnostic interview. Those who meet the eligibility criteria are randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either CBT-I immediately or to a waitlist control condition. The CBT-I consists of six weekly modules and is delivered through a smartphone application proACT-S. This smartphone app has been pilot tested and revamped to improve user experience. An online randomized algorithm is used to perform randomization to ensure allocation concealment. The primary outcomes are changes over the measurement points in sleep quality, insomnia severity, and depression severity. The secondary outcomes include changes over the measurement points in anxiety, subjective health, treatment expectancy, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments are administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-week follow-up. The recruitment is completed. Important adverse events, if any, are documented. Multilevel linear mixed model based on intention-to-treat principle will be conducted to examine the efficacy of the CBT-I intervention. DISCUSSION: It is expected that proACT-S is an efficacious brief sleep-focused self-help treatment for people with major depression and insomnia. If proven efficacious, due to its self-help nature, proACT-S may be applicable as a community-based early intervention, thereby reducing the burden of the public healthcare system in Hong Kong.

Prolonged exposure (PE) is an efficacious treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PE Coach is a treatment companion app that may increase patient engagement with the active components of PE, thereby supporting recovery. METHODS: This paper describes a randomized clinical trial that will evaluate PE delivered with and without PE Coach at post-treatment, and 1-month and 4-months post-treatment. Veterans with PTSD (N = 124) will be randomized (1:1) to conditions and complete up to 15 treatment sessions based on a priori defined termination criteria. We hypothesize that compared to PE without PE Coach, PE with the app will result in greater improvements in PTSD-related social and occupational functioning (primary outcome is the PTSD-Related Functioning Inventory), quality of life, and greater reductions in functional impairment, neurobehavioral symptoms, depression, and suicidal ideation (Aim 1). We also hypothesize that including PE Coach will reduce assessor-masked PTSD symptom severity, relative to PE without the app, as assessed by the revised Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (Aim 2). We hypothesize that PE Coach will facilitate increased treatment adherence, as measured by completion of PE homework (Aim 3). We will explore the impact of PE Coach on treatment engagement, as measured by reduced treatment dropout. CONCLUSION: Data on the outcomes of PE Coach can inform dissemination efforts and help evaluate the return on investment to guide future mental health app development.

10.1016/j.invent.2023.100649,Feasibility and efficacy of a digital resilience training: A pilot study of the strengths-based training RESIST,"Behrendt D, Boß L, Hannibal S, Kunzler AM, Wessa M, Lehr D.",Internet Interv,2023,2023.8.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Work-related stress is a risk factor for a number of adverse health and work outcomes. Resilience trainings are a promising approach for adequately dealing with work stress and keeping employees mentally healthy. However, results of previous resilience trainings have been heterogeneous, ranging from null findings to large effects. Existing digital resilience interventions show a lack of consistency in terms of an underlying theoretical framework and methods used to foster resilience. Positive Appraisal Style Theory of Resilience offers an innovative conceptualization of resilience. Strengths-based cognitive behavioral therapy is a corresponding therapeutically method reflecting resilience as a resource-oriented process of dealing with stress. Based on this background, a new hybrid web-and app-based digital resilience intervention for employees named RESIST was developed. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of the newly developed training RESIST regarding its usability, user behavior, user experience and motivation to use. Second, the study sought to explore preliminary effects of the intervention on reducing stress and enhancing resilience by conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The feasibility study was conducted in three phases. First, the usability of the app was investigated in a pre-test with five participants using a thinking-aloud method. Second, the preliminary efficacy of the training was examined in a pilot randomized controlled trial. A sample of 30 employees were randomized either to receive the resilience training (n = 15) or to be member of a control group (n = 15). The primary outcome was measuring perceived stress. Secondary outcomes included measures of resilience and depressive symptoms. Third, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with six participants of the resilience training group on training content, motivation for use, and user experience. RESULTS: Overall, results indicate that RESIST can be a feasible training for resilience promotion and stress reduction with high user satisfaction. Analysis of covariance showed that, relative to controls, participants who received RESIST reported significantly lower stress scores at post-intervention (F1,27 = 16.91, p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.57; 95 % CI 0.71-2.43) than controls. Significant differences, with moderate-to-large effect sizes, were also detected for general resilience and various resilience factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results are promising and provide hope that a hybrid web- and app-based resilience intervention based on strengths-based cognitive behavioral therapy can have a positive impact on dealing adequately with stress and improve resilience of employees."

Recent years have seen a surge in digital interventions to bridge this treatment gap. Most of these interventions are based on computerized cognitive behavioral therapy. Despite the efficacy of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions, their uptake is low and dropout rates are high. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigms provide a complementary approach to digital interventions for depression. However, interventions based on CBM paradigms have been reported to be repetitive and boring. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we described the conceptualization, design, and acceptability of serious games based on CBM paradigms and the learned helplessness paradigm. METHODS: We searched the literature for CBM paradigms that were shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. For each of the CBM paradigms, we ideated how to create a game so that the gameplay was engaging while the active therapeutic component remained unchanged. RESULTS: We developed 5 serious games based on the CBM paradigms and the learned helplessness paradigm. The games include various core elements of gamification, such as goals, challenges, feedback, rewards, progress, and fun. Overall, the games received positive acceptability ratings from 15 users. CONCLUSIONS: These games may help improve the effectiveness and engagement levels of computerized interventions for depression."

Unfortunately, effective weight management in this vulnerable population has significant barriers. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the feasibility and preliminary treatment effects of a smartphone-based weight loss intervention versus food journals to monitor dietary patterns in minority stroke patients. METHODS: Swipe out Stroke was a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial with open blinded end point. Minority stroke patients and their caregivers were screened for participation using cluster enrollment. We used adaptive randomization for assignment to a behavior intervention with (1) smartphone-based self-monitoring or (2) food journal self-monitoring. The smartphone group used Lose it! to record meals and communicate with us. Reminder messages (first 30 days), weekly summaries plus reminder messages on missed days (days 31-90), and weekly summaries only (days 91-180) were sent via push notifications. The food journal group used paper diaries. Both groups received 4 in-person visits (baseline and 30, 90, and 180 days), culturally competent counseling, and educational materials. The primary outcome was reduced total body weight. RESULTS: We enrolled 36 stroke patients (n=23, 64% African American; n=13, 36% Hispanic), 17 in the smartphone group, and 19 in the food journal group. Mean age was 54 (SD 9) years; mean body mass index was 35.7 (SD 5.7) kg/m2; education, employment status, and family history of stroke or obesity did not differ between the groups. Baseline rates of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score median 5.5, IQR 3.0-9.5), cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score median 23.5, IQR 21-26), and inability to ambulate (5/36, 14% with modified Rankin Scale score 3) were similar. In total, 25 (69%) stroke survivors completed Swipe out Stroke (13/17 in the smartphone group, 12/19 in the food journal group); 1 participant in the smartphone group died. Median weight change at 180 days was 5.7 lb (IQR -2.4 to 8.0) in the smartphone group versus 6.4 lb (IQR -2.2 to 12.5; P=.77) in the food journal group. Depression was significantly lower at 30 days in the smartphone group than in the food journal group (PHQ-9 score 2 vs 8; P=.03). Clinically relevant depression rates remained in the zero to minimal range for the smartphone group compared with mild to moderate range in the food journal group at day 90 (PHQ-9 score 3.5 vs 4.5; P=.39) and day 180 (PHQ-9 score 3 vs 6; P=.12). CONCLUSIONS: In a population of obese minority stroke survivors, the use of a smartphone did not lead to a significant difference in weight change compared with keeping a food journal. The presence of baseline depression (19/36, 53%) was a confounding variable, which improved with app engagement. Future studies that include treatment of poststroke depression may positively influence intervention efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate moderators and mediators of the SB-ED intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of clinical mediators of a digital intervention for women with eating disorders. METHOD: This is an exploratory secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial comparing the SB-ED intervention to referral to usual care among 690 women at 27 United States colleges. Moderators included body mass index (BMI), race, ethnicity, weight/shape concerns, eating disorder impairment, thin ideal internalization, depression, anxiety, and motivation for treatment, assessed at baseline. Thin ideal internalization and depressive symptoms were tested as predictors at postintervention and mediators at 2-year follow-up. Outcome was change in global eating disorder psychopathology. RESULTS: BMI moderated the effect of the intervention at follow-up (but not posttreatment), with individuals with a lower BMI experiencing more continued improvements in eating disorder psychopathology following the intervention than individuals with a higher BMI. Thin ideal internalization mediated the effect of the intervention at follow-up, and depression partially mediated the effect of the intervention at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the mediator analyses suggest that helping college women reduce inflated internalization of the thin ideal and improve depressive symptoms leads to improvements in eating disorder psychopathology. Results also suggest opportunities to optimize the intervention so individuals across the BMI spectrum experience ongoing improvements over time.

Prolonged loneliness in young adulthood is a risk factor for concurrent and future mental health problems and attrition, making college a critical time for support. Cognitive and behavioral interventions show promise for decreasing loneliness and can be widely disseminated through technology. OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the initial efficacy, feasibility, and desirability of a smartphone app, Nod, designed to deliver cognitive and behavioral skill-building exercises to reduce loneliness during the transition to college. METHODS: First-year college students (N=221, mean age 18.7 years, 59% female) were recruited online during incoming student orientation, and randomized to either receive immediate access to Nod (experimental group, n=100) or access after 4 weeks (control group, n=121). The app delivered skills via fully automated (1) ""social challenges,"" suggested activities designed to build social connections; (2) reflections, brief cognitive reframing exercises; and (3) student testimonials that encouraged a growth mindset toward social connection building. Main intention-to-treat analyses were used to compare the conditions on self-assessed loneliness, depressive symptoms, and other mental health and college adjustment outcomes at week 4, controlling for baseline values on those variables. Analyses were also performed to test the hypothesis that the treatment benefits would be particularly pronounced for participants with heightened psychological vulnerability at baseline (ie, higher baseline depressive symptoms and loneliness). RESULTS: Retention was 97% at week 4, and participants viewed an average 36.7 pages of app content. There were no significant condition differences in loneliness at week 4 (F1, 211=0.05, P=.82; ηp2 <.001). However, there was a significant condition-by-baseline depression interaction to predict week-4 loneliness (F1,209=9.65, P=.002; ηp2 =.04). Simple slope analyses indicated that baseline depression positively predicted week-4 loneliness among control participants (r=0.30, t209=3.81, P<.001), but not among experimental participants (r=-0.09, t209=-0.84, P=.40), suggesting that Nod buffered participants with high baseline depression scores from experiencing heightened midquarter loneliness. Similarly, there were no significant condition differences in other week-4 outcomes. However, moderation by baseline vulnerability was found for week-4 depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and indices of college adjustment (eg, perceived social support and campus belonging). CONCLUSIONS: Although Nod exposure did not impact outcomes for the full sample, these results provide initial evidence of its benefit for vulnerable students. The results of this trial suggest that cognitive and behavioral skills delivered via a mobile app can buffer psychologically vulnerable college students against heightened loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as other negative college adjustment outcomes. Future work will aim to improve upon app engagement, and to address loneliness among other key populations.

10.2196/62715,Efficacy of a Mobile App-Based Behavioral Intervention (DRIVEN) to Help Individuals With Unemployment-Related Emotional Distress Return to Work: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Danielson EC, Saturday M, Leonard S, Levit A, Graham AK, Marquez M, Alperin K, Shankman SA, Griffith JW.",JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024.11.26,,,"BACKGROUND: Employment plays an important role in the maintenance of mental and physical health. Losing a job creates emotional distress, which can, in turn, interfere with effective job seeking. Thus, a program for job seekers that provides support for both the logistics of job seeking as well as emotional distress may help people find employment and improve emotional well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the efficacy of the 6-week intervention for job seekers in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: This is a parallel-assignment randomized control trial comparing a 6-week return-to-work intervention versus job seeking as usual for a stratified sample of job seekers (n=150). The intervention will be delivered through a mobile phone app and scheduled video counseling sessions with a job coach. Assessments will be taken weekly during the intervention as well as 8 and 16 weeks later. The intervention and control group procedures will be administered remotely, allowing the study to take place in several regions of the United States. Eligible participants will be adults aged 18 to 65 years, currently unemployed, and actively searching for work. Participants will be recruited from 7 major metropolitan areas in the United States using online advertisements on Craigslist. The primary outcome measure is the Job Search Behavior Scale, which has 2 subscales, preparatory job search behavior and active job search behavior. Employment status will also be assessed throughout the trial. A mixed-model regression analysis will be used to compare job searching behavior in the intervention group versus the control group. A time-to-event analysis (ie, survival analysis) will be used to compare employment status in the 2 experimental groups. Secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including job search self-efficacy and mental health-related outcomes such as anxiety and depression. RESULTS: This study started on August 7, 2023, and as of June 2024, we have enrolled 140 participants. Enrollment began in August 2023 and will conclude by October 2024. Half of the participants (75/150, 50%) will be assigned to the intervention arm while the other half (75/150, 50%) will be assigned to the control arm, job seeking as usual. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study will determine the efficacy of a mobile app-based intervention that uses both job training and psychological techniques on job seeking and employment outcomes. This first trial of Distress Return-to-Work Intervention (DRIVEN) will provide important information about blended support techniques for unemployed individuals, determine the usefulness of mobile apps to address large-scale mental health outcomes, and improve our understanding of the relationship between depression and unemployment status.

10.1186/s13063-022-06623-z,Digital psychosocial intervention for depression among older adults in socioeconomically deprived areas in Brazil (PRODIGITAL-D): protocol for an individually randomised controlled trial,"Nakamura CA, Scazufca M, Moretti FA, Didone TVN, de Sá Martins MM, Pereira LA, de Souza CHQ, de Oliveira GM, da Costa MO, Machado M, da Silva Bitencourt E, Dos Santos MS, Murdoch J, van de Ven P, Seward N, Hollingworth W, Peters TJ, Araya R.",Trials,2022,2022.9.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression in older adults is a challenge for health systems in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Digital strategies for the management of this condition have been emerging worldwide, but the effectiveness of most of them is still unclear, especially among older adults. Thus, we aim to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital psychosocial intervention to treat depression among older adults living in socioeconomically deprived areas in Guarulhos, Brazil. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm individually randomised controlled trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Five hundred older adults aged 60 years or over with depressive symptomatology (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score, PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and registered with one of the primary care clinics will be recruited to participate in this study. A 6-week digital psychosocial programme, named Viva Vida, will be delivered via WhatsApp to participants allocated to the intervention arm. The Viva Vida will send psychoeducational and behavioural activation audio and visual messages 4 days a week for 6 weeks. The control arm will only receive a single message with general information about depression. The primary outcome will be the proportion of depression recovery (PHQ-9 < 10) assessed at 3 months. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at 5 months. A detailed process evaluation will be used to explore context and important implementation outcomes. DISCUSSION: This programme was based on the PROACTIVE intervention and designed to be delivered without face-to-face contact. If effective, it could be a simple treatment option, appropriate not only when social distancing is required, but it could also be included as a regular public health programme to initiate depression treatment, particularly in LMICs where resources allocated to mental health are scarce.

10.1002/wps.20472,The efficacy of smartphone-based mental health interventions for depressive symptoms: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Firth J, Torous J, Nicholas J, Carney R, Pratap A, Rosenbaum S, Sarris J.",World Psychiatry,2017,2017.9.24,,,"The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a population scale. Despite multi-sector investment along with wide-scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta-analysis of smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps than control conditions (g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52, p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g=0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions (g=0.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.33). Effects from smartphone-only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p=0.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self-management tool for depression. Future research should aim to distil which aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which populations."
10.1177/20552076241258400,Feasibility and acceptability of a novel digital therapeutic combining behavioral and pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder,"Monico LB, Eastlick M, Michero D, Pielsticker P, Glasner S.",Digit Health,2024,2024.5.30,,,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the worsening of the opioid epidemic, access to quality treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) including buprenorphine remains a challenge. With the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency, temporary regulatory changes and expanded reimbursement for telehealth services allowed for the rapid expansion of remote treatment for OUD and increased access to buprenorphine, but limited research exists to support this revolutionary shift in care delivery. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of a novel digital therapeutic intervention for OUD combining buprenorphine and behavioral therapy. METHODS: Adults (n = 27) with OUD received treatment with daily sublingual buprenorphine and psychosocial treatment delivered digitally via a smartphone app over 12 weeks. Participants were evaluated monthly for continued opioid use, medication adherence, anxiety and depression indicators, abstinence self-efficacy, craving, and overall well-being, as well as a one-time measure of treatment acceptability. RESULTS: Participants reported increased opioid abstinence days from baseline (M = 8.2, SD = 8.6) to 12 weeks per 30 days (M = 24.9, SD = 10.1), t(20) = -6.5, p < .000, with strong medication adherence across study waves (96.2%). Anxiety and depression indicators, and opioid craving significantly decreased, and abstinence self-efficacy and overall well-being significantly increased following the intervention. Participants also demonstrated high rates of treatment engagement. CONCLUSIONS: As current public health emergency regulatory changes are reviewed for permanency, this feasibility and acceptability study of a novel digital therapeutic intervention for OUD including buprenorphine adds to the growing evidence that supports maintaining telehealth access for quality OUD treatment."

Personalization of target-specific underlying mechanisms might improve treatment effects as well as adherence. Data-driven personalization of treatment, however, is still in its infancy, especially concerning the integration of multiple sources of data-driven advice with shared decision-making. This study describes an innovative type of data-driven personalization in the context of StayFine, a guided app-based relapse prevention intervention for 13- to 21-year-olds in remission of anxiety or depressive disorders (n = 74). Participants receive six modules, of which three are chosen from five optional modules. Optional modules are Enhancing Positive Affect, Behavioral Activation, Exposure, Sleep, and Wellness. All participants receive Psycho-Education, Cognitive Restructuring, and a Relapse Prevention Plan. The personalization approach is based on four sources: (1) prior diagnoses (diagnostic interview), (2) transdiagnostic psychological factors (online self-report questionnaires), (3) individual symptom networks (ecological momentary assessment, based on a two-week diary with six time points per day), and subsequently, (4) patient preference based on shared decision-making with a trained expert by experience. This study details and evaluates this innovative type of personalization approach, comparing the congruency of advised modules between the data-driven sources (1-3) with one another and with the chosen modules during the shared decision-making process (4). The results show that sources of data-driven personalization provide complementary advice rather than a confirmatory one. The indications of the modules Exposure and Behavioral Activation were mostly based on the diagnostic interview, Sleep on the questionnaires, and Enhancing Positive Affect on the network model. Shared decision-making showed a preference for modules improving positive concepts rather than combating negative ones, as an addition to the data-driven advice. Future studies need to test whether treatment outcomes and dropout rates are improved through personalization."

Engaging providers early in the implementation process offers an opportunity to explore their needs and behaviors, integrate interventions into workflows, and better understand provider setting capabilities. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed providers' views on the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app in multiple care settings. METHODS: Participating providers included BH and physical health (PH) providers from a women's health center, an outpatient BH clinic, and both rural/urban primary care settings. All participating providers cocreated workflows through facilitated workshops, including establishing feedback loops between the project team and providers and identifying clinical champions at each site. Over a 12-week period, the providers referred adult patients experiencing anxiety or depression to a mobile app-based dCBI, RxWell, and provided other indicated treatments as part of usual care. Referrals were completed by the providers through the electronic medical record. To better understand facilitators of and challenges in integrating RxWell into routine practice and perceptions of sustainability, a series of qualitative interviews was conducted. Interview data were analyzed to identify major themes using an inductive content analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 19 provider interviews were conducted to discover motivators and barriers for referring RxWell. The providers benefited from a focused discussion on how to incorporate the referral process into their workflow, and knowing the app content was rooted in evidence. Although the providers believed engaging in experiential learning was important, they indicated that more education on the digital health coach role and how to monitor patient progress is needed. The providers thought patient engagement may be impacted by motivation, a lack of comfort using a smartphone, or preference for in-person therapy. The providers also expressed enthusiasm in continuing to refer the app. They liked the ability to provide patients with support between sessions, to have an extra treatment option that teaches BH exercises, and to have a CBT treatment option that overcomes barriers (eg, wait times, copays, travel) to traditional therapy modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Digital intervention success in health care settings relies heavily on engagement of key stakeholders, such as providers, in both design and implementation of the intervention and focused evaluation within intended care setting(s). Scaling digital interventions to meet the mental health needs of patients in usual care settings leans on thoughtfully constructed and streamlined workflows to enable seamless referral of patients by providers. Our findings strongly suggest that providers are supportive of digital tool integration to support the mental health of patients and endorse its use within their routine workflow."

This study introduces Sokoon, a gamified CBT app tailored for Arabic individuals, focusing on alleviating depression and anxiety symptoms (DASDs). OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: Evaluate the effectiveness of Sokoon in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Assess the usability of the intervention through user engagement and adherence to CBT skills. METHODS: A single-group pre-post design evaluated Sokoon's impact on adults with DASDs. In consultation with psychiatrists, Sokoon integrates evidence-based skills such as relaxation, gratitude, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring, represented by planets. Its design incorporates Hexad theory and gamification, supported by a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm. The study involves 30 participants aged 18-35 (86.7% female), specifically those with mild to moderate depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Based on a sample of 30 participants, Sokoon, a smartphone-based intervention, significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety (d = 2.7, d = 3.6, p < 0.001). Over a two-week trial, participants experienced a notable decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating the effectiveness of the model. Sokoon shows potential as a valuable tool for addressing DASDs. CONCLUSION: Sokoon, the gamified CBT application, offers an innovative approach to increasing CBT skills adherence and engagement. By leveraging Hexad theory and gamification, Sokoon provides an enjoyable and engaging user experience while maintaining the effectiveness of traditional CBT techniques. The study findings suggest that Sokoon has a positive impact on reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety."

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of CBT-I delivered via the Sleepcare mobile phone app, compared with a waitlist control group, in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We recruited participants in the Netherlands with relatively mild insomnia disorder. After answering an online pretest questionnaire, they were randomly assigned to the app (n=74) or the waitlist condition (n=77). The app packaged a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. The app was fully automated and adjusted itself to a participant's progress. Program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, after which participants received posttest measurements and a 3-month follow-up. The participants in the waitlist condition received the app after they completed the posttest questionnaire. The measurements consisted of questionnaires and 7-day online diaries. The questionnaires measured insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The diary measured sleep variables such as sleep efficiency. We performed multilevel analyses to study the interaction effects between time and condition. RESULTS: The results showed significant interaction effects (P<.01) favoring the app condition on the primary outcome measures of insomnia severity (d=-0.66) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71). Overall, these improvements were also retained in a 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy of a fully automated mobile phone app in the treatment of relatively mild insomnia. The effects were in the range of what is found for Web-based treatment in general. This supports the applicability of such technical tools in the treatment of insomnia. Future work should examine the generalizability to a more diverse population. Furthermore, the separate components of such an app should be investigated. It remains to be seen how this app can best be integrated into the current health regimens.

Results of the single-arm, chatbot-led Elena+: Care for COVID-19 interventional study","Ollier J, Suryapalli P, Fleisch E, von Wangenheim F, Mair JL, Salamanca-Sanabria A, Kowatsch T.",Front Public Health,2023,2023.9.11,,,"BACKGROUND: The current paper details findings from Elena+: Care for COVID-19, an app developed to tackle the collateral damage of lockdowns and social distancing, by offering pandemic lifestyle coaching across seven health areas: anxiety, loneliness, mental resources, sleep, diet and nutrition, physical activity, and COVID-19 information. METHODS: The Elena+ app functions as a single-arm interventional study, with participants recruited predominantly via social media. We used paired samples T-tests and within subjects ANOVA to examine changes in health outcome assessments and user experience evaluations over time. To investigate the mediating role of behavioral activation (i.e., users setting behavioral intentions and reporting actual behaviors) we use mixed-effect regression models. Free-text entries were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Results show strong demand for publicly available lifestyle coaching during the pandemic, with total downloads (N = 7'135) and 55.8% of downloaders opening the app (n = 3,928) with 9.8% completing at least one subtopic (n = 698). Greatest areas of health vulnerability as assessed with screening measures were physical activity with 62% (n = 1,000) and anxiety with 46.5% (n = 760). The app was effective in the treatment of mental health; with a significant decrease in depression between first (14 days), second (28 days), and third (42 days) assessments: F2,38 = 7.01, p = 0.003, with a large effect size (η2G = 0.14), and anxiety between first and second assessments: t54 = 3.7, p = <0.001 with a medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.499). Those that followed the coaching program increased in net promoter score between the first and second assessment: t36 = 2.08, p = 0.045 with a small to medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.342). Mediation analyses showed that while increasing number of subtopics completed increased behavioral activation (i.e., match between behavioral intentions and self-reported actual behaviors), behavioral activation did not mediate the relationship to improvements in health outcome assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that: (i) there is public demand for chatbot led digital coaching, (ii) such tools can be effective in delivering treatment success, and (iii) they are highly valued by their long-term user base. As the current intervention was developed at rapid speed to meet the emergency pandemic context, the future looks bright for other public health focused chatbot-led digital health interventions."

Providing patients and therapists personalized feedback based on network analysis applied to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data could facilitate case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care. The aim was to explore patients' and therapists' experiences of using an EMA app and personalized feedback based on network theory to aid case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care. METHODS: A n = 5 proof-of-concept study was implemented in routine psycho-oncological care. We purposively selected adult cancer patients suffering from severe CCRF who were on the waitlist for psycho-oncological care. During a 3-week period participants filled out the EMA app Energy InSight (fatigue, mood, activity, responding, and context) five times a day. Participants received a descriptive and network feedback report, which they reflected upon during the first therapy sessions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze user experiences. RESULTS: Patients experienced that filling out the Energy InSight app, as well as receiving descriptive and network-based personalized feedback provided them with insight into their CCRF. Although therapists experienced the discussion of network feedback as challenging, it facilitated the case conceptualization. DISCUSSION: Using EMA during waitlist for psychological care seemed feasible. Patients experienced beneficial effects from filling out the EMA app and talking over the personalized feedback reports, which in turn aided case conceptualization and personalized care. Based on this evaluation, an improved version of the Energy InSight app and a therapist training for providing network feedback is developed for implementation in psycho-oncological care."
10.2196/63143,Optimizing a Novel Smartphone App to Prevent Postpartum Depression Adapted From an Evidence-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program: Qualitative Study,"Lewkowitz AK, Guillen M, Ursino K, Baker R, Lum L, Battle CL, Ware C, Ayala NK, Clark M, Ranney ML, Miller ES, Guthrie KM.",JMIR Hum Factors,2024,2024.12.9,,,"BACKGROUND: Low-income pregnant patients are at high risk of postpartum depression (PPD). Mothers and Babies (MB) is a cognitive behavioral therapy-based program that prevents up to 50% of de novo PPD when provided in person to low-income Spanish- and English-speaking people who are pregnant without depression. MB is limited by the need for trained personnel to support it. Transforming MB into a smartphone app may mitigate this key barrier. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use qualitative data from target end users to create and optimize MBapp, a novel app centered on the MB program. METHODS: Draft wireframes of MBapp were created in English and Spanish with cognitive behavioral therapy-based modules adapted from MB. These wireframes included several features shown previously to sustain app engagement: (1) push notifications delivered at participant-preferred times; (2) text-, graphic-, and video-based content; and (3) gamification with digital rewards for app engagement. English- or Spanish-speaking individuals with public health insurance who were between 32 weeks gestation and 6 months post partum and owned smartphones were eligible to consent for individual in-depth interviews. Individuals with prior or current depression were excluded. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and inductive codes to characterize opinions about MBapp and perceptions of challenges and facilitators of use of MBapp or other perinatal or mental health apps. End user feedback led to major modifications to the wireframes. Each of these changes was categorized according to the FRAME (Framework for Modification and Adaptation), an established method of systematically reporting adaptations and modifications to evidence-based interventions via end user feedback. Recruitment ceased with content saturation, defined as 3 successive participants providing only positive feedback on MBapp's wireframe, without further suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: A total of 25 interviews were completed. Participants were racially and ethnically diverse, generally representing our target end user population, and 48% (n=12) of interviews were conducted in Spanish. Participants' suggestions to improve MBapp were categorized within the FRAME as adaptations that improved either content or context to optimize reach, retention, engagement, and fit for end users. Specifically, the following features were added to MBapp secondary to end user feedback: (1) audio narration; (2) ""ask a clinician"" nonurgent questions; (3) on-demand module summaries accessible upon module completion; and (4) choice to defer assessments and start the next module. Participants also provided insights into features of perinatal or mental health apps they found appealing or unappealing to understand preferences, challenges, and negotiables or nonnegotiables for MBapp. CONCLUSIONS: Adapting MBapp to incorporate end users' perspectives optimized our digital PPD prevention intervention, ideally increasing its appeal to future users. Our team's next steps will confirm that MBapp is a feasible, acceptable intervention among English- and Spanish-speaking perinatal people at risk of PPD."

However, CBT is a complex intervention consisting of several putatively effective components, and how each component may or may not contribute to the overall effectiveness of CBT is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how the users of smartphone CBT use and benefit from various components of the program. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from a 9-week, single-blind, randomized controlled trial that has demonstrated the effectiveness of adjunctive use of smartphone CBT (Kokoro-App) over antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone among patients with drug-resistant major depressive disorder (total n=164, standardized mean difference in depression severity at week 9=0.40, J Med Internet Res). Kokoro-App consists of three cognitive behavioral skills of self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring, with corresponding worksheets to fill in. All activities of the participants learning each session of the program and completing each worksheet were uploaded onto Kokoro-Web, which each patient could use for self-check. We examined what use characteristics differentiated the more successful users of the CBT app from the less successful ones, split at the median of change in depression severity. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients with major depression were allocated to the smartphone CBT. On average, they completed 7.0 (standard deviation [SD] 1.4) out of 8 sessions of the program; it took them 10.8 (SD 4.2) days to complete one session, during which they spent 62 min (SD 96) on the app. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of sessions completed, time spent for the program, or the number of completed self-monitoring worksheets between the beneficiaries and the nonbeneficiaries. However, the former completed more behavioral activation tasks, engaged in different types of activities, and also filled in more cognitive restructuring worksheets than the latter. Activities such as ""test-drive a new car,"" ""go to a coffee shop after lunch,"" or ""call up an old friend"" were found to be particularly rewarding. All cognitive restructuring strategies were found to significantly decrease the distress level, with ""What would be your advice to a friend who has a similar problem?"" found more helpful than some other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The CBT program offered via smartphone and connected to the remote server is not only effective in alleviating depression but also opens a new avenue in gathering information of what and how each participant may utilize the program. The activities and strategies found useful in this analysis will provide valuable information in brush-ups of the program itself and of mobile health (mHealth) in general.

Primary aims of this study were to: 1) examine feasibility and uptake of ¡Aptívate! among depressed Latinx adults with LEP and 2) preliminarily examine ¡Aptívate! efficacy for depression treatment. METHODS: Participants (N = 42) with elevated depressive symptoms were randomized 2:1:1 to: 1) ¡Aptívate! (n = 22), 2) an active control Spanish-language app (""iCouch CBT""; n = 9), or 3) Treatment As Usual (i.e., no app; n = 11). Feasibility was assessed via self-reported app utilization and app analytics data. Depressive symptoms were assessed weekly for eight weeks via self report. RESULTS: All ¡Aptívate! participants used the app at least once, 81.8% of participants used the app ≥8 times, and 36.4% of participants used the app ≥56 times. Weekly retention was strong: 72.7% and 50% of participants continued to use the app at one- and two-months post-enrollment, respectively. Generalized Estimating Equation models indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment, such that ¡Aptívate! participants reported significantly lower depressive symptoms over time than TAU. Depressive symptoms did not differ on average across time between the iCouch and TAU conditions, nor between iCouch and ¡Aptívate!. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include small sample size, limited follow-up, and lack of analytics data for the active control condition. CONCLUSIONS: With further research, ¡Aptívate! may offer a feasible, efficacious approach to extend the reach of evidence-based depression treatment for Latinx adults with LEP."
10.2196/10120,User Experience of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Apps for Depression: An Analysis of App Functionality and User Reviews,"Stawarz K, Preist C, Tallon D, Wiles N, Coyle D.",J Med Internet Res,2018,2018.6.8,,,"BACKGROUND: Hundreds of mental health apps are available to the general public. With increasing pressures on health care systems, they offer a potential way for people to support their mental health and well-being. However, although many are highly rated by users, few are evidence-based. Equally, our understanding of what makes apps engaging and valuable to users is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze functionality and user opinions of mobile apps purporting to support cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and to explore key factors that have an impact on user experience and support engagement. METHODS: We systematically identified apps described as being based on cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. We then conducted 2 studies. In the first, we analyzed the therapeutic functionality of apps. This corroborated existing work on apps' fidelity to cognitive behavioral therapy theory, but we also extended prior work by examining features designed to support user engagement. Engagement features found in cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression were compared with those found in a larger group of apps that support mental well-being in a more general sense. Our second study involved a more detailed examination of user experience, through a thematic analysis of publicly available user reviews of cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression. RESULTS: We identified 31 apps that purport to be based on cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. Functionality analysis (study 1) showed that they offered an eclectic mix of features, including many not based on cognitive behavioral therapy practice. Cognitive behavioral therapy apps used less varied engagement features compared with 253 other mental well-being apps. The analysis of 1287 user reviews of cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression (study 2) showed that apps are used in a wide range of contexts, both replacing and augmenting therapy, and allowing users to play an active role in supporting their mental health and well-being. Users, including health professionals, valued and used apps that incorporated both core cognitive behavioral therapy and non-cognitive behavioral therapy elements, but concerns were also expressed regarding the unsupervised use of apps. Positivity was seen as important to engagement, for example, in the context of automatic thoughts, users expressed a preference to capture not just negative but also positive ones. Privacy, security, and trust were crucial to the user experience. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy apps for depression need to improve with respect to incorporating evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy elements. Equally, a positive user experience is dependent on other design factors, including consideration of varying contexts of use. App designers should be able to clearly identify the therapeutic basis of their apps, but they should also draw on evidence-based strategies to support a positive and engaging user experience. The most effective apps are likely to strike a balance between evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy strategies and evidence-based design strategies, including the possibility of eclectic therapeutic techniques."

Participants: Data was collected from 55 students, who mostly identified as women (82%) and white (84%) and reported at least moderate insomnia symptoms based on the Insomnia Severity Index. Methods: Participants were randomized to either an intervention condition (i.e., 4 wk of CBT-I Coach) or a wait-list condition and completed self-report measures biweekly across the 8-week study period. Results: Nearly 70% of participants found the app moderately to extremely effective. The intervention group experienced a larger reduction in insomnia symptoms from baseline to post-treatment compared to the control group (g = 0.88). Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary evidence that utilizing a self-guided mobile intervention for insomnia among college students is feasible and components of the app were perceived to be moderately to highly effective."

The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-guided, digital CBT-I to improve sleep-specific outcomes. METHOD: An RCT of Australian adults with insomnia and depressive symptoms (N = 1149) compared SHUTi, a digital CBT-I intervention, with HealthWatch, an attention-matched control internet program, at baseline, posttest (9 weeks) and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups. Online sleep diaries were used to derive measures of sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE), number of awakenings, sleep quality, and total sleep time (TST). RESULTS: Participants in the SHUTi condition had greater improvements at posttest compared with control for: SOL, WASO, SE, number of awakenings, and sleep quality. These improvements were sustained at every follow-up (p < .02 for all outcomes except TST, in which statistically significant increases were observed only at 12- and 18-months). CONCLUSIONS: Digitally delivered CBT-I produced lasting improvements in sleep outcomes among adults with insomnia and depressive symptoms. Findings provide further evidence of long-term improvements associated with a digital therapeutic for insomnia, compared to an attention-control condition."
10.2196/33452,Examining the Impact of Digital Components Across Different Phases of Treatment in a Blended Care Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Depression and Anxiety: Pragmatic Retrospective Study,"Wu MS, Wickham RE, Chen SY, Chen C, Lungu A.",JMIR Form Res,2021,2021.12.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety incur significant personal and societal costs. Effective psychotherapies exist, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); however, timely access to quality care is limited by myriad barriers. Blended care therapy models incorporate traditional face-to-face therapy with scalable, digital components of care, expanding the reach of evidence-based care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a blended care CBT program (BC-CBT) in real-world settings and examine the unique impacts of the (1) digital components of care (video lessons and digital exercises) and (2) phase of treatment (early versus late) in decreasing symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 3401 US-based individuals enrolled in a BC-CBT program, who presented with clinical levels of depression and/or anxiety. The treatment program consisted of regular therapy sessions augmented by clinician-assigned digital video lessons and exercises. A growth curve model incorporating time-varying covariates examined the relationship between engagement with BCT components (ie, therapy sessions, digital video lessons, and digital exercises) during the early (weeks 0-7) and late (weeks 8-15) phases of treatment, and weekly symptom reports on depression and anxiety measures. RESULTS: On average, a significant decline in depression and anxiety symptoms was observed during the initial weeks of treatment (P<.001), with a continued, though slower, decline over subsequent weeks (P<.001). Each session completed was associated with significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.72) and depression (b=-0.83) in the early phase, as well as in the late phase (anxiety, b=-0.47; depression, b=-0.27). Significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.15) and depression (b=-0.12) were observed for time spent on video lessons (measured in 10-minute intervals) in the early phase of treatment. Engaging with exercises was associated with statistically significant increases in anxiety symptoms (b=0.03) during the early phase of treatment. However, sensitivity analyses examining the effects of exercises in isolation revealed significant decreases in anxiety (b=-0.05) in the early phase, suggesting a potential suppression effect in the larger model. CONCLUSIONS: Using a retrospective cohort design, therapy sessions and digital video lessons were uniquely predictive of improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms, and their effects were modulated based on the phase of treatment (early vs late). Future research should investigate whether other treatment variables, such as therapeutic alliance or familiarity with technology, are related to differential effects on various components of care."

Self-guided programs on mobile apps are accessible and affordable interventions, with the potential to address subclinical OCD before symptoms escalate. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-guided OCD program on the mobile health (mHealth) app Intellect in improving subclinical OCD and maladaptive perfectionism (MP) as a potential moderator of this predicted relationship. METHODS: University students (N=225) were randomly assigned to an 8-day, self-guided app program on OCD (intervention group) or cooperation (active control). Self-reported measures were obtained at baseline, after the program, and at a 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome measure was OCD symptom severity (Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised [OCI-R]). Baseline MP was assessed as a potential moderator. Depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21) were controlled for during statistical analyses. RESULTS: The final sample included 192 participants. The intervention group reported significantly lower OCI-R scores compared with the active control group after the intervention (partial eta-squared [ηp2]=0.031; P=.02) and at 4-week follow-up (ηp2=0.021; P=.044). A significant, weak positive correlation was found between MP and OCI-R levels at baseline (r=0.28; P<.001). MP was not found to moderate the relationship between condition and OCI-R scores at postintervention (P=.70) and at 4-week follow-up (P=.88). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the self-guided OCD program on the Intellect app is effective in reducing subclinical OCD among university students in Singapore. Future studies should include longer follow-up durations and study MP as a moderator in a broader spectrum of OCD symptom severity.

10.2196/50780,"Race, Ethnicity, and Other Cultural Background Factors in Trials of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: Systematic Review","De Jesús-Romero R, Holder-Dixon AR, Buss JF, Lorenzo-Luaces L.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.2.1,,,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in developing scalable interventions, including internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), to meet the increasing demand for mental health services. Given the growth in diversity worldwide, it is essential that the clinical trials of iCBT for depression include diverse samples or, at least, report information on the race, ethnicity, or other background indicators of their samples. Unfortunately, the field lacks data on how well diversity is currently reported and represented in the iCBT literature. OBJECTIVE: Thus, the main objective of this systematic review was to examine the overall reporting of racial and ethnic identities in published clinical trials of iCBT for depression. We also aimed to review the representation of specific racial and ethnic minoritized groups and the inclusion of alternative background indicators such as migration status or country of residence. METHODS: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials in which iCBT was compared to a waiting list, care-as-usual, active control, or another iCBT. The included papers also had to have a focus on acute treatment (eg, 4 weeks to 6 months) of depression, be delivered via the internet on a website or a smartphone app and use guided or unguided self-help. Studies were initially identified from the METAPSY database (n=59) and then extended to include papers up to 2022, with papers retrieved from Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (n=3). Risk of bias assessment suggested that reported studies had at least some risk of bias due to use of self-report outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 62 iCBT randomized controlled trials representing 17,210 participants are summarized in this study. Out of those 62 papers, only 17 (27%) of the trials reported race, and only 12 (19%) reported ethnicity. Reporting outside of the United States was very poor, with the United States accounting for 15 (88%) out of 17 of studies that reported race and 9 (75%) out of 12 for ethnicity. Out of 3,623 participants whose race was reported in the systematic review, the racial category reported the most was White (n=2716, 74.9%), followed by Asian (n=209, 5.8%) and Black (n=274, 7.6%). Furthermore, only 25 (54%) out of the 46 papers conducted outside of the United States reported other background demographics. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to note that the underreporting observed in this study does not necessarily indicate an underrepresentation in the actual study population. However, these findings highlight the poor reporting of race and ethnicity in iCBT trials for depression found in the literature. This lack of diversity reporting may have significant implications for the scalability of these interventions."

There is growing evidence that depression treatment may improve ART adherence and result in improved HIV outcomes. Given that mental health services are severely underequipped in low-resource settings, including in Uganda, new solutions to increase access to mental health care and close the treatment gap are urgently needed. This protocol paper presents the Suubi-Mhealth study, which proposed to develop a mobile health (mHealth) intervention for use among Ugandan youths (14-17 years) with comorbid HIV and depression, taking into account their unique contextual, cultural, and developmental needs. OBJECTIVE: The proposed study is guided by the following objectives: (1) to develop and iteratively refine an intervention protocol for Suubi-Mhealth based on formative work to understand the needs of youths living with HIV; (2) to explore the feasibility and acceptability of Suubi-Mhealth on a small scale to inform subsequent refinement; (3) to test the preliminary impact of Suubi-Mhealth versus a waitlist control group on youths' outcomes, including depression and treatment adherence; and (4) to examine barriers and facilitators for integrating Suubi-Mhealth into health care settings. METHODS: Youths will be eligible to participate in the study if they are (1) 14-17 years of age, (2) HIV-positive and aware of their status, (3) receiving care and ART from one of the participating clinics, and (4) living within a family. The study will be conducted in 2 phases. In phase 1, we will conduct focus group discussions with youths and health care providers, for feedback on the proposed intervention content and methods, and explore the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. In phase II, we will pilot-test the preliminary impact of the intervention on reducing depression and improving ART adherence. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 1-, 2-, and 6-months post intervention completion. RESULTS: Participant recruitment for phase 1 is completed. Youths and health care providers participated in focus group discussions to share their feedback on the proposed Suubi-Mhealth intervention content, methods, design, and format. Transcription and translation of focus group discussions have been completed. The team is currently developing Suubi-Mhealth content based on participants' feedback. CONCLUSIONS: This study will lay important groundwork for several initiatives at the intersection of digital therapeutics, HIV treatment, and mental health, especially among sub-Saharan African youths, as they transition through adolescence and into adult HIV care settings.

10.2196/51716,Assessing the Short-Term Efficacy of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia With Different Types of Coaching: Randomized Controlled Comparative Trial,"Chan WS, Cheng WY, Lok SHC, Cheah AKM, Lee AKW, Ng ASY, Kowatsch T.",JMIR Ment Health,2024,2024.8.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBTi) is an effective intervention for treating insomnia. The findings regarding its efficacy compared to face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia are inconclusive but suggest that dCBTi might be inferior. The lack of human support and low treatment adherence are believed to be barriers to dCBTi achieving its optimal efficacy. However, there has yet to be a direct comparative trial of dCBTi with different types of coaching support. OBJECTIVE: This study examines whether adding chatbot-based and human coaching would improve the treatment efficacy of, and adherence to, dCBTi. METHODS: Overall, 129 participants (n=98, 76% women; age: mean 34.09, SD 12.05 y) whose scores on the Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] were greater than 9 were recruited. A randomized controlled comparative trial with 5 arms was conducted: dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching and therapist support (dCBTi-therapist), dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching and research assistant support, dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching only, dCBTi without any coaching, and digital sleep hygiene and self-monitoring control. Participants were blinded to the condition assignment and study hypotheses, and the outcomes were self-assessed using questionnaires administered on the web. The outcomes included measures of insomnia (the ISI and the Sleep Condition Indicator), mood disturbances, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, quality of life, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep-related safety behaviors administered at baseline, after treatment, and at 4-week follow-up. Treatment adherence was measured by the completion of video sessions and sleep diaries. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Significant condition-by-time interaction effects showed that dCBTi recipients, regardless of having any coaching, had greater improvements in insomnia measured by the Sleep Condition Indicator (P=.003; d=0.45) but not the ISI (P=.86; d=-0.28), depressive symptoms (P<.001; d=-0.62), anxiety (P=.01; d=-0.40), fatigue (P=.02; d=-0.35), dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (P<.001; d=-0.53), and safety behaviors related to sleep (P=.001; d=-0.50) than those who received digital sleep hygiene and self-monitoring control. The addition of chatbot-based coaching and human support did not improve treatment efficacy. However, adding human support promoted greater reductions in fatigue (P=.03; d=-0.33) and sleep-related safety behaviors (P=.05; d=-0.30) than dCBTi with chatbot-based coaching only at 4-week follow-up. dCBTi-therapist had the highest video and diary completion rates compared to other conditions (video: 16/25, 60% in dCBTi-therapist vs <3/21, <25% in dCBTi without any coaching), indicating greater treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the efficacy of dCBTi in treating insomnia, reducing thoughts and behaviors that perpetuate insomnia, reducing mood disturbances and fatigue, and improving quality of life. Adding chatbot-based coaching and human support did not significantly improve the efficacy of dCBTi after treatment. However, adding human support had incremental benefits on reducing fatigue and behaviors that could perpetuate insomnia, and hence may improve long-term efficacy.

Interventions for depression applied through an app could improve accessibility; yet, to date, adherence to such interventions has been low. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral depression prevention intervention administered through a smartphone app with and without telephone conference calls, (2) analyze the mediators of the change in the incidence of depression and depressive symptoms, and (3) assess adherence and satisfaction with the interventions. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Caregivers with elevated symptoms will be randomly assigned to a cognitive behavioral intervention administered by a smartphone app (CBIA) group, a CBIA plus telephone conference calls (TCCs) group (CBIA + TCC), or an attention control group. Each condition will consist of approximately 58 participants. Both interventions will be administered in five modules through a smartphone app and the CBIA + TCC group will receive additional TCCs in group format (four sessions of 30 min each). Trained blind assessors will conduct pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence of the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral intervention to prevent depression in caregivers with elevated depressive symptoms administered through a smartphone app and the impact of feedback applied through conference calls to increase program adherence and efficacy. If the results were favorable, it would mean that we have developed a more effective, accessible, and clinically useful preventive depression intervention than the currently available ones for many present and future caregivers.

Mobile app-based (mobile health [mHealth]) interventions present a novel approach to both reducing stress and improving well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided mobile app-based psychological intervention for people providing care to family or friends with a physical or mental disability. METHODS: In a randomized, single-blind, controlled trial, 183 caregivers recruited through the web were randomly allocated to either an intervention (n=73) or active control (n=110) condition. The intervention app contained treatment modules combining daily self-monitoring with third-wave (mindfulness-based) cognitive-behavioral therapies, whereas the active control app contained only self-monitoring features. Both programs were completed over a 5-week period. It was hypothesized that intervention app exposure would be associated with decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, and increases in well-being, self-esteem, optimism, primary and secondary control, and social support. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-4 months postintervention. App quality was also assessed. RESULTS: In total, 25% (18/73) of the intervention participants were lost to follow-up at 3 months, and 30.9% (34/110) of the participants from the wait-list control group dropped out before the postintervention survey. The intervention group experienced reductions in stress (b=-2.07; P=.04) and depressive symptoms (b=-1.36; P=.05) from baseline to postintervention. These changes were further enhanced from postintervention to follow-up, with the intervention group continuing to report lower levels of depression (b=-1.82; P=.03) and higher levels of emotional well-being (b=6.13; P<.001), optimism (b=0.78; P=.007), self-esteem (b=-0.84; P=.005), support from family (b=2.15; P=.001), support from significant others (b=2.66; P<.001), and subjective well-being (b=4.82; P<.001). On average, participants completed 2.5 (SD 1.05) out of 5 treatment modules. The overall quality of the app was also rated highly, with a mean score of 3.94 out of a maximum score of 5 (SD 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that mHealth psychological interventions are an effective treatment option for caregivers experiencing high levels of stress. Recommendations for improving mHealth interventions for caregivers include offering flexibility and customization in the treatment design.

10.2196/mental.5283,Supporting Homework Compliance in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Essential Features of Mobile Apps,"Tang W, Kreindler D.",JMIR Ment Health,2017,2017.6.10,,,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychotherapy modalities used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Homework is an integral component of CBT, but homework compliance in CBT remains problematic in real-life practice. The popularization of the mobile phone with app capabilities (smartphone) presents a unique opportunity to enhance CBT homework compliance; however, there are no guidelines for designing mobile phone apps created for this purpose. Existing literature suggests 6 essential features of an optimal mobile app for maximizing CBT homework compliance: (1) therapy congruency, (2) fostering learning, (3) guiding therapy, (4) connection building, (5) emphasis on completion, and (6) population specificity. We expect that a well-designed mobile app incorporating these features should result in improved homework compliance and better outcomes for its users."
10.2196/37302,Adherence and Engagement With a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Conversational Agent (Wysa for Chronic Pain) Among Adults With Chronic Pain: Survival Analysis,"Sinha C, Cheng AL, Kadaba M.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.5.8,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital applications are commonly used to support mental health and well-being. However, successfully retaining and engaging users to complete digital interventions is challenging, and comorbidities such as chronic pain further reduce user engagement. Digital conversational agents (CAs) may improve user engagement by applying engagement principles that have been implemented within in-person care settings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate user retention and engagement with an artificial intelligence-led digital mental health app (Wysa for Chronic Pain) that is customized for individuals managing mental health symptoms and coexisting chronic pain. METHODS: In this ancillary survival analysis of a clinical trial, participants included 51 adults who presented to a tertiary care center for chronic musculoskeletal pain, who endorsed coexisting symptoms of depression or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System score of ≥55 for depression or anxiety), and initiated onboarding to an 8-week subscription of Wysa for Chronic Pain. The study outcomes were user retention, defined as revisiting the app each week and on the last day of engagement, and user engagement, defined by the number of sessions the user completed. RESULTS: Users engaged in a cumulative mean of 33.3 sessions during the 8-week study period. The survival analysis depicted a median user retention period (i.e., time to complete disengagement) of 51 days, with the usage of a morning check-in feature having a significant relationship with a longer retention period (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that user retention and engagement with a CBT-based CA built for users with chronic pain is higher than standard industry metrics. These results have clear implications for addressing issues of suboptimal engagement of digital health interventions and improving access to care for chronic pain. Future work should use these findings to inform the design of evidence-based interventions for individuals with chronic pain and to enhance user retention and engagement of digital health interventions more broadly.

There are insufficient trained professionals to deliver appropriate screening, diagnosis, and treatment. AREAS COVERED: WB001 is a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) based Agent-Guided Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (AGCBT) program for the treatment of PPD, for which Breakthrough Device Designation was recently granted by the US Food and Drug Administration. WB001 combines therapeutic alliance, human-centered design, machine learning techniques, and established principles from CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT). We introduce AGCBT as a new model of service delivery, whilst describing Woebot, the agent technology that enables guidance through the replication of some elements of human relationships. The profile describes the device's design principles, enabling technology, risk handling, and efficacy data in PPD. EXPERT OPINION: WB001 is a dynamic and personalized tool with which patients may establish a therapeutic bond. Woebot is designed to augment (rather than replace) human healthcare providers, unlocking the therapeutic potency associated with guidance, whilst retaining the scalability and agency that characterizes self-help approaches. WB001 has the potential to improve both the quality and the scalability of care through providing support to patients on waiting lists, in between clinical encounters, and enabling automation of measurement-based-care."

Evidence that these two methods represent a risk for depressive relapse/recurrence is however mixed, due to differential or poorly defined concepts. The current study aimed to test the two methods. METHODS: Remitted recurrently depressed patients with low residual depressive symptoms (N = 264) were recruited as part of a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of mobile Cognitive Therapy for recurrent depression versus treatment as usual. In the current secondary analysis, Cox regression models were conducted to test dysfunctional attitudes and extreme responding variables (assessed on the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale [DAS]) as predictors of depressive relapse/recurrence within two years after randomization. RESULTS: Data from 255 participants were analyzed. Results showed that DAS total scores at baseline significantly predicted depressive relapse/recurrence (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.01, p = .042). An index that reflects endorsement of habitual relative to functional responses was a significant predictor of depressive relapse/recurrence (HR = 2.11, p = .029). LIMITATIONS: The current study employed a single measure to identify extreme responses and dysfunctional attitudes. Secondly, various statistical analyses were performed without correcting for multiple testing, which in turn increased the likelihood to finding significant results. CONCLUSIONS: Current study confirmed both methods: People who scored higher on the DAS or had relatively more habitual than functional responses on the extreme positive ends of the DAS had a decreased time to depressive relapse/recurrence."

Economic evaluation of this intervention is needed to help inform local mental health policy and program development. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an economic evaluation conducted alongside 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a psychological intervention delivered through a technological platform (CONEMO) to treat depressive symptoms in people with diabetes, hypertension, or both. METHODS: The economic evaluation uses a within-trial analysis to evaluate the incremental costs and health outcomes of CONEMO plus enhanced usual care in comparison with enhanced usual care from public health care system and societal perspectives. Participants are patients of the public health care services for hypertension, diabetes, or both conditions in São Paulo, Brazil (n=880) and Lima, Peru (n=432). Clinical effectiveness will be measured by reduction in depressive symptoms and gains in health-related quality of life. We will conduct cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, providing estimates of the cost per at least 50% reduction in 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores, and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. The measurement of clinical effectiveness and resource use will take place over baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up in the intervention and control groups. We will use a mixed costing methodology (ie, a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches) considering 4 cost categories: intervention (CONEMO related) costs, health care costs, patient and family costs, and productivity costs. We will collect unit costs from the RCTs and national administrative databases. The multinational economic evaluations will be fully split analyses with a multicountry costing approach. We will calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and present 95% CIs from nonparametric bootstrapping (1000 replicates). We will perform deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, we will present cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to compare a range of possible cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: The economic evaluation project had its project charter in June 2018 and is expected to be completed in September 2021. The final results will be available in the second half of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: We expect to assess whether CONEMO plus enhanced usual care is a cost-effective strategy to improve depressive symptoms in this population compared with enhanced usual care. This study will contribute to the evidence base for health managers and policy makers in allocating additional resources for mental health initiatives. It also will provide a basis for further research on how this emerging technology and enhanced usual care can improve mental health and well-being in low- and middle-income countries.

This pilot study aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a digital training program on developing knowledge and skills in the delivery of a brief behavioral activation intervention for depression among non-specialist providers (NSPs) in Gujarat, India. Participating NSPs, such as community health workers and other frontline providers without specialized training in mental health care, were provided access to a digital program covering the core skills and content necessary to deliver the Healthy Activity Program, an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for depression. NSPs completed knowledge assessments before and after the digital training, followed by focus group discussions to gather their feedback about the program content and delivery format. Of 43 NSPs enrolled in this study, 67% (n = 29) were community health workers called Accredited Social Health Activists and 33% (n = 14) were frontline mid-level health providers called Community Health Officers. Most participants (n = 39; 91%) completed the full course. Knowledge assessment scores showed improvement from pre-training (mean = 29.96; 95% CI: 27.12-32.81) to post-training (mean = 34.62; 95% CI: 31.05-38.19; p = 0.0448). Focus group discussions revealed that participants appreciated the digital mode of training despite facing technical challenges while completing the course. This study further supports the feasibility and acceptability of digital approaches for training frontline providers to deliver brief psychological interventions for depression. With adequate resources and proper execution, digital training holds potential to serve as a key tool to build capacity of NSPs and expand the mental health workforce in India."

It is often dynamic, distinguished by highs and lows, and it is highly responsive to external and internal regulatory processes. Mood dynamics can be defined as a combination of mood variability (the magnitude of the mood changes) and emotional inertia (the speed of mood shifts). The purpose of this study is to explore various distinctive profiles in real-time monitored mood dynamics among MDD patients in routine mental healthcare. METHODS: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data were collected as part of the cross-European E-COMPARED trial, in which approximately half of the patients were randomly assigned to receive the blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (bCBT). In this study a subsample of the bCBT group was included (n = 287). As part of bCBT, patients were prompted to rate their current mood (on a 1-10 scale) using a smartphone-based EMA application. During the first week of treatment, the patients were prompted to rate their mood on three separate occasions during the day. Latent profile analyses were subsequently applied to identify distinct profiles based on average mood, mood variability, and emotional inertia across the monitoring period. RESULTS: Overall, four profiles were identified, which we labeled as: (1) ""very negative and least variable mood"" (n = 14) (2) ""negative and moderate variable mood"" (n = 204), (3) ""positive and moderate variable mood"" (n = 41), and (4) ""negative and highest variable mood"" (n = 28). The degree of emotional inertia was virtually identical across the profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time monitoring conducted in the present study provides some preliminary indications of different patterns of both average mood and mood variability among MDD patients in treatment in mental health settings. Such varying patterns were not found for emotional inertia."

Sufferers of the disease, most of whom are underrepresented minorities, are at increased risk for mental health disorders. The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability and implementation of a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) intervention, Beating the Blues, to improve depression, anxiety, and pain in patients with SCD. Adults with SCD and significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score ≥ 10) or anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7] score ≥ 10) were eligible to participate and be randomized to either receive eight sessions of cCBT with care coach support or treatment as usual. Participants reported daily pain and mood symptoms using a mobile diary app. Depression, anxiety, and pain symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Thirty patients were enrolled: 18 to cCBT, and 12 to control. The cCBT intervention was feasible to implement in clinical settings and acceptable to participants. Patients in the cCBT arm reported a marginally greater decrease in depression at 6 months (-3.82, SE = 1.30) than those in the control group (-0.50, SE = 1.60; p = .06). There were no significant effects of treatment on anxiety; however, cCBT was associated with improved daily pain reported via a mobile diary app (p = .014). cCBT, delivered via mobile device, is a feasible strategy to provide mental health care to adults living with SCD. cCBT was acceptable to the target population; was able to be implemented in real-world, nonideal conditions; and has the potential to improve patient-reported outcomes."

There is emerging evidence that digital interventions, including self-help interventions, may reduce depressive symptoms. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile messaging intervention at reducing subthreshold depressive symptoms among older adults in Brazil. METHODS: PRODIGITAL was a single blind, two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial conducted in 46 primary care clinics in the city of Guarulhos, Brazil. Individuals aged 60+ years were contacted by phone following a randomly ordered list for a screening assessment. Those who presented with anhedonia and/or depressed mood (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2≥1), and who subsequently scored between 5 and 9 on the PHQ-9 were invited to participate. The intervention arm received the 'Viva Vida' digital self-help intervention consisting of automated multi-media messages sent via WhatsApp. Forty-eight audio and visual messages based on psychoeducation and behavioural activation were automatically delivered over six weeks. The control arm received a single message containing information about depression. The primary outcome was the difference in mean PHQ-9 scores between treatment arms at the three-month follow-up. All primary analyses were performed according to allocated arm with imputed data. The trial is registered with ReBEC, RBR-6c7ghfd. FINDINGS: Participants were recruited between 8 September 2021 and 19 August 2022. Of the 454 participants enrolled, 223 were randomised to the intervention arm, 231 to the control arm. Participants' mean age was 65.3 years (SD 5.0) and 64.0% (n = 292) were female. A total of 385 (84.8%) completed the three-month follow-up assessment; no difference in mean PHQ-9 scores between the treatment arms was observed (adjusted difference: -0.61; 95% CI: -1.75, 0.53; p = 0.29). INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that the Viva Vida digital self-help intervention did not help to improve subthreshold depressive symptoms amongst older adults. Further research is needed to understand why this self-help intervention was not effective in this population, and to explore how it might be adapted to achieve this goal.

One protective behavior applicable to post-disaster contexts is behavioral activation (BA). BA is defined here as a behavioral pattern involving presence of valued activity engagement. While relevant post-disaster, the incremental value of BA behaviors in predicting longitudinal post-disaster outcomes is not well understood. We hypothesized that higher baseline engagement in behaviors consistent with a BA framework would predict decreased posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and sleep disturbance approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after hurricane survivors completed baseline measures. METHODS: The current study is a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial of a disaster mental health digital intervention. Participants completed surveys at baseline and approximately 3, 6, and 12 months post-enrollment. Correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were calculated following data screening to predict PTSD symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: Controlling for alcohol use, prior trauma, displacement, and intervention condition, higher baseline BA consistently predicted less PTSD symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and sleep disturbances. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that post-disaster interventions should consider addressing BA. The study provides evidence that BA is potentially an important protective factor longitudinally predicting sleep disturbances and psychopathology after natural disasters."

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that pregnant and postpartum (i.e., perinatal) individuals at risk for depression be referred for therapy or counseling interventions; however, it is unclear to what extent this recommendation has been implemented. METHODS: Pregnant individuals were recruited via advertisements on a pregnancy app and a separate study on sleep. Respondents completed the initial screening questions to determine their risk for perinatal depression, defined as self-reported history of depression; recent stressors; history of emotional, sexual, or physical abuse; mild depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; single; diabetes diagnosis; or unwanted pregnancy. Eligible respondents reported their providers' recommendations for preventing depression, and their utilization of interventions to prevent depression (n = 303). RESULTS: Fewer than 15% of participants reported that a provider referred them for therapy or counseling to prevent depression; recommendations included cognitive behavioral therapy (4%), interpersonal psychotherapy (2.3%), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (4.3%), or other/unknown (6.6%). Approximately 12% reported that a provider recommended medication to prevent depression. Provider referral rates varied by risk factor, but not by patient demographics. Nearly 20% of participants reported using therapy or counseling to prevent depression, and nearly 13% reported using medication to prevent depression. CONCLUSIONS: We explore potential factors affecting the uptake of the USPSTF recommendation and underscore the importance of preventing perinatal depression."

Despite their potential for scalability, few mental wellbeing apps have been rigorously tested in high-powered trials, derived from models of healthy emotional functioning, or tailored to individual profiles. We aimed to test a personalised emotional competence self-help app versus a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help app versus a self-monitoring app to promote mental wellbeing in healthy young people. METHODS: This international, multicentre, parallel, open-label, randomised controlled trial within a cohort multiple randomised trial (including a parallel trial of depression prevention) was done at four university trial sites in four countries (the UK, Germany, Spain, and Belgium). Participants were recruited from schools and universities and via social media from the four respective countries. Eligible participants were aged 16-22 years with well adjusted emotional competence profiles and no current or past diagnosis of major depression. Participants were randomised (1:1:1) to usual practice plus either the emotional competence app, the CBT app or the self-monitoring app, by an independent computerised system, minimised by country, age, and self-reported gender, and followed up for 12 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome was mental wellbeing (indexed by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale [WEMWBS]) at 3-month follow-up, analysed in participants who completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04148508, and is closed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2020, and Aug 3, 2021, 2532 participants were enrolled, and 847 were randomly assigned to the emotional competence app, 841 to the CBT app, and 844 to the self-monitoring app. Mean age was 19·2 years (SD 1·8). Of 2532 participants self-reporting gender, 1896 (74·9%) were female, 613 (24·2%) were male, 16 (0·6%) were neither, and seven (0·3%) were both. 425 participants in the emotional competence app group, 443 in the CT app group, and 447 in the self-monitoring app group completed the follow-up assessment at 3 months. There was no difference in mental wellbeing between the groups at 3 months (global p=0·47). The emotional competence app did not differ from the CBT app (mean difference in WEMWBS -0·21 [95% CI -1·08 to 0·66]) or the self-monitoring app (0·32 [-0·54 to 1·19]) and the CBT app did not differ from the self-monitoring app (0·53 [-0·33 to 1·39]). 14 of 1315 participants were admitted to or treated in hospital (or both) for mental health-related reasons, which were considered unrelated to the interventions (five participants in the emotional competence app group, eight in the CBT app group, and one in the self-monitoring app group). No deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: The emotional competence app and the CBT app provided limited benefit in promoting mental wellbeing in healthy young people. This finding might reflect the low intensity of these interventions and the difficulty improving mental wellbeing via universal digital interventions implemented in low-risk populations.

There is accumulating evidence that universal depression prevention programs may have the capacity to reduce the impact of depression when delivered in the school environment. OBJECTIVE: This trial investigated the effectiveness of SPARX-R, a gamified online cognitive behavior therapy intervention for the prevention of depression relative to an attention-matched control intervention delivered to students prior to facing a significant stressor-final secondary school exams. It was hypothesized that delivering a prevention intervention in advance of a stressor would reduce depressive symptoms relative to the control group. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 10 government schools in Sydney, Australia. Participants were 540 final year secondary students (mean 16.7 [SD 0.51] years), and clusters at the school level were randomly allocated to SPARX-R or the control intervention. Interventions were delivered weekly in 7 modules, each taking approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression as measured by the Major Depression Inventory. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared to controls, participants in the SPARX-R condition (n=242) showed significantly reduced depression symptoms relative to the control (n=298) at post-intervention (Cohen d=0.29) and 6 months post-baseline (d=0.21) but not at 18 months post-baseline (d=0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial to demonstrate a preventive effect on depressive symptoms prior to a significant and universal stressor in adolescents. It demonstrates that an online intervention delivered in advance of a stressful experience can reduce the impact of such an event on the potential development or exacerbation of depression.

We studied the feasibility and acceptability of smartphone application (app)-based PMR for migraine in a neurology setting, explored whether app-based PMR might reduce headache (HA) days, and examined potential predictors of app and/or PMR use. In this single-arm pilot study, adults with ICHD3 migraine, 4+ HA days/month, a smartphone, and no prior behavioral migraine therapy in the past year were asked to complete a daily HA diary and do PMR for 20 min/day for 90 days. Outcomes were: adherence to PMR (no. and duration of audio plays) and frequency of diary use. Predictors in the models were baseline demographics, HA-specific variables, baseline PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) depression and anxiety scores, presence of overlapping pain conditions studied and app satisfaction scores at time of enrollment. Fifty-one patients enrolled (94% female). Mean age was 39 ± 13 years. The majority (63%) had severe migraine disability at baseline (MIDAS). PMR was played 22 ± 21 days on average. Mean/session duration was 11 ± 7 min. About half (47%) of uses were 1+ time/week and 35% of uses were 2+ times/week. There was a decline in use/week. On average, high users (PMR 2+ days/week in the first month) had 4 fewer days of reported HAs in month 2 vs. month 1, whereas low PMR users (PMR < 2 days/week in the first month) had only 2 fewer HA days in month 2. PROMIS depression score was negatively associated with the log odds of using the diary at least once (vs. no activity) in a week (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.55, 0.85]) and of doing the PMR at least once in a week (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.68, 0.91]). PROMIS anxiety was positively associated with using the diary at least once every week (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = [1.09, 1.73]) and with doing the PMR at least once every week (OR = 1.14 [95% CI = [1.02, 1.31]). In conclusion, about half of participants used smartphone-based PMR intervention based upon a brief, initial introduction to the app. App use was associated with reduction in HA days. Higher depression scores were negatively associated with diary and PMR use, whereas higher anxiety scores were positively associated."

Recently, some studies of technology-based interventions for weight reduction emerged to overcome the barriers from time, cost and distance. Mood component and eating behavior related to obesity are less discussed so far with technology-based intervention though. This pilot study was aimed to investigate the effect of telehealth assisted intervention on weight reduction, mood status, and eating behavior change under a smartphone application (app) with novel 3D food picture recognition and incorporated with cognitive behavioral training programs. Adult aged 30-60 years old with overweight were recruited and randomly assigned to control-first group and intervention-first group. In period 1, control-first group had regular life and intervention-first group underwent app intervention; in period 2, two groups went crossover. Body composition and psychological/behavioral questionnaires were collected at baseline, end of period 1, and end of period 2. Nonparametric statistics was performed for data analyzing. A total of 20 participants were enrolled. In control-first group, there were statistically significant reduction in body weight (- 0.55 kg, p = 0.02) and change of body weight percentage (- 0.6%, p = 0.02) after App use. In intervention-first group, the fat percentage decreased by 0.4% after App use in period 1, and increased by 0.05% in period 2. The integrated crossover data revealed that subjects of App group had significant improvements in mindful eating behavior.

However, internet-based interventions for older adults with depression are scarce, and little is known about their feasibility and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To present the design of 2 studies aiming to assess the feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment for older adults with depression. We will assess the feasibility of an online, guided version of the Moodbuster platform among depressed older adults from the general population as well as the feasibility of a blended format (combining integrated face-to-face sessions and internet-based modules) in a specialized mental health care outpatient clinic. METHODS: A single-group, pretest-posttest design will be applied in both settings. The primary outcome of the studies will be feasibility in terms of (1) acceptance and satisfaction (measured with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8), (2) usability (measured with the System Usability Scale), and (3) engagement (measured with the Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale). Secondary outcomes include (1) the severity of depressive symptoms (measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale), (2) participant and therapist experience with the digital technology (measured with qualitative interviews), (3) the working alliance between patients and practitioners (from both perspectives; measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised questionnaire), (4) the technical alliance between patients and the platform (measured with the Working Alliance Inventory for Online Interventions-Short Form questionnaire), and (5) uptake, in terms of attempted and completed modules. A total of 30 older adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15 score between 5 and 11) will be recruited from the general population. A total of 15 older adults with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale 15 score between 8 and 15) will be recruited from a specialized mental health care outpatient clinic. A mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative analyses will be adopted. Both the primary and secondary outcomes will be further explored with individual semistructured interviews and synthesized descriptively. Descriptive statistics (reported as means and SDs) will be used to examine the primary and secondary outcome measures. Within-group depression severity will be analyzed using a 2-tailed, paired-sample t test to investigate differences between time points. The interviews will be recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The studies were funded in October 2019. Recruitment started in September 2022.

The aim was to establish whether a previously validated computerized program (The Sadness Program) remained efficacious when delivered via a mobile application. METHOD: 35 participants were recruited with Major Depression (80% female) and randomly allocated to access the program using a mobile app (on either a mobile phone or iPad) or a computer. Participants completed 6 lessons, weekly homework assignments, and received weekly email contact from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist until completion of lesson 2. After lesson 2 email contact was only provided in response to participant request, or in response to a deterioration in psychological distress scores. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Of the 35 participants recruited, 68.6% completed 6 lessons and 65.7% completed the 3-months follow up. Attrition was handled using mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Both the Mobile and Computer Groups were associated with statistically significantly benefits in the PHQ-9 at post-test. At 3 months follow up, the reduction seen for both groups remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence to indicate that delivering a CBT program using a mobile application, can result in clinically significant improvements in outcomes for patients with depression.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UseIt! mobile health system as both stand-alone and coach-assisted interventions via a randomized controlled trial. The UseIt! System is designed to reduce disruptive behaviors in young children. METHODS: A nationwide sample of parents of children aged 5 years to 8 years with disruptive behaviors (N=324 dyads) are randomly assigned to the stand-alone app (UseIt!; n=108), the coach-assisted app (UseIt! plus supportive accountability; n=108), or the control app (mindfulness app; n=108). The UseIt! App provides parents with tools and troubleshooting to address disruptive behaviors, along with a behavior diary to track behaviors and strategies over time. The coach-assisted condition includes a bachelor's level paraprofessional who provides weekly phone calls to promote engagement with the app. The control condition is composed of a mindfulness app. The web-based, self-assessed outcome measures (post treatment and 6-month follow-up) include measures of app usage, parenting knowledge (eg, knowledge of parent management training and cognitive behavioral therapy skills), and strategies (use of evidence-based parenting strategies), symptom reduction (eg, behavior problems), and parent mental health (eg, anxiety, stress, and depression). We hypothesize that both intervention conditions will show greater parent knowledge and use of skills along with greater symptom reduction relative to the control condition. Further, we hypothesize that those assigned to the coach assisted condition will report greater knowledge, skill use, and symptom reduction than the stand-alone app. We will use intent-to-treat analyses to regress outcomes on study conditions to evaluate for differences across conditions. RESULTS: Recruitment of study participants began in December of 2022 and is ongoing. We have recruited over half of our intended sample of 324 parent-child dyads (n=214) as of December 2024. These dyads have been randomly allocated to each of the intervention conditions, with 71 assigned to the coach-assisted condition, 72 assigned to the stand-alone app, and 71 assigned to the control app condition. Data collection is projected to be completed by late 2026. CONCLUSIONS: The current study aims to address a gap in the literature regarding the feasibility, effectiveness, and utility of a smartphone app that includes a coach-assisted arm. Digital therapeutics have the potential to enhance the reach and scalability of skills-based psychosocial interventions. Findings from this study will advance scientific knowledge and have implications for clinical practice.

10.2196/52369,Feasibility and Acceptability of a Mobile App-Based TEAM-CBT (Testing Empathy Assessment Methods-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) Intervention (Feeling Good) for Depression: Secondary Data Analysis,"Bisconti N, Odier M, Becker M, Bullock K.",JMIR Ment Health,2024,2024.5.10,,,"BACKGROUND: The Feeling Good App is an automated stand-alone digital mobile mental health tool currently undergoing beta testing with the goal of providing evidence-informed self-help lessons and exercises to help individuals reduce depressive symptoms without guidance from a mental health provider. Users work through intensive basic training (IBT) and ongoing training models that provide education regarding cognitive behavioral therapy principles from a smartphone. OBJECTIVE: The key objective of this study was to perform a nonsponsored third-party academic assessment of an industry-generated data set; this data set focused on the safety, feasibility, and accessibility of a commercial automated digital mobile mental health app that was developed to reduce feelings associated with depression. METHODS: The Feeling Good App development team created a waitlist cohort crossover design and measured symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and an app-specific measure of negative feelings called the 7 Dimension Emotion Slider (7-DES). The waitlist cohort crossover design divided the participants into 2 groups, where 48.6% (141/290) of the participants were given immediate access to the apps, while 51.4% (149/290) were placed on a 2-week waitlist before being given access to the app. Data collected by the Feeling Good App development team were deidentified and provided to the authors of this paper for analysis through a nonsponsored university data use agreement. All quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics (version 28.0; IBM Corp). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic variables. Feasibility and acceptability were descriptively assessed. All participants included in the quantitative data were given access to the Feeling Good App; this study did not include a control group. RESULTS: In terms of safety, there was no statistically significant change in suicidality from preintervention to postintervention time points (t288=0.0; P>.99), and there was a statistically significant decrease in hopelessness from preintervention to postintervention time points (F289=30.16; P<.01). In terms of acceptability, 72.2% (166/230) of the users who started the initial 2-day IBT went on to complete it, while 34.8% (80/230) of the users who started IBT completed the entirety of the apps' 4-week protocol (150/230, 65.22% dropout rate over 4 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first reported proof-of-concept evaluation of the Feeling Good App in terms of safety, feasibility, and statistical trends within the data set. It demonstrates a feasible and novel approach to industry and academic collaboration in the process of developing a digital mental health technology translated from an existing evidence-informed treatment. The results support the prototype app as safe for a select nonclinical population. The app had acceptable levels of engagement and dropouts throughout the intervention. Those who stay engaged showed reductions in symptom severity of depression warranting further investigation of the app's efficacy."
10.2196/17755,Mobile App Use for Insomnia Self-Management in Urban Community-Dwelling Older Korean Adults: Retrospective Intervention Study,"Chung K, Kim S, Lee E, Park JY.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020.8.25,,,"BACKGROUND: As an evidence-based psychotherapy for treating insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which helps people with sleep problems to change their unhelpful sleep-related beliefs and habits, has been well-established in older adults. Recently, the utilization of mobile CBT-I apps has been getting attention from mental health professionals and researchers; however, whether mobile CBT-I apps are usable among older users has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore the relationships between subjective sleep quality and subjective memory complaints and depressive symptoms; to explore the relationship between perceived difficulty in mobile app use and usability of the mobile phone-based self-help CBT-I app, named MIND MORE, in urban community-dwelling Korean older adults; to compare changes in subjective sleep quality from pre-intervention to post-intervention, during which they used the mobile app over a 1-week intervention period; and evaluate adherence to the app. METHODS: During the 2-hour training program delivered on 1 day titled ""Overcoming insomnia without medication: How to use the 'MIND MORE' mobile app for systematic self-management of insomnia"" (pre-intervention), 41 attendants were asked to gain hands-on experience with the app facilitated by therapists and volunteer workers. They were then asked to complete questionnaires on sociodemographic characteristics, subjective evaluation of mental health status (ie, depression, memory loss and impairment, and sleep problems), and app usability. For the 1-week home-based self-help CBT-I using the app (post-intervention), 9 of the 41 program attendants, who had already signed up for the pre-intervention, were guided to complete the given questionnaires on subjective evaluation of sleep quality after the 1-week intervention, specifically 8 days after the training program ended. RESULTS: Due to missing data, 40 of 41 attendants were included in the data analysis. The main findings of this study were as follows. First, poor subjective sleep quality was associated with higher ratings of depressive symptoms (40/40; ρ=.60, P<.001) and memory complaints (40/40; ρ=.46, P=.003) at baseline. Second, significant improvements in subjective sleep quality from pre-intervention to post-intervention were observed in the older adults who used the MIND MORE app only for the 1-week intervention period (9/9; t8=3.74, P=.006). Third, apart from the program attendants who did not have a smartphone (2/40) or withdrew from their MIND MORE membership (3/40), those who attended the 1-day sleep education program adhered to the app from at least 2 weeks (13/35, 37%) to 8 weeks (2/35, 6%) without any further contact. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence that the newly developed MIND MORE app not only is usable among older users but also could improve subjective sleep quality after a 1-week self-help intervention period."
10.2196/16136,Adherence to Established Treatment Guidelines Among Unguided Digital Interventions for Depression: Quality Evaluation of 28 Web-Based Programs and Mobile Apps,"Bubolz S, Mayer G, Gronewold N, Hilbel T, Schultz JH.",J Med Internet Res,2020,2020.7.17,,,"BACKGROUND: Web-based interventions for depression have been widely tested for usability and functioning. However, the few studies that have addressed the therapeutic quality of these interventions have mainly focused on general aspects without consideration of specific quality factors related to particular treatment components. Clinicians and scientists are calling for standardized assessment criteria for web-based interventions to enable effective and trustworthy patient care. Therefore, an extensive evaluation of web-based interventions at the level of individual treatment components based on therapeutic guidelines and manuals is needed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of unguided web-based interventions for depression at the level of individual treatment components based on their adherence to current gold-standard treatment guidelines and manuals. METHODS: A comprehensive online search of popular app stores and search engines in January 2018 revealed 11 desktop programs and 17 smartphone apps that met the inclusion criteria. Programs and apps were included if they were available for German users, interactive, unguided, and targeted toward depression. All programs and apps were tested by three independent researchers following a standardized procedure with a predefined symptom trajectory. During the testing, all web-based interventions were rated with a standardized list of criteria based on treatment guidelines and manuals for depression. RESULTS: Overall interrater reliability for all raters was substantial with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.73 and Gwet AC1 value of 0.80. The main features of web-based interventions included mood tracking (24/28, 86%), psychoeducation (21/28, 75%), cognitive restructuring (21/28, 75%), crisis management (20/28, 71%), behavioral activation (19/29, 68%), and relaxation training (18/28, 64%). Overall, therapeutic meaningfulness was rated higher for desktop programs (mean 4.13, SD 1.17) than for smartphone apps (mean 2.92, SD 1.46). CONCLUSIONS: Although many exercises from manuals are included in web-based interventions, the necessary therapeutic depth of the interventions is often not reached, and risk management is frequently lacking. There is a need for further research targeting general principles for the development and evaluation of therapeutically sound web-based interventions for depression."

However, there is high heterogeneity in tDCS efficacy as a stand-alone treatment. To increase its therapeutic potential, researchers have begun to explore the efficacy of combining tDCS with psychological and pharmacological interventions. The current case series details the effect of 6-10 weeks of self-administered tDCS paired with a behavioral therapy smartphone app (Flow™), on depressive and anxiety symptoms, in seven patients (26-51 years old; four female) presenting distinctive psychiatric disorders (major depression, dysthymia, illness anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety disorders). tDCS protocol consisted of an acute phase of daily 30 min sessions, across 10 workdays (2 weeks Monday-to-Friday; Protocol 1) or 15 workdays (3 weeks Monday-to-Friday; Protocol 2). A maintenance phase followed, with twice-weekly sessions for 4 or 3 weeks, corresponding to 18 or 21 sessions in total (Protocol 1 or 2, respectively). The Flow tDCS device uses a 2 mA current intensity, targeting the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The Flow app offers virtually guided behavioral therapy courses to be completed during stimulation. We assessed depressive symptoms using MADRS-S and BDI-II, anxious symptoms using STAI-Trait, acceptability using ACCEPT-tDCS, and side effects using the Adverse Effects Questionnaire, at baseline and week 6 of treatment. Six patients underwent simultaneous cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and two were on antidepressants and benzodiazepines. According to the Reliable Change Index (RCI), for depressive symptoms, we found clinically reliable improvement in five patients using MADRS-S (out of seven; RCI: -1.45, 80% CI; RCI: -2.17 to -4.82, 95% CI; percentage change: 37.9-66.7%) and in four patients using BDI-II (out of five; RCI: -3.61 to -6.70, 95% CI; percentage change: 57.1-100%). For anxiety symptoms, clinically reliable improvement was observed in five patients (out of six; RCI: -1.79, 90% CI; RCI: -2.55 to -8.64, 95% CI; percentage change: 12.3-46.4%). Stimulation was well-tolerated and accepted, with mild tingling sensation and scalp discomfort being the most common side effects. This case series highlights the applicability, acceptability, and promising results when combining home-based tDCS with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy to manage depression and anxiety symptoms in clinical practice."

In this series of studies, we described sociocultural considerations of MHapp development, and we explored participants' perceptions of acceptability, usability, and cultural relevance of the MHapp. Method: Individual interviews were conducted in three separate primary care sites in the Dominican Republic among convenience samples of staff and patients (n = 23, 18, and 21, respectively), using mixed methods of data collection. Results: Modifications were made during the iterative design process to reflect user preferences, which included a female gendered voice, the addition of animations, and changes to the psychoeducational content. Discussion: Primary care patients reported strong interest in MHapps due to its convenience, privacy, and affordability. Our findings support the necessity of detailed examination of user preferences to develop culturally congruent MHapp psychoeducation."

LEP Latinxs have difficulty accessing mental healthcare due to insufficient Spanish-speaking behavioral/mental health clinicians to meet demand. These under-resourced healthcare systems are less likely to be the site for the implementation of innovations. Digital interventions can provide an effective option for overcoming these barriers; yet, when digital evidence-based treatments are available, uptake and engagement is often low. This manuscript presents the protocol for the SUPERA (SUpport from PEeRs to expand Access) study which will evaluate the implementation of an evidence-based, Spanish language, digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (dCBT) intervention (i.e., SilverCloud) in safety-net primary care clinics for LEP Latinx patients with depression or anxiety. METHODS: We will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial (Type 2) design comparing engagement and clinical outcomes in two modalities of dCBT delivery (peer-supported vs. unsupported). We will also compare provider-level outreach (using a clinic patient registry) versus inreach (traditional provider referral) to compare rates of initiation, completion, and cost. Participants will be 426 LEP Latinx adults ≥18 years of age, PHQ-9 ≥ 10 or GAD-7 ≥ 8, with access to the internet via smartphone, and not currently receiving individual psychotherapy. We will collect baseline, post-intervention (8 weeks), and follow up (3 months) data. CONCLUSION: The long-term goal of this research is to aid in the implementation of digital mental health interventions that can be sustainably implemented in low-resourced settings, while reducing the reliance on professionals, overcoming workforce deficits, and increasing relevance for diverse populations."
10.1177/1357633X16659955,Pilot study of psychotherapeutic text messaging for depression,"Pfeiffer PN, Henry J, Ganoczy D, Piette JD.",J Telemed Telecare,2017,2016.7.25,,,"Background Text messaging services could increase access to psychotherapeutic content for individuals with depression by avoiding barriers to in-person psychotherapy such as cost, transportation, and therapist availability. Determining whether text messages reflecting different psychotherapeutic techniques exhibit differences in acceptability or effectiveness may help guide service development. Objectives We aimed to determine: (1) the feasibility of delivering a psychotherapy-based text messaging service to people with depression identified via the internet, (2) whether there is variation in satisfaction with messages according to the type of psychotherapeutic technique they represent, and (3) whether symptoms of depression vary according to receipt of each message type and participants' satisfaction with the messages they received. Methods For this study 190 US adults who screened positive for a major depressive episode (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10) were recruited from online advertisements. Participants received a daily psychotherapy-based text message 6 days per week for 12 weeks. Text messages were developed by a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers to reflect three psychotherapeutic approaches: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), behavioural activation, and cognitive restructuring. Each week the message type for the week was randomly assigned from one of the three types, allowing for repeats. Participants were asked daily to rate each message. On the 7th day of each week, participants completed a two-item depression screener (PHQ-2). Web-based surveys at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks were used as the primary measure of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Results Of the 190 participants enrolled, 85 (45%) completed the 6-week web survey and 67 (35%) completed the 12-week survey. The mean baseline PHQ-9 score was 19.4 (SD 4.2) and there was a statistically significant mean improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -2.9 (SD 6.0; p < 0.001) at 6 weeks and -4.8 (SD 6.6; p < 0.001) at 12 weeks. Mean satisfaction ratings did not vary across message types. There was generally no association between the number of weeks in which participants received a given message type and PHQ-9 scores at follow-up. However, among individuals with more severe depression at baseline (PHQ-9 ≥ 20; n = 30), the number of weeks of behavioural activation messages received was associated with less symptom improvement (ρ = 0.37; p = 0.04) at 12 weeks. Participants who gave higher satisfaction ratings to messages regardless of type had greater reductions in PHQ-9 scores at 6 weeks. Conclusions Study participants exhibited borderline clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks suggesting the effects of the intervention, if any, were small. Although there was no overall variation in changes in PHQ-9 according to users' exposure to the three message types, effectiveness among severely depressed participants could potentially be improved by tailoring towards fewer behavioural activation messages. Controlled studies to determine effectiveness of texting interventions such as this one are indicated considering that even small effects may be cost effective given the low cost of delivering text messages."
10.3174/ajnr.A6632,Changes of Neurotransmitters in Youth with Internet and Smartphone Addiction: A Comparison with Healthy Controls and Changes after Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,"Seo HS, Jeong EK, Choi S, Kwon Y, Park HJ, Kim I.",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,2020,2020.7.4,,,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurotransmitter changes in youth addicted to the Internet and smartphone were compared with normal controls and in subjects after cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, the correlations between neurotransmitters and affective factors were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen young people with Internet and smartphone addiction and 19 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (male/female ratio, 9:10; mean age, 15.47 ± 3.06 years) were included. Twelve teenagers with Internet and smartphone addiction (male/female ratio, 8:4; mean age, 14.99 ± 1.95 years) participated in 9 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy. Meshcher-Garwood point-resolved spectroscopy was used to measure γ-aminobutyric acid and Glx levels in the anterior cingulate cortex. The γ-aminobutyric acid and Glx levels in the addicted group were compared with those in controls and after cognitive behavioral therapy. The γ-aminobutyric acid and Glx levels correlated with clinical scales of Internet and smartphone addiction, impulsiveness, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and sleep quality. RESULTS: Brain parenchymal and gray matter volume-adjusted γ-aminobutyric acid-to-creatine ratios were higher in subjects with Internet and smartphone addiction (P = .028 and .016). After therapy, brain parenchymal- and gray matter volume-adjusted γ-aminobutyric acid-to-creatine ratios were decreased (P = .034 and .026). The Glx level was not statistically significant in subjects with Internet and smartphone addiction compared with controls and posttherapy status. Brain parenchymal- and gray matter volume-adjusted γ-aminobutyric acid-to-creatine ratios correlated with clinical scales of Internet and smartphone addictions, depression, and anxiety. Glx/Cr was negatively correlated with insomnia and sleep quality scales. CONCLUSIONS: The high γ-aminobutyric acid levels and disrupted balance of γ-aminobutyric acid-to-Glx including glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex may contribute to understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of Internet and smartphone addiction and associated comorbidities."
10.1016/j.xagr.2023.100165,Feasibility and impact of a mental health chatbot on postpartum mental health: a randomized controlled trial,"Suharwardy S, Ramachandran M, Leonard SA, Gunaseelan A, Lyell DJ, Darcy A, Robinson A, Judy A.",AJOG Glob Rep,2023,2023.8.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal mood disorders are common yet underdiagnosed and un- or undertreated. Barriers exist to accessing perinatal mental health services, including limited availability, time, and cost. Automated conversational agents (chatbots) can deliver evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy content through text message-based conversations and reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in select populations. Such digital mental health technologies are poised to overcome barriers to mental health care access but need to be evaluated for efficacy, as well as for preliminary feasibility and acceptability among perinatal populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a mental health chatbot for mood management in a general postpartum population. STUDY DESIGN: An unblinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary academic center. English-speaking postpartum women aged 18 years or above with a live birth and access to a smartphone were eligible for enrollment prior to discharge from delivery hospitalization. Baseline surveys were administered to all participants prior to randomization to a mental health chatbot intervention or to usual care only. The intervention group downloaded the mental health chatbot smartphone application with perinatal-specific content, in addition to continuing usual care. Usual care consisted of routine postpartum follow up and mental health care as dictated by the patient's obstetric provider. Surveys were administered during delivery hospitalization (baseline) and at 2-, 4-, and 6-weeks postpartum to assess depression and anxiety symptoms. The primary outcome was a change in depression symptoms at 6-weeks as measured using two depression screening tools: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety symptoms measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and satisfaction and acceptability using validated scales. Based on a prior study, we estimated a sample size of 130 would have sufficient (80%) power to detect a moderate effect size (d=.4) in between group difference on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: A total of 192 women were randomized equally 1:1 to the chatbot or usual care; of these, 152 women completed the 6-week survey (n=68 chatbot, n=84 usual care) and were included in the final analysis. Mean baseline mental health assessment scores were below positive screening thresholds. At 6-weeks, there was a greater decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores among the chatbot group compared to the usual care group (mean decrease=1.32, standard deviation=3.4 vs mean decrease=0.13, standard deviation=3.01, respectively). 6-week mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores did not differ between groups and were similar to baseline. 91% (n=62) of the chatbot users were satisfied or highly satisfied with the chatbot, and 74% (n=50) of the intervention group reported use of the chatbot at least once in 2 weeks prior to the 6-week survey. 80% of study participants reported being comfortable with the use of a mobile smartphone application for mood management. CONCLUSION: Use of a chatbot was acceptable to women in the early postpartum period. The sample did not screen positive for depression at baseline and thus the potential of the chatbot to reduce depressive symptoms in this population was limited. This study was conducted in a general obstetric population. Future studies of longer duration in high-risk postpartum populations who screen positive for depression are needed to further understand the utility and efficacy of such digital therapeutics for that population."
10.2196/12556,"Guided Self-Help Works: Randomized Waitlist Controlled Trial of Pacifica, a Mobile App Integrating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness for Stress, Anxiety, and Depression","Moberg C, Niles A, Beermann D.",J Med Internet Res,2019,2019.6.15,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite substantial improvements in technology and the increased demand for technology-enabled behavioral health tools among consumers, little progress has been made in easing the burden of mental illness. This may be because of the inherent challenges of conducting traditional clinical trials in a rapidly evolving technology landscape. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to validate the effectiveness of Pacifica, a popular commercially available app for the self-management of mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, and depression. METHODS: A total of 500 adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depression were recruited from in-app onboarding to participate in a randomized waitlist controlled trial of Pacifica. We conducted an all-virtual study, recruiting, screening, and randomizing participants through a Web-based participant portal. Study participants used the app for 1 month, with no level of use required, closely mimicking real-world app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were given access to the app after 1 month. Measurements included self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. We performed an intent-to-treat analysis to examine the interactive effects of time and condition. RESULTS: We found significant interactions between time and group. Participants in the active condition demonstrated significantly greater decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in self-efficacy. Although we did not find a relationship between overall engagement with the app and symptom improvement, participants who completed relatively more thought record exercises sustained improvements in their symptoms through the 2-month follow-up to a greater degree than those who completed fewer. In addition, we found that participants who reported concomitantly taking psychiatric medications during the trial benefitted less from the app, as measured by the symptoms of anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that Pacifica, a popular commercially available self-help app, is effective in reducing self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly among individuals who utilize thought records and are not taking psychiatric medication.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Brief Behavioural Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) are effective treatments for patients with persistent pain and depression, respectively. The objectives of this 12 month, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) are (i) to examine the efficacy and cost-utility of adding a group-based form of ACT or BATD to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for patients with CLBP and moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms; (ii) identify pre-post differences in levels of some physiological variables and (iii) analyse the role of polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene, psychological process measures and physiological variables as mediators or moderators of long-term clinical changes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants will be 225 patients with CLBP and moderate to severe depression symptoms recruited at Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu (St. Boi de Llobregat, Spain) and Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain), randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU vs TAU+ACT versus TAU+BATD. A comprehensive assessment to collect clinical variables and costs will be conducted pretreatment, post-treatment and at 12 months follow-up, being pain interference the primary outcome measure. The following physiological variables will be considered at pretreatment and post-treatment assessments in 50% of the sample: immune-inflammatory markers, hair cortisol and cortisone, serum cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin and vitamin D. Polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780, rs9470080 and rs4713916) will be analysed at baseline assessment. Moreover, we will include mobile-technology-based ecological momentary assessment, through the Pain Monitor app, to track ongoing clinical status during ACT and BATD treatments. Linear mixed-effects models using restricted maximum likelihood, and a full economic evaluation applying bootstrapping techniques, acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses will be computed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fundació Sant Joan de Déu and Hospital del Mar. The results will be actively disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, social media and various community engagement activities. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04140838."

Insomnia medications carry additional risk, including increased drowsiness and falls, as well as polypharmacy risks. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), but access is limited. Telehealth is one way to increase access, particularly for older adults, but to date telehealth has been typically limited to simple videoconferencing portals. While these portals have been shown to be non-inferior to in-person treatment, it is plausible that telehealth could be significantly improved. This work describes a protocol designed to evaluate whether a clinician-patient dashboard inclusive of several user-friendly features (e.g., patterns of sleep data from ambulatory devices, guided relaxation resources, and reminders to complete in-home CBTi practice) could improve CBTi outcomes for middle- to older-aged adults (N = 100). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three telehealth interventions delivered through 6-weekly sessions: (1) CBTi augmented with a clinician-patient dashboard, smartphone application, and integrated smart devices; (2) standard CBTi (i.e., active comparator); or (3) sleep hygiene education (i.e., active control). All participants were assessed at screening, pre-study evaluation, baseline, throughout treatment, and at 1-week post-treatment. The primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary and exploratory outcomes span sleep diary, actiwatch and Apple watch assessed sleep parameters (e.g., efficiency, duration, timing, variability), psychosocial correlates (e.g., fatigue, depression, stress), cognitive performance, treatment adherence, and neurodegenerative and systemic inflammatory biomarkers."
10.1186/s12888-017-1193-6,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a guided Internet- and mobile-based intervention for the indicated prevention of major depression in patients with chronic back pain-study protocol of the PROD-BP multicenter pragmatic RCT,"Sander L, Paganini S, Lin J, Schlicker S, Ebert DD, Buntrock C, Baumeister H.",BMC Psychiatry,2017,2017.1.23,,,"BACKGROUND: Reducing the disease burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is of major public health relevance. The prevention of depression is regarded as one possible approach to reach this goal. People with multiple risk factors for MDD such as chronic back pain and subthreshold depressive symptoms may benefit most from preventive measures. The Internet as intervention setting allows for scaling up preventive interventions on a public mental health level. METHODS: This study is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of parallel design aiming to investigate the (cost-) effectiveness of an Internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) for the prevention of depression in chronic back pain patients (PROD-BP) with subthreshold depressive symptoms. eSano BackCare-DP is a guided, chronic back pain-specific depression prevention intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles comprising six weekly plus three optional modules and two booster sessions after completion of the intervention. Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback messages after each module. A total of 406 patients with chronic back pain and without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary patient-relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of MDD measured by the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) at baseline and 1-year post-randomization. Key secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, depression severity, pain intensity, pain-related disability, ability to work, intervention satisfaction and adherence as well as side effects of the intervention. Online assessments take place at baseline and 9 weeks as well as 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Cox regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at 12-month follow-up. Moreover, an economic analysis will be conducted from a societal and public health perspective. DISCUSSION: This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention in a sample of chronic pain patients. If this implementation of a depression prevention IMI into orthopedic aftercare proves effective, the intervention could be integrated into routine care with minimal costs and extended for use with other chronic diseases. Results will have implications for researchers, health care providers and public health policy makers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS): DRKS00007960 . Registered 12 August 2015."
10.2196/17405,A Mobile Health Mindfulness Intervention for Women With Moderate to Moderately Severe Postpartum Depressive Symptoms: Feasibility Study,"Avalos LA, Aghaee S, Kurtovich E, Quesenberry C Jr, Nkemere L, McGinnis MK, Kubo A.",JMIR Ment Health,2020,2020.11.12,,,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD). Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility. RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on ≥50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: -3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: -6.0, P=.005), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: -2.1, P=.02, indicating less sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable. An efficacy trial is warranted."
10.2196/mhealth.8917,A Smartphone App (BlueIce) for Young People Who Self-Harm: Open Phase 1 Pre-Post Trial,"Stallard P, Porter J, Grist R.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2018,2018.2.1,,,"BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen a significant increase in the availability of smartphone apps for mental health problems. Despite their proliferation, few apps have been specifically developed for young people, and almost none have been subject to any form of evaluation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to undertake a preliminary evaluation of a smartphone app (BlueIce), coproduced with young people and designed to help young people manage distress and urges to self-harm. We aimed to assess the acceptability, safety, and use of BlueIce and to explore the effects on the primary outcome of self-harm and the secondary outcomes of psychological functioning. METHODS: We undertook an open trial where we recruited young people aged 12 to 17 years attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) who were currently self-harming or had a history of self-harm. Eligible participants were assessed at baseline and then given BlueIce. They were assessed 2 weeks later (post familiarization) and again at 12 weeks (post use). A behavior-screening questionnaire (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) was completed along with standardized measures of depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire or MFQ) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale or RCADS), taking into account self-reports of self-harm, app helpfulness, and safety. RESULTS: All core CAMHS professional groups referred at least 1 young person. Out of 40 young people recruited, 37 (93%) elected to use BlueIce after familiarization, with 29 out of 33 (88%) wanting to keep it at the end of the study. No young person called the emergency numbers during the 12-week trial, and no one was withdrawn by his or her clinician due to increased risk of suicide. Almost three-quarters (73%) of those who had recently self-harmed reported reductions in self-harm after using BlueIce for 12 weeks. There was a statistically significant mean difference of 4.91 (t31=2.11; P=.04; 95% CI 0.17-9.64) on postuse symptoms of depression (MFQ) and 13.53 on symptoms of anxiety (RCADS) (t30=3.76; P=.001; 95% CI 6.17-20.90), which was evident across all anxiety subscales. Ratings of app acceptability and usefulness were high. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has a number of methodological limitations, particularly the absence of a comparison group and a prospective way of assessing self-harm. Nonetheless, our findings are encouraging and suggest that BlueIce, used alongside a traditional CAMHS face-to-face intervention, can help young people manage their emotional distress and urges to self-harm."
10.1016/j.ajog.2022.09.027,Trial of a patient-directed eHealth program to ameliorate perinatal depression: the MomMoodBooster2 practical effectiveness study,"Danaher BG, Seeley JR, Silver RK, Tyler MS, Kim JJ, La Porte LM, Cleveland E, Smith DR, Milgrom J, Gau JM.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,2023,2022.9.29,,,"Erratum in Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2023 Oct;229(4):482. doi: 10.1016/j.ajog.2023.07.027. BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the most common complications of childbirth, and is experienced by approximately 17% of pregnant women and 13% of postpartum women. An estimated 85% of these women go untreated-an alarming statistic given the serious consequences for the mother, her child, other family members, and society. Professional societies (the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Academy of Pediatrics) have recommended improvements in screening and treatment. Meta-analyses indicate that cognitive behavioral therapy eHealth interventions are efficacious for depression, generally, and for perinatal depression, specifically. Earlier controlled trials have established the effectiveness and acceptability of MomMoodBooster (including an Australian version, MumMoodBooster), an eHealth program for ameliorating postpartum depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a perinatal version of MomMoodBooster encompassing both prenatal and postpartum content in a healthcare delivery setting already providing universal screening and referral of at-risk patients as part of routine care. STUDY DESIGN: A practical effectiveness study randomly assigned 95 pregnant and 96 postpartum women screened as depressed and satisfying eligibility criteria to experimental groups: the healthcare organization's perinatal depression care program (routine-care group) and routine care+MomMoodBooster2 program (eHealth group). Eligibility criteria included: pregnant or <1 year postpartum, ≥18 years of age, no active suicidal ideation, access to broadband internet via desktop/laptop, tablet, or smartphone, and English language proficiency. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses of group effects used fixed-effects growth models to assess 12-week posttest change in outcomes. Results showed that both groups had significantly decreased depression severity, anxiety, stress, and automatic thoughts, and increased behavioral activation and self-efficacy. Relative to the routine-care group, the eHealth group displayed significantly greater decreases in depression severity and stress. These group comparisons were not moderated by depression severity (screening or baseline), anxiety, stress, or pregnant/postpartum status. Almost all (93%; n=89) women in the eHealth group visited their program, of whom 99% visited program sessions (M sessions visited=4.3±2.0; M total session duration=73.0±70.2 minutes; 49% viewed all 6 sessions). Among confirmed eHealth program users who provided ratings, 96% (79/82) rated their program as easy to use, 83% rated it helpful, and 93% (76/82) indicated that they would recommend it. CONCLUSION: Results support the effectiveness of using MomMoodBooster2 as a treatment option for perinatal women with depression, especially when combined with universal depression screening and referral. Consequently, the eHealth program shows promise as a tool to increase the reach of treatment delivery and to potentially reduce the number of untreated perinatal women with depression."
10.2196/mental.5131,Mobile Phone and Web-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depressive Symptoms and Mental Health Comorbidities in People Living With Diabetes: Results of a Feasibility Study,"Clarke J, Proudfoot J, Ma H.",JMIR Ment Health,2016,2016.6.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression is often comorbid with diabetes; however, undertreatment of depressive symptoms in people affected is common. OBJECTIVE: We studied preliminary acceptability and effectiveness of a fully automated, mobile phone, and web-based public health intervention, myCompass, for reducing depressive symptoms and improving mental health comorbidities in people with diabetes. METHODS: In this single-group feasibility study, 89 volunteers with type 1 (n=34) or type 2 (n=55) diabetes and at least mild depressive symptoms used myCompass for 7 weeks. Web-based measures of depressive and anxious symptoms, functional impairment, diabetes-specific variables, and user satisfaction were completed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Retention rates were 54% (n=48) at postintervention and 36% (n=32) at follow-up. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved at postintervention (P<.001; within-group effect size d=1.05), with gains persisting at follow-up. Mental health comorbidities, including anxiety (P<.001), functioning (P<.001), and diabetes-specific distress (P<.001), also showed significant and sustained improvement. Satisfaction with myCompass was high, with convenience and ease of program use, and relevance of program content rated positively by participants. CONCLUSIONS: The myCompass program shows promise as an acceptable and effective treatment for depression and comorbid mental health problems in people with diabetes. The program is broadly available, free to use, and may benefit patients with diabetes who do not access services and/or wish to manage their mental health themselves. Replication of these findings in a controlled study is warranted."
10.1177/2055207617713827,What might get in the way: Barriers to the use of apps for depression,"Stiles-Shields C, Montague E, Lattie EG, Kwasny MJ, Mohr DC.",Digit Health,2017,2018.6.27,,,"OBJECTIVE: Smartphones are being used with increasing frequency to deliver behavioral interventions for depression via apps. However, barriers specific to using an app for depression are poorly defined. The purpose of the current study is to identify barriers to the use of a mobile app to deliver treatment for depression. Secondarily, design implications will be provided based upon identified barriers. METHOD: A card sorting task that ranked and grouped barriers to the use of apps for depression was completed. Participants first completed a card sorting task identifying barriers to face-to-face treatment, as a primer to identification of treatment barriers. The sample consisted of those above (n = 9) and below (n = 11) the threshold for a referral to psychotherapy, to capture anticipated barriers for likely end users. Cluster analyses were conducted to analyze the card sorting data. Multiple analyses were conducted to identify: 1) the most important barriers, and 2) how consistently barriers were ranked as important. RESULT: The card sorting task identified a number of primary barriers to the use of apps for depression treatment, including concerns over intervention efficacy, app functioning, privacy, cost, and lack of guidance and tailored feedback. The top face-to-face treatment barrier was cost, overlapping with mobile barriers. CONCLUSION: This study identified perceived barriers to the use of mobile treatment apps. Identification of barriers implicates design recommendations for apps for depression."
10.2196/46473,"Engagement, Satisfaction, and Mental Health Outcomes Across Different Residential Subgroup Users of a Digital Mental Health Relational Agent: Exploratory Single-Arm Study","Forman-Hoffman VL, Pirner MC, Flom M, Kirvin-Quamme A, Durden E, Kissinger JA, Robinson A.",JMIR Form Res,2023,2023.9.27,,,"BACKGROUND: Mental illness is a pervasive worldwide public health issue. Residentially vulnerable populations, such as those living in rural medically underserved areas (MUAs) or mental health provider shortage areas (MHPSAs), face unique access barriers to mental health care. Despite the growth of digital mental health interventions using relational agent technology, little is known about their use patterns, efficacy, and favorability among residentially vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental health outcomes, and satisfaction across residential subgroups (metropolitan, nonmetropolitan, or rural), MUAs (yes or no), and MHPSAs (yes or no) among users of a smartphone-based, digital mental health intervention, Woebot LIFE (WB-LIFE). WB-LIFE was designed to help users better understand and manage their moods and features a relational agent, Woebot, that converses through text-based messages. METHODS: We used an exploratory study that examined data from 255 adults enrolled in an 8-week, single-arm trial of WB-LIFE. Analyses compared levels of app use and therapeutic alliance total scores as well as subscales (goal, task, and bond), mental health outcomes (depressive and anxiety symptoms, stress, resilience, and burnout), and program satisfaction across residential subgroups. RESULTS: Few study participants resided in nonmetropolitan (25/255, 10%) or rural (3/255, 1%) areas, precluding estimates across this variable. Despite a largely metropolitan sample, nearly 39% (99/255) resided in an MUA and 55% (141/255) in an MHPSA. There were no significant differences in app use or satisfaction by MUA or MHPSA status. There also were no differences in depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, resilience, or burnout, with the exception of MUA participants having higher baseline depressive symptoms among those starting in the moderate range or higher (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item scale≥10) than non-MUA participants (mean 16.50 vs 14.41, respectively; P=.01). Although working alliance scores did not differ by MHPSA status, those who resided in an MUA had higher goal (2-tailed t203.47=2.21; P=.03), and bond (t203.47=1.94; P=.05) scores at day 3 (t192.98=2.15; P=.03), and higher goal scores at week 8 (t186.19=2.28; P=.02) as compared with those not living in an MUA. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the study not recruiting many participants from rural or nonmetropolitan populations, sizable proportions resided in an MUA or an MHPSA. Analyses revealed few differences in app use, therapeutic alliance, mental health outcomes (including baseline levels), or satisfaction across MUA or MHPSA status over the 8-week study. Findings suggest that vulnerable residential populations may benefit from using digital agent-guided cognitive behavioral therapy.

10.2196/54216,Self-Guided Smartphone App (Vimbo) for the Reduction of Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety in South African Adults: Pilot Quantitative Single-Arm Study,"Steyn S, Slabbert M.",JMIR Form Res,2025,2025.1.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Barriers to mental health assessment and intervention have been well documented within South Africa, in both urban and rural settings. Internationally, evidence has emerged for the effectiveness of technology and, specifically, app-based mental health tools and interventions to help overcome some of these barriers. However, research on digital interventions specific to the South African context and mental health is limited. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study investigated the feasibility of using an app (Vimbo) to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression in South African adults recruited from a community sample. The Vimbo app is a self-guided, cognitive behavioral therapy-based digital intervention for common mental health difficulties developed for the South African context. METHODS: This pilot study used a naturalistic, single-arm design testing the Vimbo app over 12 weeks, from October 2020 to February 2021. Participants were recruited through the South African Depression and Anxiety Group and social media advertisements online. A 2-week retention period was used to allow for a minimum of 2 datasets. App usage and engagement metrics were extracted directly from the back end of the app. Based on the model, researchers expected many users to discontinue usage when their symptom levels entered a healthy range. Pre-post review of symptom levels was used to reflect on clinical recovery status at discontinuation after the retention period. RESULTS: A total of 218 applicants met study eligibility criteria and were invited to download the Vimbo app. Of these, 52% (114/218) of the participants registered with the app, who indicated multiple variances of depression and anxiety symptoms ranging in severity from mild to severe. Two participants users withdrew from the study. Moreover, 69% (77/112) of users were retained, including 8 who had technical issues with their treatment. When comparing broad uptake across all interested participants, chi-square analysis indicated significantly reduced uptake in participants identifying as ""unemployed but seeking employment"" (χ24=10.47; N=251; P=.03). When considering app usage for the entire cohort (n=69, excluding participants with technical issues), there was a mean of 72.87 (SD 71.425) total module pages read, a mean of 30% (SD 29.473%) of prescribed content completed, and a mean of 19.93 (SD 27.517) times engaging with tools and skills. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the case for continued exploration of app-based interventions for treating depression and anxiety in South Africa. Developing strategies to increase access and improve intervention uptake may prove essential to helping mobile health interventions make as significant an impact as possible. Future research should include a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample to further assess the efficacy of app-based interventions in treating mental health difficulties in South Africa."
10.2196/54634,Long-Term Efficacy of a Mobile Mental Wellness Program: Prospective Single-Arm Study,"McCallum M, Baldwin M, Thompson P, Blessing K, Frisch M, Ho A, Ainsworth MC, Mitchell ES, Michaelides A, May CN.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024.6.27,,,"BACKGROUND: Rising rates of psychological distress (symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress) among adults in the United States necessitate effective mental wellness interventions. Despite the prevalence of smartphone app-based programs, research on their efficacy is limited, with only 14% showing clinically validated evidence. Our study evaluates Noom Mood, a commercially available smartphone-based app that uses cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programming. In this study, we address gaps in the existing literature by examining postintervention outcomes and the broader impact on mental wellness. OBJECTIVE: Noom Mood is a smartphone-based mental wellness program designed to be used by the general population. This prospective study evaluates the efficacy and postintervention outcomes of Noom Mood. We aim to address the rising psychological distress among adults in the United States. METHODS: A 1-arm study design was used, with participants having access to the Noom Mood program for 16 weeks (N=273). Surveys were conducted at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16, and week 32 (16 weeks' postprogram follow-up). This study assessed a range of mental health outcomes, including anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, well-being, quality of life, coping, emotion regulation, sleep, and workplace productivity (absenteeism or presenteeism). RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 40.5 (SD 11.7) years. Statistically significant improvements in anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress were observed by week 4 and maintained through the 16-week intervention and the 32-week follow-up. The largest changes were observed in the first 4 weeks (29% lower, 25% lower, and 15% lower for anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress, respectively), and only small improvements were observed afterward. Reductions in clinically relevant anxiety (7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale) and depression (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale) criteria were also maintained from program initiation through the 16-week intervention and the 32-week follow-up. Work productivity also showed statistically significant results, with participants gaining 2.57 productive work days from baseline at 16 weeks, and remaining relatively stable (2.23 productive work days gained) at follow-up (32 weeks). Additionally, effects across all coping, sleep disturbance (23% lower at 32 weeks), and emotion dysregulation variables exhibited positive and significant trends at all time points (15% higher, 23% lower, and 25% higher respectively at 32 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes insights into the promising positive impact of Noom Mood on mental health and well-being outcomes, extending beyond the intervention phase. Though more rigorous studies are necessary to understand the mechanism of action at play, this exploratory study addresses critical gaps in the literature, highlighting the potential of smartphone-based mental wellness programs to lessen barriers to mental health support and improve diverse dimensions of well-being. Future research should explore the scalability, feasibility, and long-term adherence of such interventions across diverse populations."
10.2196/10353,"Mobile Apps for Management of Tinnitus: Users' Survey, Quality Assessment, and Content Analysis","Sereda M, Smith S, Newton K, Stockdale D.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019.1.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is the perception of a sound without any outside source. It affects 6 million people in the United Kingdom. Sound therapy is a core component of many tinnitus management programs. Potential mechanisms of benefit include making tinnitus less noticeable, habituation, distracting attention from tinnitus, relaxation, and promoting neuroplastic changes within the brain. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the use of mobile technology. This provided an additional medium through which people with tinnitus can access different tinnitus management options, including sound therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to (1) generate the list of apps that people use for management of their tinnitus, (2) explore reasons for app use and nonuse, (3) perform quality assessment of the most cited apps, and (4) perform content analysis to explore and describe options and management techniques available in the most cited apps. METHODS: A Web-based survey consisting of 33 open and closed questions captured (1) demographic information, information about tinnitus, and hearing loss and (2) mobile app-specific information about the motivation to use an app, the apps which respondents used for tinnitus, important factors when choosing an app, devices used to access apps, and reasons for not using apps. The quality of the most cited apps was assessed using the Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS). Content and features of the most cited apps were analyzed. RESULTS: Data from 643 respondents were analyzed. The majority of respondents (482/643, 75.0%) had never used an app for management of tinnitus mainly because of lack of awareness (381/643, 59.3%). The list of the 55 apps that people use for their tinnitus was generated. These included apps that were developed specifically for the management of tinnitus; however, the majority of cited apps were developed for other problems (eg, sleep, depression or anxiety, and relaxation). Quality assessment of the 18 most popular apps using MARS resulted in a range of mean scores from 1.6 to 4.2 (out of 5). In line with the current model of tinnitus management, sound was the main focus of the majority of the apps. Other components included relaxation exercises, elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, information and education, and hypnosis. CONCLUSIONS: People used apps for the management of their tinnitus; however, this was done mostly as a self-help option, without conjunction with management provided by hearing health care professionals. Further research should consider the place for apps in tinnitus management (stand-alone self-management intervention vs part of the management by a hearing professional). As the content of the apps varies with respect to sound options, information, and management strategies, it seems that the choice of the best management app should be guided by individual patient's needs and preferences."

METHODS: The Korean Diabetes Association has developed a mobile application combining behavioral activation for psychological well-being and diabetes self-management, with conventional medical therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive the application with usual care or only usual care. Primary outcomes measured changes in psychological status and diabetes selfmanagement through questionnaires at week 12 from the baseline. Secondary outcomes assessed glycemic and lipid control, with psychological assessments at week 16. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 73 participants completed the study (20 and 19 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) and were included in the analysis. At week 12, the intervention group showed significant reductions in depression severity and perceived stress compared to the control group. Additionally, they reported increased perceived social support and demonstrated improved diabetes self-care behavior. These positive effects persisted through week 16, with the added benefit of reduced anxiety. While fasting glucose levels in the intervention group tended to improve, no other significant differences were observed in laboratory assessments between the groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence for the potential efficacy of a mobile application that integrates physical and mental health components to address depressive symptoms and enhance diabetes self-management in disadvantaged individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression. Further research involving larger and more diverse populations is warranted to validate these findings and solidify their implications."
10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01592,Preliminary Results From a Randomized Controlled Study for an App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for Depression and Anxiety in Cancer Patients,"Ham K, Chin S, Suh YJ, Rhee M, Yu ES, Lee HJ, Kim JH, Kim SW, Koh SJ, Chung KM.",Front Psychol,2019,2019.8.13,,,"Cancer patients experience various psychological and social difficulties, the most common being depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for depression and anxiety in cancer patients. For this purpose, 63 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday), a simple information-provision mobile-application-based program (HARUCard), or a waitlist control group. Self-report questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Health-Related Quality of Life Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and two computer tasks including the dot-probe task and the Implicit Association Test, were administered before and after 66 days of intervention. The results showed that the Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores of the cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday) group decreased significantly after the intervention compared to the attention control (HARUCard) and waitlist control groups. However, there were no significant changes in scores of the Health-Related Quality of Life Scale and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and the two computer tasks. Such results suggest that a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program may be an effective intervention for alleviating depression and anxiety, but not the general quality of life of cancer patients. Taking into consideration that psychosocial problems may not the topmost priority for cancer patients who are facing a chronic and possibly mortal disease, a mobile-application cognitive behavioral therapy program may be a possible solution for the alleviation of depression and anxiety in cancer patients who have many restraints in terms of time and space."
10.2196/16420,A Mobile Health Intervention System for Women With Coronary Heart Disease: Usability Study,"Sengupta A, Beckie T, Dutta K, Dey A, Chellappan S.",JMIR Form Res,2020,2020.4.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability among American women. The prevalence of CHD is expected to increase by more than 40% by 2035. In 2015, the estimated cost of caring for patients with CHD was US $182 billion in the United States; hospitalizations accounted for more than half of the costs. Compared with men, women with CHD or those who have undergone coronary revascularization have up to 30% more rehospitalizations within 30 days and up to 1 year. Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is the gold standard of care after an acute coronary event, but few women attend these valuable programs. Effective home-based interventions for improving cardiovascular health among women with CHD are vital for addressing this gap in care. OBJECTIVE: The ubiquity of mobile phones has made mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions a viable option to improve healthy behaviors of both women and men with CHD. First, this study aimed to examine the usability of a prototypic mHealth intervention designed specifically for women with CHD (herein referred to as HerBeat). Second, we examined the influence of HerBeat on selected health behaviors (self-efficacy for diet, exercise, and managing chronic illness) and psychological (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) characteristics of the participants. METHODS: Using a single-group, pretest, posttest design, 10 women participated in the 12-week usability study. Participants were provided a smartphone and a smartwatch on which the HerBeat app was installed. Using a web portal dashboard, a health coach monitored participants' ecological momentary assessment data, their behavioral data, and their heart rate and step count. Participants then completed a 12-week follow-up assessment. RESULTS: All 10 women (age: mean 64.4 years, SD 6.3 years) completed the study. The usability and acceptability of HerBeat were good, with a mean system usability score of 83.60 (SD 16.3). The participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements in waist circumference (P=.048), weight (P=.02), and BMI (P=.01). Furthermore, depressive symptoms, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, significantly improved from baseline (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth prototype was feasible and usable for women with CHD. Participants provided data that were useful for further development of HerBeat. The mHealth intervention is expected to help women with CHD self-manage their health behaviors. A randomized controlled trial is needed to further verify the findings."

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia as treatment of choice for insomnia can also be applied digitally (digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia), making it more accessible. This is a secondary data analysis of a two-armed parallel randomized-controlled trial. In the primary publication, N = 238 participants meeting criteria for the 5th edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders chronic insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia + treatment-as-usual, or waitlist + treatment-as-usual. To determine the clinical effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in populations with comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms, this secondary analysis focused on two subgroups: (1) participants with high initial depressive symptoms; and (2) participants with high initial anxiety symptoms. Symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety as primary outcome measures were obtained at baseline, 8 weeks post-randomization and, in the intervention group only, at 6- and 12-months follow-up. At 8 weeks post-randomization, the use of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in both subgroups was associated with large reductions in insomnia severity in comparison to control (depression subgroup: d = 2.37; anxiety subgroup: d = 2.13). Between-group treatment effects were also observed for symptoms of depression in the depression subgroup (d = 1.59), and for symptoms of anxiety in the anxiety subgroup (d = 1.28). Within-group effects were stable over time (d = 0.64-1.63). This secondary analysis shows that digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia reduces insomnia and comorbid symptoms in participants with high initial symptoms of either depression or anxiety with sustained long-term effects."

Since non-pharmacological interventions, such as listening to specific Mozart's compositions, cognitive therapy, psychosocial and educational interventions were shown to reduce epileptic seizures, these modalities can be integrated into mobile software and delivered by mobile medical apps as digital therapeutics. Herein, we describe: (1) a survey study among PWE about preferences to use mobile software for seizure control, (2) a rationale for developing digital therapies for epilepsy, (3) creation of proof-of-concept mobile software intended for use as an adjunct digital therapeutic to reduce seizures, and (4) broader applications of digital therapeutics for the treatment of epilepsy and other chronic disorders. A questionnaire was used to survey PWE with respect to preferred features in a mobile app for seizure control. Results from the survey suggested that over 90% of responders would be interested in using a mobile app to manage their seizures, while 75% were interested in listening to specific music that can reduce seizures. To define digital therapeutic for the treatment of epilepsy, we designed and created a proof-of-concept mobile software providing digital content intended to reduce seizures. The rationale for all components of such digital therapeutic is described. The resulting web-based app delivered a combination of epilepsy self-care, behavioral interventions, medication reminders and the antiseizure music, such as the Mozart's sonata K.448. To improve long-term patient engagement, integration of mobile medical app with music and multimedia streaming via smartphones, tablets and computers is also discussed. This work aims toward development and regulatory clearance of software as medical device (SaMD) for seizure control, yielding the adjunct digital therapeutic for epilepsy, and subsequently a drug-device combination product together with specific antiseizure medications. Mobile medical apps, music, therapeutic video games and their combinations with prescription medications present new opportunities to integrate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for PWE, as well as those living with other chronic disorders, including depression and pain."
10.2196/33449,An Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Prototype Mobile Program for Individuals With a Visible Difference: Mixed Methods Feasibility Study,"Zucchelli F, Donnelly O, Rush E, White P, Gwyther H, Williamson H; VTCT Foundation Research Team at the Centre for Appearance Research.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.1.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Mobile apps may offer a valuable platform for delivering evidence-based psychological interventions for individuals with atypical appearances, or visible differences, who experience psychosocial appearance concerns such as appearance-based social anxiety and body dissatisfaction. Before this study, researchers and stakeholders collaboratively designed an app prototype based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), an evidence-based form of cognitive behavioral therapy that uses strategies such as mindfulness, clarification of personal values, and value-based goal setting. The intervention also included social skills training, an established approach for increasing individuals' confidence in managing social interactions, which evoke appearance-based anxiety for many. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors aim to evaluate the feasibility of an ACT-based app prototype via the primary objectives of user engagement and acceptability and the secondary feasibility objective of clinical safety and preliminary effectiveness. METHODS: To address the feasibility objectives, the authors used a single-group intervention design with mixed methods in a group of 36 participants who have a range of visible differences. The authors collected quantitative data via measures of program use, satisfaction ratings, and changes over 3 time points spanning 12 weeks in outcomes, including selected ACT process measures (experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, and valued action), scales of appearance concerns (appearance-based life disengagement, appearance-fixing behaviors, appearance self-evaluation, and fear of negative appearance evaluation), and clinical well-being (depression and anxiety). Semistructured exit interviews with a subsample of 12 participants provided qualitative data to give a more in-depth understanding of participants' views and experiences of the program. RESULTS: In terms of user engagement, adherence rates over 6 sessions aligned with the upper boundary of those reported across mobile mental health apps, with over one-third of participants completing all sessions over 12 weeks, during which a steady decline in adherence was observed. Time spent on sessions matched design intentions, and engagement frequencies highlighted semiregular mindfulness practice, mixed use of value-based goal setting, and high engagement with social skills training. The findings indicate a good overall level of program acceptability via satisfaction ratings, and qualitative interview findings offer positive feedback as well as valuable directions for revisions. Overall, testing for clinical safety and potential effectiveness showed encouraging changes over time, including favorable changes in appearance-related life disengagement, appearance-fixing behaviors, and selected ACT measures. No iatrogenic effects were indicated for depression or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: An ACT-based mobile program for individuals struggling with visible differences shows promising proof of concept in addressing appearance concerns, although further revisions and development are required before further development and more rigorous evaluation."
10.2196/45409,Cultural Responsivity in Technology-Enabled Services: Integrating Culture Into Technology and Service Components,"Eustis EH, LoPresti J, Aguilera A, Schueller SM.",J Med Internet Res,2023,2023.10.3,,,"Technology-enabled services (TESs) are clinical interventions that combine technological and human components to provide health services. TESs for mental health are efficacious in the treatment of anxiety and depression and are currently being offered as frontline treatments around the world. It is hoped that these interventions will be able to reach diverse populations across a range of identities and ultimately decrease disparities in mental health treatment. However, this hope is largely unrealized. TESs include both technology and human service components, and we argue that cultural responsivity must be considered in each of these components to help address existing treatment disparities. To date, there is limited guidance on how to consider cultural responsivity within these interventions, including specific targets for the development, tailoring, or design of the technologies and services within TESs. In response, we propose a framework that provides specific recommendations for targets based on existing models, both at the technological component level (informed by the Behavioral Intervention Technology Model) and the human support level (informed by the Efficiency Model of Support). We hope that integrating culturally responsive considerations into these existing models will facilitate increased attention to cultural responsivity within TESs to ensure they are ethical and responsive for everyone."

We conducted a large-scale (n = 1013) smartphone-based passive sensing study to identify within- and between-person digital markers of depression and anxiety symptoms over time. Participants (74.6% female; M age = 40.9) downloaded the LifeSense app, which facilitated continuous passive data collection (e.g., GPS, app and device use, communication) across 16 weeks. Hierarchical linear regression models tested the within- and between-person associations of 2-week windows of passively sensed data with depression (PHQ-8) or generalized anxiety (GAD-7). We used a shifting window to understand the time scale at which sensed features relate to mental health symptoms, predicting symptoms 2 weeks in the future (distal prediction), 1 week in the future (medial prediction), and 0 weeks in the future (proximal prediction). Spending more time at home relative to one's average was an early signal of PHQ-8 severity (distal β = 0.219, p = 0.012) and continued to relate to PHQ-8 at medial (β = 0.198, p = 0.022) and proximal (β = 0.183, p = 0.045) windows. In contrast, circadian movement was proximally related to (β = -0.131, p = 0.035) but did not predict (distal β = 0.034, p = 0.577; medial β = -0.089, p = 0.138) PHQ-8. Distinct communication features (i.e., call/text or app-based messaging) related to PHQ-8 and GAD-7. Findings have implications for identifying novel treatment targets, personalizing digital mental health interventions, and enhancing traditional patient-provider interactions. Certain features (e.g., circadian movement) may represent correlates but not true prospective indicators of affective symptoms. Conversely, other features like home duration may be such early signals of intra-individual symptom change, indicating the potential utility of prophylactic intervention (e.g., behavioral activation) in response to person-specific increases in these signals."

Hypotheses predicted the VABA intervention would be more effective than an active control condition in improving mood, decreasing COVID-19 fear/worry and depressive symptoms, and promoting positively reinforcing behaviors during early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were a diverse sample of undergraduate students (N = 296) under a state-wide lockdown. Students were randomized to either VABA, a 10-min values clarification and affirmation task, or Control, a time- and attention-matched task. Positive and negative affects were assessed pre- and post-intervention. At next-day follow-up, positive and negative affects were reassessed, as well as past 24-h behavioral activation and depressive symptoms. Within-group increases in positive affect were observed in both conditions (VABA d = 0.39; Control d = 0.19). However, VABA produced a significantly larger increase than Control (F[2] = 3.856, p = .022, d = 0.22). At 24-h follow-up, behavioral activation, which was significantly higher in VABA versus Control (t[294] = -5.584, p < .001, d = 0.65), predicted fewer depressive symptoms (R2 change = .019, β = -.134, p = .003). VABA is an ultra-brief intervention that appears to have acute effects on mood-enhancement and behavioral activation."

The most effective treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), with evidence suggesting that it is efficacious even when delivered digitally. OBJECTIVE: There are no commercially available digitally delivered CBT-I programs for use by young people. The aim of this project was to develop a smartphone app that delivers CBT-I to young people to improve sleep. METHODS: To inform the development of the app, young people (N=21) aged between 12 and 16 years attended one of the 3 focus groups (each with 4-10 participants). These focus groups were conducted at different stages of the development process such that the process could be iterative. Participants were asked the reasons why they might use an app to help them sleep, the kinds of features or functions that they would like to see in such an app, and any concerns they may have in using the app. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Of the issues discussed by the participants, the researchers selected themes associated with content, functionality, and accessibility and user experience to examine, as these were most informative for the app design process. RESULTS: In terms of content, young people were interested in receiving information about recommended sleep guidelines and personalized information for their age group. They reported that keeping a sleep diary was acceptable, but they should be able to complete it flexibly, in their own time. They reported mixed views about the use of the phone's accelerometer. Young people felt that the functionality of the app should include elements of game playing if they were to remain engaged with the app. Flexibility of use and personalized features were also desirable, and there were mixed views about the schedule of notifications and reminders. Participants reported that for the app to be accessible and usable, it should be from a trusted developer, have engaging aesthetics, have a layout that is easy to navigate, not rely on Internet coverage, and preferably be free. Participants felt that being able to conceal the purpose of the app from peers was an advantage and were willing to provide personal information to use the app if the purpose and use of that information was made clear. Overall, participants endorsed the use of the app for sleep problems among their age group and reported motivation to use it. CONCLUSIONS: The Sleep Ninja is a fully-automated app that delivers CBT-I to young people, incorporating the features and information that young people reported they would expect from this app. A pilot study testing the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the Sleep Ninja is now underway."

This study evaluated the feasibility of a technology-assisted collaborative care (TCC) program for depression in people with diabetes and/or high blood pressure (DM/HBP) attending a primary health care (PHC) facility in Santiago, Chile. Twenty people diagnosed with DM/HBP having a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥ 15 points were recruited. The TCC program consisted of a face-to-face, computer-assisted psychosocial intervention (CPI, five biweekly sessions), telephone monitoring (TM), and a mobile phone application for behavioral activation (CONEMO). Assessments of depressive symptoms and other health-related outcomes were made. Thirteen patients completed the CAPI, 12 received TM, and none tried CONEMO. The TCC program was potentially efficacious in treating depression, with two-thirds of participants achieving response to depression treatment 12 weeks after baseline. Decreases were observed in depressive symptoms and healthcare visits and increases in mental health-related quality of life and adherence to treatment. Patients perceived the CPI as acceptable. The TCC program was partially feasible and potentially efficacious for managing depression in people with DM/HBP. These data are valuable inputs for a future randomized clinical trial."

Mobile app-based behavior change interventions that promote lifestyle physical activity (PA) may serve as viable alternatives or adjuncts to traditional treatments offering increased reach and accessibility. This protocol describes an experimental, pre-post single-arm trial to investigate the feasibility and preliminary effects of an app-based, 9-week PA intervention (MoodMover) designed for individuals with depression. MoodMover is co-designed with patients and a multidisciplinary research team using a no-code intervention development platform (Pathverse). This study will employ a single-arm pre-post trial with an optional 9-week follow-up, following the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model. Thirty-six adults who self-report a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder or report at least mild depressive symptoms based on the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items (PHQ-9) will be recruited. The main outcomes of this study are the feasibility and acceptability of MoodMover, such as the recruitment strategy, assessments (e.g., PHQ-9), and user engagement. Preliminary effects will be assessed by evaluating changes in PA and depressive symptoms. Recruitment is expected to begin on November 1st, 2024, and end on May 1st, 2025. Trial results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals and via presentations at academic conferences. This study fits within Phase IIa: Proof-of-concept and Phase IIb: Pilot and Preliminary Testing of the ORBIT model. The robust feasibility and acceptability measures, especially the user engagement data powered by Pathverse, will provide a comprehensive understanding of the MoodMover intervention's feasibility and potential effects. Results will inform potential progression to the next step of the ORBIT model-Phase IIc: Phase II Efficacy Trial-to test MoodMover in a more rigorous randomized controlled trial.

Research and practitioners have expressed interest in designing and implementing mental health interventions to improve the mental health and well-being of this vulnerable population. However, there is limited effort to systematically synthesize existing evidence on mental health interventions for YPLHIV to address salient questions relating to effectiveness, characteristics, practice issues among others to inform practice, and future research endeavors. This systematic review was conducted to take stock and synthesize existing data to address the above issues. Methods: This review was conducted per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented, utilizing five electronic databases and gray literature repositories. Studies (1) from SSA that focused on young adults with HIV/AIDS and (2) examined the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance mental health outcomes and treatment adherence were included. Two independent reviewers were involved in the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, resolving discrepancies by consensus or consultation. Data were presented using narrative syntheses. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample size of 1510 participants, reporting on interventions from six African countries. The interventions were categorized as follows: cognitive behavioral therapy-based, family-based, peer support, and community-based. The interventions showed mixed effectiveness for depression, with three studies demonstrating significant improvements while four showed no substantial change. The only study on improving anxiety reported promising results. Four interventions positively influenced ART adherence, although with varying magnitudes. Peer support, family-based approach, and digital (mobile phone) approaches were identified as effective strategies. Conclusions: The review showed promising approaches to improve mental health in YPLHIV, namely, through peer support, family-based, and digital (i.e., mobile phone) approaches. Although the results were mixed for depression and limited but positive for anxiety, several interventions improved ART adherence. However, the modest evidence base and varied measurement approaches necessitate more research across SSA."
10.2196/44862,The Effectiveness of a Smartphone Intervention Targeting Suicidal Ideation in Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Influence of Loneliness,"McGillivray L, Keng-Meng Hui N, Wong QJJ, Han J, Qian J, Torok M.",JMIR Ment Health,2023,2023.3.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Loneliness is commonly reported by young people and has been shown to contribute to the rapid onset and escalation of depression and suicidal ideation during adolescence. Lonely people may also be particularly susceptible to disengaging from treatment early given the likelihood of their more complex clinical profiles leading to cognitive fatigue. While a smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy) has been shown to effectively reduce suicidal ideation in young adults, poor engagement is a well-documented issue for this therapeutic modality and has been shown to result in poorer treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether loneliness affects how young people experiencing suicidal ideation engage with and benefit from a therapeutic smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy). METHODS: A total of 455 community-based Australian young adults (aged 18-25 years) experiencing recent suicidal ideation were randomized to use a dialectical behavioral therapy-based smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy) or an attention-matched control app (LifeBuoy-C) for 6 weeks. Participants completed measures of suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and loneliness at baseline (T0), post intervention (T1), and 3 months post intervention (T2). Piecewise linear mixed models were used to examine whether loneliness levels moderated the effect of LifeBuoy and LifeBuoy-C on suicidal ideation and depression across time (T0 to T1; T1 to T2). This statistical method was then used to examine whether app engagement (number of modules completed) influenced the relationship between baseline loneliness and suicidal ideation and depression across time. RESULTS: Loneliness was positively associated with higher levels of overall suicidal ideation (B=0.75, 95% CI 0.08-1.42; P=.03) and depression (B=0.88, 95% CI 0.45-1.32; P<.001), regardless of time point or allocated condition. However, loneliness did not affect suicidal ideation scores across time (time 1: B=1.10, 95% CI -0.25 to 2.46; P=.11; time 2: B=0.43, 95% CI -1.25 to 2.12; P=.61) and depression scores across time (time 1: B=0.00, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.66; P=.99; time 2: B=0.41, 95% CI -0.37 to 1.18; P=.30) in either condition. Similarly, engagement with the LifeBuoy app was not found to moderate the impact of loneliness on suicidal ideation (B=0.00, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.18; P=.98) or depression (B=-0.08, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.03; P=.14). CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was not found to affect young adults' engagement with a smartphone intervention (LifeBuoy) nor any clinical benefits derived from the intervention. LifeBuoy, in its current form, can effectively engage and treat individuals regardless of how lonely they may be.

Insomnia in adolescents attending child mental health services is seldom directly treated, and the effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia (CBTi) on the mental health of adolescents with significant mental health problems are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This open study aimed to assess the feasibility of adding supported Web-based CBT for insomnia to the usual care of young people aged 14 to 17 years attending specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). METHODS: A total of 39 adolescents with insomnia aged 14 to 17 years attending specialist CAMHS were assessed and offered digital CBTi. The digital intervention was Sleepio, an evidence-based, self-directed, fully automated CBTi that has proven effective in multiple randomized controlled trials with adults. Self-report assessments of sleep (Sleep Condition Indicator [SCI], Insomnia Severity Scale, and Web- or app-based sleep diaries), anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale [RCADS]), and depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [MFQ]) were completed at baseline and post intervention. Postuse interviews assessed satisfaction with digital CBTi. RESULTS: Average baseline sleep efficiency was very poor (53%), with participants spending an average of 9.6 hours in bed but only 5.1 hours asleep. All participants scored less than 17 on the SCI, with 92% (36/39) participants scoring 15 or greater on the Insomnia Severity Scale, suggesting clinical insomnia. Of the 39 participants, 36 (92%) scored 27 or greater on the MFQ for major depression and 20 (51%) had clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety. The majority of participants (38/49, 78%) were not having any treatment for their insomnia, with the remaining 25% (12/49) receiving medication. Sleepio was acceptable, with 77% (30/39) of the participants activating their account and 54% (21/39) completing the program. Satisfaction was high, with 84% (16/19) of the participants finding Sleepio helpful, 95% (18/19) indicating that they would recommend it to a friend, and 37% (7/19) expressing a definite preference for a digital intervention. Statistically significant pre-post improvements were found in weekly diaries of sleep efficiency (P=.005) and sleep quality (P=.001) and on measures of sleep (SCI: P=.001 and Insomnia Severity Index: P=.001), low mood (MFQ: P=.03), and anxiety (RCADS: P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has a number of methodological limitations, particularly the small sample size, absence of a comparison group and no follow-up assessment. Nonetheless, our findings are encouraging and suggest that digital CBTi for young people with mental health problems might offer an acceptable and an effective way to improve both sleep and mental health.

We developed an internet-based cognitive behavioral intervention for people with HIV and depressive symptoms, which was based on an effective self-help booklet. The Web-based intervention was previously found to be effective. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate potential mediators of the Web-based intervention. METHODS: This study was part of a randomized controlled trial, in which the intervention was compared with an attention-only waiting list control condition. Participants were 188 (97 in intervention group and 91 in control group) people with HIV and mild to moderate depressive symptoms recruited in HIV treatment centers in the Netherlands. A total of 22 participants (22/188, 11.7%) in the study were female and 166 (166/188, 88.3%) were male. The average age of the participants was 46.30 years (SD 10.63). The intervention comprised Web-based self-help CBT for 8 weeks, 1 to 2 hours a week, including minimal telephone support from a coach. The participants received Web-based questionnaires at pretest, 3 times during the intervention/or waiting period, and post intervention. The outcome was depressive symptoms. Factors tested as potential mediators were changes in behavioral activation, relaxation, the cognitive coping strategies catastrophizing and positive refocusing, goal re-engagement, and coping self-efficacy. RESULTS: Using multilevel structural equation modeling, changes in behavioral activation (P=.006) and goal re-engagement (P=.009) were found to be significant mediators of the intervention effect. The mediation effect seemed to occur between weeks 3 and 5 for behavioral activation and weeks 1 and 3 for goal re-engagement. Using (bivariate) autoregressive latent trajectory analysis, we found a return effect (from the dependent variable to the mediator) for goal re-engagement but not for behavioral activation, which suggested that the mediation effect of changes in behavioral activation was stronger than that in goal re-engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that changes in behavioral activation and goal re-engagement may mediate the effect of the Web-based intervention for people with HIV and depressive symptoms. The results may lead to possible mechanisms of change of the intervention and improvement of therapy outcomes.

The current study aims to examine whether therapists' interpersonal behaviours and patients' active engagement predict treatment outcome and therapist adherence in cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for depressive symptoms. In addition, the study explores rater's explanations for therapist nonadherence at sessions in which therapist adherence was low. Study participants were 61 patients with diabetes and depressive symptoms who were randomized to either CBT or MBCT. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Therapist adherence, therapist interpersonal skills (i.e., empathy, warmth, and involvement), patients' active engagement, and reasons for nonadherence were assessed by two independent raters (based on digital video recordings). Therapist adherence, therapists' interpersonal skills, and patients' active engagement did not predict posttreatment depressive symptom reduction. Patients' active engagement was positively associated with therapist adherence in CBT and in MBCT. This indicates that adherence may be hampered when patients are not actively engaged in treatment. Observed reasons for nonadherence mostly covered responses to patient's in-session behaviour. The variety of reasons for therapist nonadherence might explain why therapist adherence was not associated with outcomes of CBT and MBCT."

Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) might be one possibility to extend the access to evidence-based treatments. Studies suggest that guided iCBT can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in AYA. However, little is known about the effectiveness of iCBT for AYA with chronic somatic conditions and comorbid symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in routine care. Evidence on the (cost-)effectiveness of iCBT is essential for its implementation in health care. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This multicentre two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of guided iCBT (youthCOACHCD) in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU+) in AYA aged 12-21 years with one of three chronic somatic conditions (type 1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis). AYA with one of the chronic somatic conditions and elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7] Screener score ≥ 7) will be eligible for inclusion. We will recruit 212 patients (2 × n = 106) in routine care through three German patient registries. Assessments will take place at baseline and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-randomization. The primary outcome will be combined depression and anxiety symptom severity as measured with the PHQ Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life, coping strategies, self-efficacy, stress-related personal growth, social support, behavioural activation, adjustment and trauma-related symptoms, automatic thoughts, intervention satisfaction, working alliance, and Internet usage. The cost-effectiveness will be determined, and potential moderators and mediators of intervention effects will be explored. DISCUSSION: iCBT might implicate novel ways to increase the access to evidence-based interventions in this specific population. The distinct focus on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of youthCOACHCD in patients with chronic somatic conditions, as well as intervention safety, will most likely provide important new insights in the field of paediatric e-mental health. A particular strength of the present study is its implementation directly into routine collaborative health care. As such, this study will provide important insights for health care policy and stakeholders and indicate how iCBT can be integrated into existing health care systems.

10.1016/j.cct.2021.106569,A SMART approach to optimizing delivery of an mHealth intervention among cancer survivors with posttraumatic stress symptoms,"Smith SK, Somers TJ, Kuhn E, Laber E, Sung AD, Syrjala KL, Feger B, Kelleher SA, Majestic C, Gebert R, LeBlanc M, Owen JE, Applebaum AJ.",Contemp Clin Trials,2021,2021.9.18,,,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many cancer survivors who received intensive treatment such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. PTSD is associated with lower quality of life and other symptoms that require clinical treatment. The iterative treatment decisions that happen in clinical practice are not adequately represented in traditional randomized controlled trials (RCT) of PTSD treatments. The proposed stepped-care SMART design allows for evaluation of initial response to the Cancer Distress Coach mobile app; adaptive stepped-care interventions; and precision treatment strategies that tailor treatment selection to patient characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: HCT survivors (N = 400) reporting PTSD symptoms are being recruited at two cancer centers and randomly assigned to: 1) Cancer Distress Coach app or 2) Usual Care. The app includes educational and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based activities. Four weeks post-randomization, participants re-rate their PTSD symptoms and, based on intervention response, non-responders are re-randomized to receive video-conferenced sessions with a therapist: 3) coaching sessions in using the mobile app; or 4) CBT specific to HCT survivors. Participants complete outcome measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety after Months 1, 3, and 6. Participant characteristics moderating intervention responses will be examined. CONCLUSIONS: This novel adaptive trial design will afford evidence that furthers knowledge about optimizing PTSD interventions for HCT survivors. To our knowledge, this study is the first SMART design evaluating PTSD symptom management in cancer survivors. If successful, it could be used to optimize treatment among a range of cancer and other trauma survivors."

Our hypothesis was that the system would significantly decrease the level of depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared to the control group. METHODS: This pragmatic, randomised controlled trial included 425 patients diagnosed with myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney failure, or lower limb amputation. Participants were recruited from hospitals in Turin and Pisa (Italy), and Lisbon (Portugal), and were randomly assigned to either the NEVERMIND intervention or to the control group. Clinical interviews and structured questionnaires were administered at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms at 12 weeks measured by the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Intention-to-treat analyses included 425 participants, while the per-protocol analyses included 333 participants. This trial is registered in the German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00013391. FINDINGS: Patients were recruited between Dec 4, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019, with 213 assigned to the intervention and 212 to the control group. The sample had a mean age of 59·41 years (SD=10·70), with 44·24% women. Those who used the NEVERMIND system had statistically significant lower depressive symptoms at the 12-week follow-up (mean difference=-3·03, p<0·001; 95% CI -4·45 to -1·62) compared with controls, with a clinically relevant effect size (Cohen's d=0·39). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study show that the NEVERMIND system is superior to standard care in reducing and preventing depressive symptoms among patients with the studied somatic conditions.

Young adults with a major depressive episode in the past year are the least likely to receive treatment for depression compared with other age groups. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized clinical trial following our initial 4-week SMS text message-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-txt) for depression in young adults. We sought to test mechanisms of change for CBT-txt. METHODS: Based on participant feedback, outcome data, and the empirical literature, we increased the treatment dosage from 4-8 weeks and tested 3 mechanisms of change with 103 young adults in the United States. Participants were from 34 states, recruited from Facebook and Instagram and presenting with at least moderate depressive symptomatology. Web-based assessments occurred at baseline prior to randomization and at 1, 2, and 3 months after enrollment. The primary outcome, the severity of depressive symptoms, was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II. Behavioral activation, perseverative thinking, and cognitive distortions were measured as mechanisms of change. Participants were randomized to CBT-txt or a waitlist control condition. Those assigned to the CBT-txt intervention condition received 474 fully automated SMS text messages, delivered every other day over a 64-day period and averaging 14.8 (SD 2.4) SMS text messages per treatment day. Intervention texts are delivered via TextIt, a web-based automated SMS text messaging platform. RESULTS: Across all 3 months of the study, participants in the CBT-txt group showed significantly larger decreases in depressive symptoms than those in the control group (P<.001 at each follow-up), producing a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen d=0.76). Over half (25/47, 53%) of the treatment group moved into the ""high-end functioning"" category, representing no or minimal clinically significant depressive symptoms, compared with 15% (8/53) of the control condition. Mediation analysis showed that CBT-txt appeared to lead to greater increases in behavioral activation and greater decreases in cognitive distortions and perseverative thinking across the 3-month follow-up period, which were then associated with larger baseline to 3-month decreases in depression. The size of the indirect effects was substantial: 57%, 41%, and 50% of the CBT-txt effect on changes in depression were mediated by changes in behavioral activation, cognitive distortions, and perseverative thinking, respectively. Models including all 3 mediators simultaneously showed that 63% of the CBT-txt effect was mediated by the combined indirect effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the efficacy of CBT-txt to reduce young adult depressive symptoms through hypothesized mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, CBT-txt is unique in its SMS text message-delivered modality, the strong clinical evidence supporting efficacy and mechanisms of change.

One such intervention, SPARX, is a gamified mobile computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) developed for adolescents in New Zealand, which was shown to be as effective as usual care for young people with mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression. However, gamified cCBT has not yet been tested in Japan. OBJECTIVE: This trial is designed to investigate whether a Japanese-adapted version of SPARX improves depressive symptoms in Japanese university students with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms. METHODS: In this 7-week, multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, superiority randomized trial, participants will be allocated to either a treatment condition (SPARX) or a wait-list control condition. SPARX is a fully automated program, which will be delivered to the mobile phone or tablet device of the participants. SPARX is designed as an interactive fantasy game to guide the user through seven modules that teach key CBT strategies. All participants will be recruited from universities via advertisements on online bulletin boards, the campus newspaper, and posters. Participants in the treatment condition will use the SPARX program weekly. The primary outcome is the reduction of depressive symptoms (using Patient Health Questionnaires-9) measured at baseline and weekly: once after the 7-week intervention and once at a 1-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include satisfaction with the program and satisfaction with life, measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale; positive and negative moods, measured by the Profile of Mood States Second Edition; social functioning, measured by the EuroQol Instrument; rumination, measured by the Ruminative Responses Scale; and coping, measured by the Brief Coping Orientation to Problem Experienced Inventory. RESULTS: This study received funding from The Research Institute of Personalized Health Sciences, Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, and obtained institutional review board approval in September 2019. Data collection began in April 2019.

Among these, costs due to psychiatric hospitalization are a major burden. Smartphones comprise an innovative and unique platform for the monitoring and treatment of depression and mania. No prior trial has investigated whether the use of a smartphone-based system can prevent re-admission among patients discharged from hospital. The present RADMIS trials aim to investigate whether using a smartphone-based monitoring and treatment system, including an integrated clinical feedback loop, reduces the rate and duration of re-admissions more than standard treatment in unipolar disorder and bipolar disorder. METHODS: The RADMIS trials use a randomized controlled, single-blind, parallel-group design. Patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar disorder are invited to participate in each trial when discharged from psychiatric hospitals in The Capital Region of Denmark following an affective episode and randomized to either (1) a smartphone-based monitoring system including (a) an integrated feedback loop between patients and clinicians and (b) context-aware cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules (intervention group) or (2) standard treatment (control group) for a 6-month trial period. The trial started in May 2017. The outcomes are (1) number and duration of re-admissions (primary), (2) severity of depressive and manic (only for patients with bipolar disorder) symptoms; psychosocial functioning; number of affective episodes (secondary), and (3) perceived stress, quality of life, self-rated depressive symptoms, self-rated manic symptoms (only for patients with bipolar disorder), recovery, empowerment, adherence to medication, wellbeing, ruminations, worrying, and satisfaction (tertiary). A total of 400 patients (200 patients with unipolar disorder and 200 patients with bipolar disorder) will be included in the RADMIS trials. DISCUSSION: If the smartphone-based monitoring system proves effective in reducing the rate and duration of re-admissions, there will be basis for using a system of this kind in the treatment of unipolar and bipolar disorder in general and on a larger scale.

For example, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a highly-promoted approach to identifying and treating individuals at risk for alcohol or drug problems, yet effective, routine use of SBIRT has lagged. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the development, pilot testing, and trial protocol of a mobile app based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to promote SBIRT skill translation and application. METHODS: Intended for use after classroom training occurs, the mobile app has three primary functions designed to increase behavioral intent to deliver SBIRT: (1) review skills (ie, address knowledge and beliefs about SBIRT), (2) apply skills with patients (ie, build confidence and perceived behavioral control), and (3) report performance data (ie, increase accountability and social norms and/or influence). The app includes depression and anxiety screening tools due to high comorbidity with substance use. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is in progress among health and social service learners (N=200) recruited from 3 universities and 6 different training programs in nursing, social work, internal medicine, psychiatry, and psychology. Participants are randomized to SBIRT classroom instruction alone or classroom instruction plus app access prior to beginning their field placement rotations. TPB-based data are collected via Qualtrics or via the mobile app pre-post and SBIRT utilization, weekly for 10 weeks. Key outcomes include the frequency of and self-reported confidence in delivery of SBIRT. RESULTS: Beta testing with advanced practice nursing students (N=22) indicated that the app and its associated assessment tools were acceptable and useful. The system usability scale (SUS) mean was 65.8 (n=19), which indicated that the SBIRT app was acceptable but could benefit from improvement. Indeed, modifications were implemented prior to starting the trial. Enrollment of trial participants began in September 2016. Results are expected by December 2017. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the process of TPB-based app development and testing, and the protocol for a RCT to determine the effectiveness of the app in enhancing skill translation. If effective, this approach could improve SBIRT implementation, fidelity, and clinical outcomes."
10.1037/ort0000517,The effects of brief behavioral activation (BA) on children with physical disabilities: A randomized controlled trial,"Suh JW, Lee EB, Han Y, Lee MG, Choi KH.",Am J Orthopsychiatry,2021,2020.10.13,,,"The majority of children with physical disabilities experience significant restrictions in their daily lives. Notably, they are at a risk for lower levels of activity and involvement in critical life domains. To address this issue, this study investigated whether behavioral activation (BA), in tandem with the installment of power-assisted devices (PAD), would have beneficial effects on activity levels, overall involvement in life domains, mobility, and depressive symptoms among children with physical disabilities. From among 123 children with physical disabilities aged 6-13 who used a nonpowered wheelchair device, 40 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized into either the PAD-only group or the BA + PAD group. The participants were assessed at 3 time periods (pretreatment, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks), using standardized self-report measures and digital odometers. Both groups showed an increase in the distance traveled. Although BA + PAD had no additional benefits over PAD-only in improving the distance traveled and depressive symptoms, the BA + PAD group showed significantly higher levels of activity and overall involvement in life domains than the PAD-only group did. The findings provide preliminary support for the provision of BA for children with physical disabilities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, not all evidence-based treatments are easily accessible. Web-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (wCBT) facilitated by laypersons is a viable treatment alternative. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel wCBT program, Empower@Home, supported by trained lay coaches, against a waitlist attention control. Empower@Home is among the very few existing wCBT programs specifically designed for older adults. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of the intervention compared with attention control. The secondary objective was to evaluate the program's impact on secondary psychosocial outcomes and explore potential change mechanisms. METHODS: Older adults (N=70) were recruited via web-based research registries, social media advertisements, and community agency referrals and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention group received access to Empower@Home, which included 9 web-delivered self-help lessons and weekly telephone coaching sessions by a trained layperson over 10 weeks. The control group received weekly friendly phone calls and depressive symptom monitoring. The primary clinical outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The secondary clinical outcomes included anxiety, anger, social isolation, insomnia, pain intensity, and quality of life. Linear mixed modeling was used to determine the treatment effects on depression, and 2-tailed t tests were used to assess within-group changes and between-group differences. RESULTS: Most participants in the intervention group completed all 9 sessions (31/35, 89%). The usability and acceptability ratings were excellent. The intervention group had a large within-group change in depressive symptoms (Cohen d=1.22; P<.001), whereas the attention control group experienced a medium change (Cohen d=0.57; P<.001). The between-group effect size was significant, favoring the intervention group over the control group (Cohen d=0.72; P<.001). In the linear mixed model, the group-by-time interaction was statistically significant (b=-0.68, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.35; P<.001). The treatment effects were mediated by improvements in cognitive behavioral therapy skills acquisition; behavioral activation; and satisfaction with the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Furthermore, the intervention group showed significant within-group improvements in secondary psychosocial outcomes, including anxiety (P=.001), anger (P<.001), social isolation (P=.02), insomnia (P=.007), and pain (P=.03). By contrast, the control group did not experience significant changes in these outcome domains. However, the between-group differences in secondary outcomes were not statistically significant, owing to the small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Empower@Home, a wCBT program supported by lay coaches, was more efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms than friendly telephone calls and depression symptom monitoring. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of the intervention in community and practice settings using nonclinician staff already present in these real-world settings as coaches.

Consequently, blended group therapy widens the choice within blended interventions at reasonable costs. This is the first qualitative study on blended group therapy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the patient-centered feasibility of blended group therapy for major depression, with special emphasis on the fit and dynamic interplay between face-to-face and internet-based elements. METHODS: A total of 22 patients who had a variety of experiences through participating in one of the two blended group therapy interventions were interviewed following a semistructured interview guide. In-depth interviews were analyzed by three trained psychologists, using thematic analysis and a rule-guided internet-based program (QCAmap). The transcript of the interviews (113,555 words) was reduced to 1081 coded units, with subsequent extraction of 16 themes. RESULTS: Web- and mobile-based elements were described as a treatment facilitator and motivator, increasing the salience and consolidation of cognitive behavioral therapy materials, resulting in in- and inter-session alignment to the treatment. Additionally, patients valued the option of intimate Web-based self-disclosure (by lateral patient-therapist communication), and therapists were provided with tools for between-session monitoring and reinforcement of exercising. In this context, group phenomena seemed to back up therapists' efforts to increase treatment engagement. The dissonance because of noncompliance with Web-based tasks and the constriction of in-session group interaction were considered as possible negative effects. Finally, issues of tailoring and structure seemed to fulfill different preconditions compared with individual therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Blended group therapy constitutes a structured and proactive approach to work with depression, and the integration of both modalities initiates a beneficial interplay. Results support the patient-centered value of blended group therapy and provide the first insight into blended group therapy's role in fostering therapeutic treatment factors. However, potential negative effects should be considered carefully."

Digital mental health interventions have many potential advantages, but few have been specifically designed for or rigorously evaluated with adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: This study had 2 main objectives. The first was to describe the user-centered development of a smartphone app that delivers behavioral activation (BA) to treat depression among adolescents in rural South Africa and Uganda. The second was to summarize the findings from multicycle usability testing. METHODS: An iterative user-centered agile design approach was used to co-design the app to ensure that it was engaging, culturally relevant, and usable for the target populations. An array of qualitative methods, including focus group discussions, in-depth individual interviews, participatory workshops, usability testing, and extensive expert consultation, was used to iteratively refine the app throughout each phase of development. RESULTS: A total of 160 adolescents from rural South Africa and Uganda were involved in the development process. The app was built to be consistent with the principles of BA and supported by brief weekly phone calls from peer mentors who would help users overcome barriers to engagement. Drawing on the findings of the formative work, we applied a narrative game format to develop the Kuamsha app. This approach taught the principles of BA using storytelling techniques and game design elements. The stories were developed collaboratively with adolescents from the study sites and included decision points that allowed users to shape the narrative, character personalization, in-app points, and notifications. Each story consists of 6 modules (""episodes"") played in sequential order, and each covers different BA skills. Between modules, users were encouraged to work on weekly activities and report on their progress and mood as they completed these activities. The results of the multicycle usability testing showed that the Kuamsha app was acceptable in terms of usability and engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The Kuamsha app uniquely delivered BA for adolescent depression via an interactive narrative game format tailored to the South African and Ugandan contexts. Further studies are currently underway to examine the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms."

CBT techniques can be delivered more effectively using VR as well. So far, VR has required high-quality devices, but the development of mobile VR technology has improved user availability. At the same time, a well-structured form of VR can be reproduced and used anywhere. This means that VR can be used to provide a self-guided form of treatment and address the high treatment costs of evidence-based therapy and the lack of professional therapists. This study aimed to investigate the potential of self-guided VR as an alternative to high-cost treatment. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study was to offer data about the efficacy of a mobile app-based self-led VR CBT in the treatment of panic disorder. METHODS: A total of 54 subjects with panic disorder were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to either the VR treatment group or waitlist group. The VR treatment was designed to be total 12 sessions for 4 weeks. The VR treatment consists of 4 steps in which patients are gradually exposed to phobic stimuli while learning to cope with panic symptoms in each stage. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed through the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Body Sensations Questionnaire, Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Korean Inventory of Social Avoidance and Distress Scale, Korean Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and Perceived Stress Scale. In addition, physiological changes using heart rate variability were evaluated. RESULTS: In within-group analyses, the VR treatment group exhibited improvements in panic disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression after 4 weeks, while the waitlist group did not show any significant improvement. Compared to the waitlist group, the VR treatment group showed significantly greater improvements in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale in both completer analysis and intention-to-treat analysis. Heart rate variability in the VR treatment group showed improvement in normalized high frequency from baseline to postassessment with no significant differences in any outcome measure between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The self-guided, mobile app-based VR intervention was effective in the treatment of panic symptoms and restoring the autonomic nervous system demonstrating the validity of the use of VR for self-guided treatment. VR treatment can be a cost-effective therapeutic approach. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04985019; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04985019."

10.2196/27868,"Evidence of Human-Level Bonds Established With a Digital Conversational Agent: Cross-sectional, Retrospective Observational Study","Darcy A, Daniels J, Salinger D, Wicks P, Robinson A.",JMIR Form Res,2021,2021.5.11,,,"BACKGROUND: There are far more patients in mental distress than there is time available for mental health professionals to support them. Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions' efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent. METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews. RESULTS: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=-0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45. CONCLUSIONS: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits."

Brief digital interventions have been shown to improve youth mental health, but little is known about which digital interventions are most effective. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of two digital single-session interventions (Shamiri-Digital and Digital-CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy)) among Kenyan adolescents. METHODS: We will perform a school-based comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Approximately 926 Kenyan adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Shamiri-Digital (focused on gratitude, growth mindsets and values), Digital-CBT (focused on behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring and problem solving) or a study-skills control condition (focused on note-taking and essay writing skills). The primary outcomes include depressive symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7) and subjective well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes include acceptability, appropriateness, primary control and secondary control. Acceptability and appropriateness will be measured immediately post-intervention; other outcomes will be measured 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: We hypothesise that adolescents assigned to Shamiri-Digital and adolescents assigned to Digital-CBT will experience greater improvements (assessed via hierarchical linear models) than those assigned to the control group. We will also compare Shamiri-Digital with Digital-CBT, although we do not have a preplanned hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help us evaluate two digital single-session interventions with different theoretical foundations. If effective, such interventions could be disseminated to reduce the public health burden of common mental health problems. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PACTR202011691886690."

Attention-bias modification (ABM), a cognitive-training intervention designed to reduce attention bias for threat, can be broadly disseminated using technology. We remotely tested an ABM mobile app for PTSD. Participants (N = 689) were randomly assigned to personalized ABM, nonpersonalized ABM, or placebo training. ABM was a modified dot-probe paradigm delivered daily for 12 sessions. Personalized ABM included words selected using a recommender algorithm. Placebo included only neutral words. Primary outcomes (PTSD and anxiety) and secondary outcomes (depression and PTSD clusters) were collected at baseline, after training, and at 5-week-follow-up. Mechanisms assessed during treatment were attention bias and self-reported threat sensitivity. No group differences emerged on outcomes or attention bias. Nonpersonalized ABM showed greater declines in self-reported threat sensitivity than placebo (p = .044). This study constitutes the largest mobile-based trial of ABM to date. Findings do not support the effectiveness of mobile ABM for PTSD."

Despite having the potential to overcome barriers to treatment uptake and adherence, there are very few CBT-based smartphone apps for adolescents. To address this gap, we developed ClearlyMe®, a self-guided CBT smartphone app for adolescent depression and anxiety. ClearlyMe® consists of 37 brief lessons containing core CBT elements, accessed either individually or as part of a 'collection'. Here, we describe the protocol for a randomised controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of ClearlyMe® on depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes, including engagement, anxiety and wellbeing, when delivered with and without guided support compared to an attention matched control. METHODS: We aim to recruit 489 adolescents aged 12-17 years with mild to moderately-severe depressive symptoms. Participants will be screened for inclusion, complete the baseline assessment and are then randomly allocated to receive ClearlyMe® (self-directed use), ClearlyMe® with guided SMS support (guided use) or digital psychoeducation (attention-matched control). Depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes will be assessed at 6-weeks (primary endpoint) and 4-months post-baseline (secondary endpoint). Engagement, conceptualised as uptake, adherence and completion, will also be assessed 6-weeks post-baseline. Mixed-effects linear modelling will be used to conduct intention-to-treat analyses to determine whether reductions in depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes are greater for conditions receiving ClearlyMe® relative to control at 6-weeks and 4-months post-baseline and greater for intervention adherers relative to non-adherers. To minimise risk, participants will be encouraged to use the Get Help section of the app and can also opt to receive a call from the team clinical psychologist at baseline, and at the 6-week and 4-month post-baseline assessments when reporting suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first clinical trial examining a CBT smartphone app specifically designed for adolescent depression. It will provide empirical evidence on the effects of ClearlyMe® on depressive symptoms when used with and without guided support.

Evidence-based digital mental health interventions are promising and scalable alternatives to face-to-face treatment for this population, but lack rigorous evidence to support scale-up in China. Aim: The study was a feasibility study for a large-scale RCT of Step-by-Step, a behavioral activation-based, mental health intervention to address depression and anxiety symptoms in Chinese young adults. It sought to assess feasibility of recruitment and of delivery of Step-by-Step in a University setting, to assess acceptability of the intervention, and to examine potential effectiveness. Method: An uncontrolled, feasibility trial was conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Chinese Step-by-Step for Chinese University students with elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores at or above 10) in Macao, China. Data was collected at two different time points (i.e., baseline and 8-weeks after baseline), administered via questionnaires embedded in an interventional mobile application. Participation rate and dropout rate were measured. Depressive and anxiety symptom severity, well-being, and self-defined stress were assessed. Satisfaction with the program was assessed using qualitative interviews. Results: A total of 173 students were screened, 22.0% (n = 38) were eligible, and 63.2% of them (n = 24) started the intervention. The dropout rate by post-test was 45.8%. Results from completers showed that Step-by-Step was potentially effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptom severity, and self-defined stress. Students were generally satisfied with the program, but also offered suggestions for continued improvement. Qualitative feedback was reported within the RE-AIM framework, covering recruitment, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Amendments to the program were made according to the feedback (e.g., adding notification for new session, modify the time zone). Conclusion: A minimally guided Step-by-Step protocol and the study procedure were successfully pilot tested for use for Chinese University students. The intervention was acceptable and no adverse events were reported. The results support the potential effectiveness and feasibility of a large-scale evaluation of the program."
10.1186/s12888-024-06079-2,A randomized controlled trial of a self-guided mobile app targeting repetitive negative thought to prevent depression in university students: study protocol of the Nurture-U Reducing Worry prevention trial,"Watkins ER, Phillips D, Cranston T, Choueiri H, Newton M, Cook H, Taylor G.",BMC Psychiatry,2024,2024.10.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Tackling poor mental health in university students has been identified as a priority in higher education. However, there are few evidence-based prevention initiatives designed for students. Repetitive Negative Thought (RNT, e.g. worry, rumination) is elevated in university students and is a well-established vulnerability factor for anxiety and depression. Furthermore, there are now evidence-based cognitive-behavioural interventions to tackle RNT. A mobile self-help cognitive-behavioural app targeting RNT, adapted for students may therefore be an effective, scalable, and acceptable way to improve prevention in students. METHODS: An online single blind, two-arm parallel-group Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to examine the incidence of major depression and symptoms of anxiety and depression across 12 months in university students aged over 16 who screen into the study with self-reported high levels of worry and/or rumination and no current diagnosis of major depression. Eligible participants will be randomised to the active intervention arm (usual practice plus using a self-guided mobile app targeting RNT) or to the control arm (usual practice). In total, 648 participants aged over 16, with no current major depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis will be recruited from UK universities. Assessments will take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 3 months and 12 months post- randomisation. Primary endpoint and outcome is incidence of major depression as determined by self-reported diagnostic criteria at 12-month follow-up. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and academic outcomes are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events, and potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored. DISCUSSION: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the causal role of tackling RNT (worry, rumination) using a self-help mobile app with respect to preventing depression in university students. This knowledge will be used to develop and disseminate innovative evidence-based, feasible, and effective mobile-health public health strategies for preventing common mental health problems.

10.2196/14734,Wearable Digital Sensors to Identify Risks of Postpartum Depression and Personalize Psychological Treatment for Adolescent Mothers: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Exploratory Study in Rural Nepal,"Poudyal A, van Heerden A, Hagaman A, Maharjan SM, Byanjankar P, Subba P, Kohrt BA.",JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019.9.13,,,"Erratum in JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Oct 30;8(10):e16837. doi: 10.2196/16837. BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of untreated postpartum depression among adolescent mothers with the greatest gap in services in low- and middle-income countries. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of nonspecialists to provide mental health services for postpartum depression in these low-resource settings. However, there is inconsistency in short-term and long-term benefits from the interventions. Passive sensing data generated from wearable digital devices can be used to more accurately distinguish which mothers will benefit from psychological services. In addition, wearable digital sensors can be used to passively collect data to personalize care for mothers. Therefore, wearable passive sensing technology has the potential to improve outcomes from psychological treatments for postpartum depression. OBJECTIVE: This study will explore the use of wearable digital sensors for two objectives: First, we will pilot test using wearable sensors to generate passive sensing data that distinguish adolescent mothers with depression from those without depression. Second, we will explore how nonspecialists can integrate data from passive sensing technologies to better personalize psychological treatment. METHODS: This study will be conducted in rural Nepal with participatory involvement of adolescent mothers and health care stakeholders through a community advisory board. The first study objective will be addressed by comparing behavioral patterns of adolescent mothers without depression (n=20) and with depression (n=20). The behavioral patterns will be generated by wearable digital devices collecting data in 4 domains: (1) the physical activity of mothers using accelerometer data on mobile phones, (2) the geographic range and routine of mothers using GPS (Global Positioning System) data collected from mobile phones, (3) the time and routine of adolescent mothers with their infants using proximity data collected from Bluetooth beacons, and (4) the verbal stimulation and auditory environment for mothers and infants using episodic audio recordings on mobile phones. For the second objective, the same 4 domains of data will be collected and shared with nonspecialists who are delivering an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention to the depressed adolescent mothers. Over 5 weeks of the intervention, we will document how passive sensing data are used by nonspecialists to personalize the intervention. In addition, qualitative data on feasibility and acceptability of passive data collection will be collected for both objectives. RESULTS: To date, a community advisory board comprising young women and health workers engaged with adolescent mothers has been established. The study is open for recruitment, and data collection is anticipated to be completed in November 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of passive sensing data in public health and clinical programs for mothers at risk of perinatal mental health problems has the potential to more accurately identify who will benefit from services and increase the effectiveness by personalizing psychological interventions.

10.2196/51066,Acceptability and Utility of a Digital Group Intervention to Prevent Perinatal Depression in Youths via Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support (IMAGINE): Pilot Cohort Study,"Ronen K, Gewali A, Dachelet K, White E, Jean-Baptiste M, Evans YN, Unger JA, Tandon SD, Bhat A.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.2.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum) affects 10%-25% of perinatal individuals, with a higher risk among youths aged <25 years. The Mothers and Babies Course (MB) is an evidence-based intervention for the prevention of perinatal depression, grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy, attachment theory, and psychoeducation. OBJECTIVE: We developed a digital adaptation of MB (Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support [IMAGINE]) and evaluated it in a pre-post mixed methods pilot among young perinatal people in the United States. METHODS: IMAGINE was a structured digital group of up to 7 participants, with scheduled MB content and open discussion for 12 weeks, facilitated by a social worker. Scheduled content included asynchronous SMS text messages, graphics, prerecorded videos, mood polls, and optional weekly synchronous video calls. Eligible participants were pregnant or ≤80 days postpartum, aged 16 to 24 years, had access to a smartphone, spoke English, and had a Patient Health Questionnaire score <10. Participants were recruited throughout the United States from August 2020 to January 2021 through paid social media ads, in-person outreach at clinics, and respondent-driven sampling. Participants completed quantitative questionnaires at enrollment and 3 months, and qualitative interviews at 3 months. We determined uptake, acceptability (by Acceptability of Intervention Measure score), and utility (by use of cognitive behavioral therapy skills). We compared depression symptoms (by Patient Health Questionnaire score), social support (by abbreviated Social Support Behavior score), and perceived stress (by Perceived Stress Score) between enrollment and follow-up by paired 2-tailed t test. RESULTS: Among 68 individuals who contacted this study, 22 were screened, 13 were eligible, and 10 enrolled, for an uptake of 76.9%. Furthermore, 4 (40%) participants were pregnant at enrollment. Participants had a median age of 17.9 (IQR 17.4-21.7) years, 6 (67%) identified as Black, 5 (56%) Latinx, and 6 (67%) using Medicaid health insurance. Further, 9 (90%) participants completed follow-up. Among these, the mean acceptability score was 4.3 out of 5 (SD 0.6) and all participants said they would recommend IMAGINE to a friend. Participants reported using a median of 7 of 11 skills (IQR 5-7 skills) at least half the days. We found no significant changes in depression symptoms, perceived stress, or social support. Qualitatively, participants reported one-to-one support from the facilitator, connection with other parents, and regular mood reflection were especially helpful aspects of the intervention. Additionally, participants reported that the intervention normalized their mental health challenges, improved their ability to manage their mood, and increased their openness to mental health care. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides promising evidence of the acceptability and utility of IMAGINE among perinatal youths. Our study's small sample size did not detect changes in clinical outcomes; our findings suggest IMAGINE warrants larger-scale evaluation."
10.2196/44210,Layperson-Facilitated Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Homebound Older Adults With Depression: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Kayser J, Wang X, Wu Z, Dimoji A, Xiang X.",JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023.2.22,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression in older adults has serious biological, psychological, and social consequences. Homebound older adults experience a high burden of depression and significant barriers to accessing mental health treatments. Few interventions to address their specific needs have been developed. Existing treatment modalities can be challenging to scale up, are not tailored to unique population concerns, and require significant staffing support. Technology-assisted, layperson-facilitated psychotherapy has the potential to overcome these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a layperson-facilitated internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program tailored for homebound older adults. The novel intervention, Empower@Home, was developed based on user-centered design principles and partnerships between researchers, social service agencies, care recipients, and other stakeholders serving low-income homebound older adults. METHODS: This 2-arm, 20-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a waitlist control crossover design aims to enroll 70 community-dwelling older adults with elevated depressive symptoms. The treatment group will receive the 10-week intervention immediately, whereas the waitlist control group will cross over and receive the intervention after 10 weeks. This pilot is part of a multiphase project involving a single-group feasibility study (completed in December 2022). This project consists of a pilot RCT (described in this protocol) and an implementation feasibility study running in parallel with the pilot RCT. The primary clinical outcome of the pilot is the change in depressive symptoms after the intervention and at the 20-week postrandomization follow-up. Additional outcomes include acceptability, adherence, and changes in anxiety, social isolation, and quality of life. RESULTS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for the proposed trial in April 2022. Recruitment for the pilot RCT began in January 2023 and is anticipated to end in September 2023. On completion of the pilot trial, we will examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on depression symptoms and other secondary clinical outcomes in an intention-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although web-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs are available, most programs have low adherence and very few are tailored for older adults. Our intervention addresses this gap. Older adults, particularly those with mobility difficulties and multiple chronic health conditions, could benefit from internet-based psychotherapy. This approach can serve a pressing need in society while being cost-effective, scalable, and convenient. This pilot RCT builds on a completed single-group feasibility study by determining the preliminary effects of the intervention compared with a control condition. The findings will provide a foundation for a future fully-powered randomized controlled efficacy trial. If our intervention is found to be effective, implications extend to other digital mental health interventions and populations with physical disabilities and access restrictions who face persistent disparities in mental health.

10.2196/56418,Depression Self-Care Apps' Characteristics and Applicability to Older Adults: Systematic Assessment,"Yin R, Rajappan D, Martinengo L, Chan FHF, Smith H, Griva K, Subramaniam M, Tudor Car L.",J Med Internet Res,2025,2025.2.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression affects 32% of older adults. Loneliness and social isolation are common risk factors for depression in older adults. Mobile apps can connect users and are also effective in depression management in the general population. However, older adults have specific needs in terms of the content of depression self-care interventions and their accessibility. It remains unknown whether existing apps for depression self-care are applicable to older adults. OBJECTIVE: The initial aim of this assessment was to systematically identify interactive depression self-care apps specifically designed for older adults. As we did not find any, we assessed the applicability of existing depression self-care apps to the needs of older adult users. METHODS: Using an established app assessment methodology, we searched for Android and iOS interactive mental health apps providing self-care for depression in English and Chinese in the 42Matters database, Chinese Android app stores, and the first 10 pages of Google and Baidu. We developed an assessment rubric based on extensive revision of the literature. The rubric consisted of the following sections: general characteristics of the apps (eg, developer, platform, and category), app content (eg, epidemiology and risk factors of depression in older adults, techniques to improve mood and well-being), and technical aspects (eg, accessibility, privacy and confidentiality, and engagement). RESULTS: We identified 23 apps (n=19, 82.6%, English and n=4, 17.4%, Chinese apps), with 5 (21.7%) iOS-only apps, 3 (13%) Android-only apps, and 15 (65.2%) apps on both platforms. None specifically targeted older adults with depression. All apps were designed by commercial companies and were free to download. Most of the apps incorporated cognitive behavior therapy, mood monitoring, or journaling. All but 3 (13%) apps had a privacy and confidentiality policy. In addition, 14 (60.9%) apps covered depression risk factors in older adults, and 3 (13%) apps delivered information about depression epidemiology in older adults via a chatbot. Furthermore, 17 (73.9%) apps mentioned other topics relevant to older adults, such as pain management, grief, loneliness, and social isolation. Around 30% (n=7) of the apps were supported by an online forum. Common accessibility issues included a lack of adaptations for users with visual or hearing impairments and incompatibility with larger font sizes in the phone settings. CONCLUSIONS: There are no depression apps developed specifically for older adults. Available mobile apps have limited applicability to older adults in terms of their clinical and technical features. Depression self-care apps should aim to incorporate content relevant to older adults, such as grief and loss; include online communities; and improve accessibility to adapt to potential health impairments in older adults."

METHOD: A recent controlled trial (ECoWeB-PREVENT) randomized young people aged 16-22, at increased risk for depression because of elevated worry/rumination, negative appraisals, and/or rejection sensitivity but without past or current history of major depression, to apps that provided self-monitoring, self-monitoring plus CBT self-help, or self-monitoring plus emotional competency self-help. Self-help included coping strategies for moment-by-moment use (Tools) and self-learning/planning exercises (Challenges). On the primary outcome (depression, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3-months follow-up (primary endpoint), only the CBT app outperformed self-monitoring. In this secondary analysis, only data from participants who used the CBT or self-monitoring apps at least once were analyzed to test what app use predicted change in depression from baseline to 3 months. RESULTS: Of the original 1,262 participants (79% female), 558 were included (CBT, baseline, n = 273, PHQ-9: M = 7.48, SD = 3.9; 3 months, N = 163, PHQ-9: M = 8.83, SD = 4.92; self-monitoring, baseline, n = 285, PHQ-9: M = 7.45, SD = 4.26; 3 months, N = 183, PHQ-9: M = 7.48, SD = 3.9). Neither total app use, self-monitoring, nor use of Tools predicted change in depression (all ps > .05). Frequency of use of Challenges predicted lower depression symptoms and caseness at 3 months (β = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.53, -0.03], p = .029). Specifically, the use of behavioral activation challenges mediated the effects of the CBT app on depression over 3 months (β = -0.59, 95% CI [-1.13, -0.05], p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Brief psychoeducation about behavioral activation principles in an app may protect young people from depression over 3 months, even when only used once.

METHOD: The study was a randomized controlled trial carried out in Kunming, China, and involved the recruitment of 138 active firefighters as participants. The intervention lasted for an 8-week duration, during which participants participated in ABM exercises on alternating days and concurrently underwent eight modules of iCBT courses delivered through a smartphone application. Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted to evaluate the effects of the intervention. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results indicated that the combined iCBT and ABM intervention was significantly effective in reducing symptoms of depression compared with the no intervention control group (U=1644, p<0.001, Wilcoxon r=0.280). No significant change was observed in attention bias post-intervention (U=2460, p=0.737, Wilcoxon r=0.039), while a significant increase was observed in attention-bias variability (U=3172, p<0.001, Wilcoxon r=-0.287). This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of the combined iCBT and ABM intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among firefighters. This study provides conceptual support and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of the combined iCBT and ABM intervention in reducing depressive symptoms among firefighters."
10.1186/s12888-021-03222-1,Effectiveness of a digital alcohol moderation intervention as an add-on to depression treatment for young adults: study protocol of a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Schouten MJE, Dekker JJM, de Bruijn TQ, Ebert DD, Koomen LM, Kosterman SLA, Riper H, Schaub MP, Goudriaan AE, Blankers M.",BMC Psychiatry,2021,2021.5.23,,,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders and problematic drinking often co-occur, also among young adults. These co-occurring conditions are associated with various negative health outcomes compared to both conditions alone. Early intervention by addressing alcohol use and depressive symptoms simultaneously in the same treatment might improve both conditions. However, evidence on the (cost-) effectiveness of digital combined depression and alcohol interventions for young adults is currently insufficient. We therefore developed an add-on digital alcohol moderation adherence-focussed guided intervention to complement treatment as usual (TAU) for depressive disorders. The digital intervention is a web-app, including 6 modules based on motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy. This study aims to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a digital alcohol moderation intervention + TAU compared to TAU on alcohol and depression outcomes among young adults with co-occurring depressive disorders and problematic alcohol use. METHODS: One hundred fifty-six participants, aged 18-35 years, with problematic alcohol use and a diagnosed depressive disorder will participate in a pragmatic multicentre two-arm randomized controlled trial. Problematic alcohol use is operationalised as scoring ≥5 for women and ≥ 8 for men on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Participants will be randomized to either the experimental group (digital alcohol intervention + TAU) or control group (TAU only). Participants will be recruited at three Dutch mental health care centres and through social media. Assessments take place at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomization. The primary outcome is treatment response at 6-month follow-up, operationalized as a composite score that combines alcohol use and depression measures and indicates whether treatment has been successful or not. Secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms and alcohol use (i.e. number of weekly standard drinks and AUDIT score). An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates the (cost-) effectiveness of an add-on digital alcohol moderation intervention for young adults who are in treatment for depressive disorders. If proven effective, the digital intervention could be implemented in mental health care and improve treatment for people with co-occurring depressive disorders and problematic alcohol use.

10.1016/j.invent.2023.100678,Increasing the accessibility to internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for depression: A single-blind randomized controlled trial of condensed versus full-text versions,"Karlsson-Good M, Kaldo V, Lundberg L, Kraepelien M, Anthony SA, Holländare F.",Internet Interv,2023,2023.10.16,,,"BACKGROUND: Research shows that internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) is an effective treatment for depression. However, little is known about how the length of the text material in iCBT affects outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether a condensed iCBT version for depression would be non-inferior to the existing full-text version in reducing depressive symptoms at post-treatment. We also wanted to test non-inferiority for secondary outcomes and explore reading speed and ADHD symptoms as potential moderators. METHOD: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted (N = 267) comparing two versions of guided iCBT for depression; full-text (around 60,000 words) and condensed (around 30,000 words, with the option to listen to the text). Estimated between-group effect sizes and their confidence intervals for depression, anxiety and quality of life, were compared to a pre-determined non-inferiority margin (ES = 0.4). Moderation analyses of reading speed and ADHD symptoms were conducted. RESULTS: The condensed version of iCBT was non-inferior to the full-text version on post-treatment measures for depressive symptoms (95 % CI = -0.42-0.24), anxiety symptoms (95 % CI = -0.24-0.32), and quality of life (95 % CI = -0.09-0.49). Non-inferiority was inconclusive for depressive symptoms at the one-year follow-up (95 % CI = -0.60-0.47). There was no significant moderation effects of reading speed (p = 0.06) or ADHD symptoms (p = 0.11) on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a condensed version of iCBT for depression is as effective at treating depression as the full-text version. By shortening texts, iCBT may be made available to more people. Due to unequal dropout rates between the groups, these results are preliminary and need to be replicated."

The purpose of the Synergy Study is to test the efficacy of a mobile health combined behavior intervention targeting physical activity and sleep quality. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, waitlist-controlled trial. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This study had an app-based delivery mode, Australia-wide. The participants were 160 adults who reported insufficient physical activity and poor sleep quality in an eligibility survey. INTERVENTION: The intervention was a mobile app providing educational resources, goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback strategies. It included 12 weeks of personalized support including weekly reports, tool sheets, and prompts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary), and 6 months (secondary endpoint). Self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and sleep quality were co-primary outcomes. Resistance training; sitting time; sleep hygiene; sleep timing variability; insomnia severity; daytime sleepiness; quality of life; and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were secondary outcomes. Data were collected between June 2017 and February 2018 and analyzed in August 2018. RESULTS: At 3 months, between-group differences in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity were not statistically significant (p=0.139). Significantly more participants in the intervention group engaged in ≥2 days/week (p=0.004) of resistance training. The intervention group reported better overall sleep quality (p=0.009), subjective sleep quality (p=0.017), sleep onset latency (p=0.013), waketime variability (p=0.018), sleep hygiene (p=0.027), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and lower stress symptoms (p=0.032) relative to waitlist controls. At 6 months, group differences were maintained for sleep hygiene (p=0.048), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and stress symptoms (p=0.006). Differences were observed for bedtime variability (p=0.023), sleepiness (p<0.001), daytime dysfunction (p=0.039), and anxiety symptoms (p=0.003) at 6 months, but not 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: This remotely delivered intervention did not produce statistically significant between-group differences in minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Significant short-term differences in resistance training and short- and medium-term differences in sleep health in favor of the intervention were observed.

This study aimed to use a smartphone-based ambulatory assessment to examine real-time relationships between depressed mood and functional behaviors among individuals with stroke. METHODS: A total of 202 participants with mild-to-moderate stroke (90% ischemic, 45% female, 44% Black) completed an ecological momentary assessment five times per day for 2 weeks by reporting their depressed mood and functional behaviors regarding where, with whom, and what activity was spent. RESULTS: Participants spent 28% of their wake-up time participating in passive leisure activities but spent the least time in physical (4%) and vocational (9%) activities. Depressed mood was concurrently lower when participants engaged in social activities (β = -0.023 ± 0.011) and instrumental activities of daily living (β = -0.061 ± 0.013); spent time with family members (β = -0.061 ± 0.014), spouses (β = -0.043, ± 0.016), friends (β = -0.094, ± 0.021), and coworkers (β = -0.050 ± 0.021); and were located in restaurants (β = -0.068 ± 0.029), and homes of family members (β = -0.039 ± 0.020) or friends (β = -0.069 ± 0.031). Greater depressed mood was associated with worse ratings in satisfaction, performance, and engagement of activities in concurrent (βs = -0.036 ± 0.003, -0.053 ± 0.003, -0.044 ± 0.003) and time-lagged models (βs = -0.011 ± 0.004, -0.012 ± 0.004, -0.013 ± 0.004). DISCUSSION: Smartphone-based ambulatory assessment can elucidate functional behaviors and associated mood after stroke. Findings support behavioral activation treatments to schedule social and instrumental activities for stroke survivors to reduce their depressed mood."
10.1002/wps.20673,The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Linardon J, Cuijpers P, Carlbring P, Messer M, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M.",World Psychiatry,2019,2019.9.10,,,"Although impressive progress has been made toward developing empirically-supported psychological treatments, the reality remains that a significant proportion of people with mental health problems do not receive these treatments. Finding ways to reduce this treatment gap is crucial. Since app-supported smartphone interventions are touted as a possible solution, access to up-to-date guidance around the evidence base and clinical utility of these interventions is needed. We conducted a meta-analysis of 66 randomized controlled trials of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems. Smartphone interventions significantly outperformed control conditions in improving depressive (g=0.28, n=54) and generalized anxiety (g=0.30, n=39) symptoms, stress levels (g=0.35, n=27), quality of life (g=0.35, n=43), general psychiatric distress (g=0.40, n=12), social anxiety symptoms (g=0.58, n=6), and positive affect (g=0.44, n=6), with most effects being robust even after adjusting for various possible biasing factors (type of control condition, risk of bias rating). Smartphone interventions conferred no significant benefit over control conditions on panic symptoms (g=-0.05, n=3), post-traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.18, n=4), and negative affect (g=-0.08, n=5). Studies that delivered a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based app and offered professional guidance and reminders to engage produced larger effects on multiple outcomes. Smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active interventions (face-to-face, computerized treatment), although the number of studies was low (n≤13). The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for common mental health problems was thus confirmed. Although mental health apps are not intended to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the potential of apps to serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low intensity intervention for those who cannot receive standard psychological treatment."
10.1089/tmj.2025.0057,Comparative Efficacy of Telepsychiatry Interventions for Depression in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis,"Senachai C, Upakdee N, Dhippayom T, Lueyam W, Dilokthornsakul P.",Telemed J E Health,2025,2025.5.2,,,"Background: Depression represents a major public health burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Telepsychiatry provides a promising solution by offering remote mental health services, overcoming barriers such as limited resources, isolation, and cost. This study aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different telepsychiatry interventions in LMICs by network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses from inception to May 2024 to identify all relevant studies. Telepsychiatry interventions were categorized as: (1) CBTAppGuided, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app with professional guidance; (2) CBTChatBot, a CBT app that uses a chatbot for guidance; (3) CBTApp, a CBT app without professional guidance; (4) Reminder; and (5) Consultation. Study quality was assessed according to the Effective Practice and Organization of Care guideline. Depression severity was calculated using summary standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Seven RCTs were included with a total of 1,469 adults (mean age range: 16.0-35.64 years). Compared with face-to-face usual care, the most effective telepsychiatry intervention was CBTAppGuided [-23.04, 95% CI: -26.12 to -19.96], followed by CBTChatBot [-5.27, 95% CI: -6.25 to -4.29]. Other interventions, including CBTApp [-0.83, 95% CI: -1.32 to -0.34], Reminder [-0.44, 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.16], and Consultation [-0.27, 95% CI: -0.78 to 0.26], demonstrated smaller effects. CBTAppGuided, CBTChatBot, CBTApp, and Reminder achieved statistically significant improvement, whereas Consultation did not show statistically significant improvement and was not different from face-to-face treatment. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry interventions, particularly CBTAppGuided, show potential for reducing depression severity in LMICs, with promising outcomes for both guided and unguided app-based formats. Further research is needed to confirm their effectiveness in resource-limited settings."

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based mobile application in ameliorating depressive symptoms among college students. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted at three universities. Undergraduates aged ≥ 20 years with self-reported depressive symptoms were recruited and randomly assigned to the control and intervention groups. The outcomes include changes in depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, help-seeking attitudes and emotional self-awareness at 4 (T1), 8 (T2) and 12 (T3) weeks. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 91 participants, 46 in the intervention group exhibited a significant decline in depressive symptoms at T1 and lower patterns of symptom changes at T2 and T3. No significant differences were observed in the other outcomes; however, higher help-seeking attitude, emotional self-awareness and lower suicidal ideation after T0 were observed for those who used the application for 12 weeks. DISCUSSION: The advantages of a brief application-based intervention to promote college students' psychological health are outlined. IMPLICATIONS: School nursing managers could use the application to improve the college mental health systems and support collegial teacher-student relationships. RECOMMENDATIONS: Further studies should enhance application usage to manage depressive symptoms.

Thus, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a 24-week walking program on reducing depressive symptoms and acculturative stress levels in this population. This quasi-experimental sequential walking program was conducted with 132 Korean-Chinese women over a period of 24 weeks. Participants were divided into either a standard treatment group (n = 69) or enhanced treatment group (n = 63). All participants were instructed to walk using a pedometer. The enhanced treatment group also received mobile text messages designed to encourage walking adherence and improve acculturation. Participants were asked to complete two structured questionnaires, the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Acculturative Stress Scale, to evaluate the intervention programs. At the end of the program, both groups exhibited decreased depression scores, but the decrease in the enhanced treatment group was more significant both at weeks 12 and 24. Acculturative stress was also found to have decreased at weeks 12 and 24. Our findings show the walking program reduced the depressive symptoms and acculturative stress levels among the Korean-Chinese women in this study. Further studies will be needed to analyze the relationship between walking step count and mental health considering exercise intensity."

Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as phone apps, can be a potential solution to this issue by enabling broader and more affordable reach, thus addressing the problem of limited access to care. This study evaluates the effectiveness of evidence-based health apps on user mental health outcomes, particularly depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE databases. In total, 6894 studies were identified, and 38 studies were selected for the review-thirty out of 38 studies employed randomized controlled trial designs. We identified 35 unique mobile apps. All the apps leveraged Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based approaches. The most common approaches were context engagement and cognitive change, highlighting a significant focus on using personalized engagement activities and empowering users to alter their perspectives and reframe negative thoughts to improve their mental health. While mental health apps generally positively impact mental health outcomes, the findings also highlight significant variability in their effectiveness. Future studies should prioritize long-term effectiveness, wider reach to ensure it suits a diverse range of people, and the employment of objective evaluation methodologies."

This condition is characterized by a notably high risk of lapses and relapses, even subsequent to treatment interventions. Mobile health interventions, owing to their widespread accessibility, emerge as a promising approach to diminish the risk of relapse post-treatment and to broaden the scope of care, especially in regions with a scarcity of trained medical professionals. METHOD: This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of mobile interventions in mitigating cravings and preventing lapses among individuals diagnosed with SUD. Employing a two-armed, randomized controlled trial framework, the study will evaluate a self-administered psychological intervention delivered through a mobile application, Nałogometr 2.0. Over a period of three months, participants will engage with intervention modules that primarily incorporate mindfulness techniques and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) will be utilized to gather longitudinal data on a range of variables that are indicative of craving intensity and the risk of lapse. In addition to this, a monthly-administered battery of questionnaires will be employed to gauge the severity of substance dependence, as well as to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and overall life satisfaction.

However, the traditional face-to-face delivery format limits its accessibility. With the advent of digital technology, app-based CBT offers new possibilities, yet its preventive role in perinatal depression remains insufficiently explored. This study aims to determine if pregnant women using an app-based CBT program report reduced depressive and anxious symptoms compared to a control group. METHODS: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial of 290 pregnant women will be conducted at Jintang County Maternity and Child Health Hospital in Chengdu, China. Eligible participants who consent to participate will be recruited at 20-24 weeks of gestation and randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which will complete an 8-week mobile app-based CBT program (CareMom), or a control group, which will receive an attention-matched 8-week relaxation training program, also delivered via a mobile app. Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random number sequence. Primary outcomes include changes in scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item from baseline to 6 weeks postpartum. Outcome analyses will be performed on both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. DISCUSSION: This trial evaluates an app-based CBT program for reducing the risk of perinatal depression. Improved maternal mental health not only benefits the mothers themselves but also may facilitate more optimal parenting behaviors, which could exert a positive influence on the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development of the infant.

Mobile behavioral activation (BA) is efficacious for the treatment of perinatal depression; however, the effect of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) on symptom trajectories remains underexplored. This is important given that at least 10% of women in the perinatal period experience CAD. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether there were differences in symptom trajectories in pregnant participants with CAD as compared to those with depression only (ie, major depressive disorder [MDD]) during intervention with a BA mobile gaming app. METHODS: Pregnant adults with either CAD (n=10) or MDD (n=7) used a BA app for 10 weeks and completed biweekly symptom severity questionnaires for depression and anxiety. We assessed whether baseline diagnoses were associated with differential symptom trajectories across the study with mixed effects longitudinal models. RESULTS: When controlling for baseline symptoms, results revealed a significant interaction between baseline diagnosis and the quadratic component of study week on anxiety (β=.18, SE 0.07; t62=2.61; P=.01), revealing a tendency for anxiety in the CAD group to increase initially and then decrease at an accelerated rate, whereas MDD symptoms were relatively stable across time. There was a significant effect of linear time on depression (β=-.39, SE 0.11; t68=-3.51; P=.001), showing that depression declined steadily across time for both groups. There was a significant effect of baseline diagnosis on depression (β=-8.53, SE 3.93; t13=-2.17; P=.05), suggesting that those with MDD had higher follow-up depression compared to those with CAD when holding other predictors constant. CONCLUSIONS: The app was beneficial in reducing depression symptoms in perinatal individuals with different comorbidity profiles. With respect to anxiety symptom trajectories, however, there was more variability. The app may be especially effective for the treatment of anxiety symptoms among individuals with CAD, as it encourages in-the-moment ecologically relevant exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli. Despite no significant group difference in baseline anxiety symptoms, the MDD group did not have a significant reduction in their anxiety symptoms across the study period, and some individuals had an increase in anxiety. Findings may point to opportunities for the augmentation of BA gaming apps for those with MDD to more effectively target anxiety symptoms. Overall, findings suggest there may be value in considering comorbidities and individual variations in participants when developing scalable mobile interventions for perinatal populations."

However, the extent to which psychological guidance increases the efficacy of these apps is controversial. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy of a web-based intervention, called Selfapy, for unipolar depression. We also investigated differences between psychotherapist-guided and unguided versions. METHODS: Selfapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention for depressive disorders. Participants with mild-to-severe depressive disorders were assigned randomly to participate in either guided (weekly 25-minute duration telephone calls) intervention, unguided version, or waiting list (control group) for 12 weeks. We assessed depressive symptoms at the start of the study, midway through the intervention (6 weeks), at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), and at follow-up (6 months). The main outcome was difference in the Beck Depression Inventory score between the start of the study and the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report, the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS: Of 401 participants, 301 participants (75.1%) completed the intervention. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory from baseline differed significantly between groups at the postintervention (F2,398=37.20, P<.001). The reductions in scores for both guided and unguided intervention groups were greater than that for the control group, with large between-group effect sizes (guided vs control: d=1.63, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.93; unguided vs control: d=1.47, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73) at postintervention. No significant differences were found between guided and unguided intervention groups (P=.18). At follow-up (6 months), treatment effects on the primary outcome were maintained for both intervention groups (guided: F1,194=0.62, P>.999; unguided: F1,176=0.13, P>.999). CONCLUSIONS: Both guided and unguided versions of the intervention were highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Follow-up data suggest that these effects could be maintained.

Mobile mental health programs have been found to provide support to nonclinical populations and may overcome some of the barriers associated with traditional in-person treatment; however, researchers have voiced concerns that many publicly available mobile mental health programs lack evidence-based theoretical foundations, peer-reviewed research, and sufficient engagement from the public. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of Noom Mood, a commercial mobile cognitive behavioral therapy- and mindfulness-based program. METHODS: In this single-arm prospective cohort study, individuals who joined Noom Mood between August and October 2021 completed surveys at baseline and 4-week follow-up. Per-protocol analyses included those who completed both surveys (n=113), and intention-to-treat analyses included all participants (N=185). RESULTS: A majority of the sample reported that the program is easy to use, they felt confident recommending the program to a friend, and they perceived the program to be effective at improving stress and anxiety. There were significant improvements in anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, depressive feelings, emotion regulation, and optimism in both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses (all P<.001). Participants reported benefiting most from learning skills (eg, breathing and cognitive reframing techniques), interacting with the program features, and gaining awareness of their emotions and thought patterns. Participants also made a number of suggestions to improve product functionality and usability. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that Noom Mood is feasible and acceptable to participants, with promising preliminary outcomes. Future studies should build on these results to evaluate the effects of Noom Mood using more rigorous designs."
10.2196/36431,Online Video Teletherapy Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Using Exposure and Response Prevention: Clinical Outcomes From a Retrospective Longitudinal Observational Study,"Feusner JD, Farrell NR, Kreyling J, McGrath PB, Rhode A, Faneuff T, Lonsway S, Mohideen R, Jurich JE, Trusky L, Smith SM.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.5.19,,,"BACKGROUND: Exposure and response prevention, a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy, is an effective first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite extensive evidence of the efficacy of exposure and response prevention (ERP) from clinical studies and in real-world samples, it is still underused as a treatment. This is likely due to the limits to access to care that include the availability of adequately trained therapists, as well as geographical location, time, and cost barriers. To address these, NOCD created a digital behavioral health treatment for OCD using ERP delivered via video teletherapy and with technology-assisted elements including app-based therapy tools and between-session therapist messaging. OBJECTIVE: We examined treatment outcomes in a large naturalistic sample of 3552 adults with a primary OCD diagnosis who received NOCD treatment. METHODS: The treatment model consisted of twice-weekly, live, face-to-face video teletherapy ERP for 3 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of once-weekly brief video teletherapy check-ins for 30 minutes. Assessments were conducted at baseline, at midpoint after completion of 3 weeks of twice-weekly sessions, and at the end of 6 weeks of brief check-ins (endpoint). Longitudinal assessments were also obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after endpoint. RESULTS: Treatment resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements, with a 43.4% mean reduction in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (g=1.0; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03) and a 62.9% response rate. Treatment also resulted in a 44.2% mean reduction in depression, a 47.8% mean reduction in anxiety, and a 37.3% mean reduction in stress symptoms. Quality of life improved by a mean of 22.7%. Reduction in OCD symptoms and response rates were similar for those with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. The mean duration of treatment was 11.5 (SD 4.0) weeks, and the mean total therapist time was 10.6 (SD 1.1) hours. Improvements were maintained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, representing the largest reported treated cohort of patients with OCD to date, video teletherapy treatment demonstrated effectiveness in reducing obsessive-compulsive and comorbid symptoms and improved quality of life. Further, it achieved meaningful results in less than half the total therapist time compared with standard once-weekly outpatient treatment, an efficiency that represents substantial monetary and time savings. The effect size was large and similar to studies of in-person ERP. This technology-assisted remote treatment is readily accessible for patients, offering an advancement in the field in the dissemination of effective evidence-based care for OCD."

Most psychotherapy studies measure activity levels and symptoms solely using self-report scales, administered periodically. These scales may not capture granular changes during treatment. We introduce the potential utility of passive sensing data collected with smartphone to assess fluctuations in daily functioning in real time during psychotherapy for late life depression in elder abuse victims. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of passive sensing among depressed elder abuse victims. We present data from three victims who received a 9-week intervention as part of a pilot randomized controlled trial and showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (50% reduction). Using a smartphone, we tracked participants' daily number of smartphone unlocks, time spent at home, time spent in conversation, and step count over treatment. Independent assessment of depressive symptoms and behavioral activation were collected at intake, Weeks 6 and 9. Data revealed patient-level fluctuations in activity level over treatment, corresponding with self-reported behavioral activation. We demonstrate how passive sensing data could expand our understanding of heterogenous presentations of late-life depression among elder abuse. We illustrate how trajectories of change in activity levels as measured with passive sensing and subjective measures can be tracked concurrently over time. We outline challenges and potential solutions for application of passive sensing data collection in future studies with larger samples using novel advanced statistical modeling, such as artificial intelligence algorithms."

While prior research has identified stable patient-level predictors of attendance, far less is known about dynamic (i.e., time-varying) factors. Identifying dynamic predictors can clarify how clinical states relate to psychotherapy attendance and inform effective ""just-in-time"" interventions to promote attendance. The present study examines whether daily mood, as measured by responses to automated mobile phone-based text messages, prospectively predicts attendance in group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. Fifty-six Spanish-speaking Latino patients with elevated depressive symptoms (46 women, mean age=50.92years, SD=10.90years), enrolled in a manualized program of group CBT, received daily automated mood-monitoring text messages. Patients' daily mood ratings, message response rate, and delay in responding were recorded. Patients' self-reported mood the day prior to a scheduled psychotherapy session significantly predicted attendance, even after controlling for patients' prior attendance history and age (OR=1.33, 95% CI [1.04, 1.70], p=.02). Positive mood corresponded to a greater likelihood of attendance. Our results demonstrate the clinical utility of automated mood-monitoring text messages in predicting attendance. These results underscore the value of text messaging, and other mobile technologies, as adjuncts to psychotherapy. Future work should explore the use of such monitoring to guide interventions to increase attendance, and ultimately the efficacy of psychotherapy."

Strong evidence suggests that brief cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-based mental health apps can decrease depressive symptoms, yet there is limited research elucidating the specific features that may augment its therapeutic benefits. One potential design feature that may influence effectiveness and user experience is the inclusion of virtual agents that can mimic realistic, human face-to-face interactions. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current experiment was to determine the effect of conversational and animation features of a virtual agent within a bCBT-based mental health app on depressive symptoms and user experience in college students with and without depressive symptoms. METHODS: College students (N=209) completed a 2-week intervention in which they engaged with a bCBT-based mental health app with a customizable therapeutic virtual agent that varied in conversational and animation features. A 2 (time: baseline vs 2-week follow-up) × 2 (conversational vs non-conversational agent) × 2 (animated vs non-animated agent) randomized controlled trial was used to assess mental health symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8, Perceived Stress Scale-10, and Response Rumination Scale questionnaires) and user experience (mHealth App Usability Questionnaire, MAUQ) in college students with and without current depressive symptoms. The mental health app usability and qualitative questions regarding users' perceptions of their therapeutic virtual agent interactions and customization process were assessed at follow-up. RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA (analysis of variance) results demonstrated a significant decrease in symptoms of depression (P=.002; mean [SD]=5.5 [4.86] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=6.35 [4.71] at baseline), stress (P=.005; mean [SD]=15.91 [7.67] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=17.02 [6.81] at baseline), and rumination (P=.03; mean [SD]=40.42 [12.96] at follow-up vs mean [SD]=41.92 [13.61] at baseline); however, no significant effect of conversation or animation was observed. Findings also indicate a significant increase in user experience in animated conditions. This significant increase in animated conditions is also reflected in the user's ease of use and satisfaction (F(1, 201)=102.60, P<.001), system information arrangement (F(1, 201)=123.12, P<.001), and usefulness of the application (F(1, 201)=3667.62, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The current experiment provides support for bCBT-based mental health apps featuring customizable, humanlike therapeutic virtual agents and their ability to significantly reduce negative symptomology over a brief timeframe. The app intervention reduced mental health symptoms, regardless of whether the agent included conversational or animation features, but animation features enhanced the user experience. These effects were observed in both users with and without depressive symptoms."

Therapeutic success in DBT requires that individuals generalize newly acquired skills to their natural environment. However, there have been only a limited number of options available to achieve this end. The primary goal of this research was to develop and test the feasibility of the DBT Coach, a software application for a smartphone, designed specifically to enhance generalization of a specific DBT skill (opposite action) among individuals with BPD-SUD. We conducted a quasiexperimental study in which 22 individuals who were enrolled in DBT treatment programs received a smartphone with the DBT Coach for 10 to 14 days and were instructed to use it as needed. Participants used the DBT Coach an average of nearly 15 times and gave high ratings of helpfulness and usability. Results indicate that both emotion intensity and urges to use substances significantly decreased within each coaching session. Furthermore, over the trial period, participants reported a decrease in depression and general distress. Mobile technology offering in vivo skills coaching may be a useful tool for reducing urges to use substances and engage in other maladaptive behavior by directly teaching and coaching in alternative, adaptive coping behavior."

Measurement-based peer supervision is one strategy to assure the quality of psychological treatments delivered by non-mental health specialist providers. In this formative study, we aimed to 1) describe the development and 2) examine the acceptability and feasibility of PEERS (Promoting Effective mental healthcare through peER Supervision)-a novel smartphone app that aims to facilitate registering and scheduling patients, collecting patient outcomes, rating therapy quality and assessing supervision quality-among frontline treatment providers delivering behavioral activation treatment for depression. The PEERS prototype was developed and tested in 2021, and version 1 was launched in 2022. To date, 215 treatment providers (98% female; ages 30-35) in Madhya Pradesh and Goa, India, have been trained to use PEERS and 65.58% have completed the supplemental, virtual PEERS course. Focus group discussions with 98 providers were examined according to four themes-training and education, app effectiveness, user experience and adherence and data privacy and safety. This yielded commonly endorsed facilitators (e.g., collaborative learning through group supervision, the convenience of consolidated patient data), barriers (e.g., difficulties with new technologies) and suggested changes (e.g., esthetic improvements, suicide risk assessment prompt). The PEERS app has the potential to scale measurement-based peer supervision to facilitate quality assurance of psychological treatments across contexts."

DESIGN: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomized, parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention. METHODS: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended patients with COVID-19 will be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. IMPACT: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.

While smartphones offer numerous benefits, excessive use can contribute to cognitive overload, emotional distress, and behavioral addiction. This review aims to explore the burden of PSU, its psychological and neurobiological mediating factors, and potential prevention and intervention strategies. METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Articles were selected based on their relevance to PSU and its associations with mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Both theoretical and empirical studies were included to provide a broad perspective on the topic. RESULTS: Findings indicate that PSU is associated with increased stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disruptions. The mechanisms underlying these associations include dopaminergic dysregulation, social comparison, Fear of Missing Out, cognitive overload, and poor sleep hygiene. Various interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, digital detox programs, and smartphone usage tracking applications, have been proposed to mitigate the negative impact of PSU. CONCLUSION: PSU is a significant risk factor for mental health disturbances, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Addressing PSU requires a multi-faceted approach involving behavioral interventions, public awareness initiatives, and policy regulations. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of existing interventions and to develop tailored strategies for reducing smartphone overuse and its psychological consequences."

METHOD: A total of 106 ED patients from eight different public and private mental health services in Spain were randomly assigned to two parallel groups. Patients of the experimental group (N = 53) received standard face-to-face CBT plus a mobile intervention through an application called ""TCApp,"" which provides self-monitoring and an online chat with the therapist. The control group (N = 53) received standard face-to-face CBT only. Patients completed self-report questionnaires on ED symptomatology, anxiety, depression, and quality of life, before and after treatment. RESULTS: Significant reductions in primary and secondary outcomes were observed for participants of both groups, with no differences between groups. Results also suggested that the frequency with which patients attended their referral mental health institution after the intervention was lower for patients in the experimental group than for those in the control group. DISCUSSION: The current study showed that CBT can help to reduce symptoms relating to ED, regardless of whether its delivery includes online components in addition to traditional face-to-face treatment. Besides, the additional component offered by the TCApp does not appear to be promising from a purely therapeutic perspective but perhaps as a cost-effective tool, reducing thus the costs and time burden associated with weekly visits to health professionals."

Internet-based interventions have shown to be one effective treatment modality; however, comorbidities are often not targeted. Transdiagnostic tailored internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) might be promising to overcome such issues. Aim: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, moderators, and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic tailored internet- and mobile-based guided intervention for depression and comorbid anxiety in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Two-hundred participants with MDD will be randomly assigned to an 8-week guided self-help internet intervention (IC) or a 6-month wait-list control group (WLC). Participants of the IC will receive weekly content-focused feedback on module completion as well as monitored adherence reminders from an eCoach. The primary outcome is clinician-rated depression severity (QIDS-C) at post-assessment assessed by diagnostic raters blind to study condition. Secondary outcomes include, e.g., change in diagnostic status (MDD and anxiety disorders), remission and response rates, disorder symptom severity, health related quality of life, incongruence related to needs and values, and behavioral activation. Assessments will take place at baseline (T1), post-assessment (T2), 6-month follow-up (T3), and 12-month follow-up in the IC. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. A large number of a priori defined moderators of treatment outcome will be assessed at baseline and tested in predicting treatment outcome. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from a societal perspective.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usability, acceptability, safety, and effectiveness of a new app, Clear Fear, developed to help young people manage symptoms of anxiety using the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. METHODS: The Clear Fear app was developed to provide cognitive behavioral strategies to suit anxiety disorders. An uncontrolled pre- and post-follow-up design over a 9-week period was used to assess the app and its effects. This study comprised 3 phases: baseline (stage 1), post-app familiarization phase (stage 2), and follow-up (stage 3). Eligible participants were aged between 16 and 25 years with mild to moderate anxiety but not currently receiving treatment or in contact with specialist mental health services or using other interventions or apps to help monitor or manage their mental health. A community sample was recruited via advertisements, relevant websites, and social media networks. Eligible participants completed standardized self-report tools and questionnaires at each study stage. These measured probable symptoms of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale) and depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire); emotional and behavioral difficulties (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire); and feedback on the usability, accessibility, and safety of the app. Mean scores at baseline and follow-up were compared using paired 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Qualitative data derived from open-ended questions were coded and entered into NVivo (version 10) for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 48 young people entered the study at baseline, with 37 (77%) completing all outcome measures at follow-up. The sample was mostly female (37/48, 77%). The mean age was 20.1 (SD 2.1) years. In total, 48% (23/48) of the participants reached the threshold for probable anxiety disorder, 56% (27/48) had positive scores for probable depression, and 75% (36/48) obtained a total score of ""very high"" on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for emotional and behavioral difficulties. The app was well received, offering reassurance, practical and immediate help to manage symptoms, and encouragement to seek help, and was generally found easy to use. A small minority (3/48, 6%) found the app difficult to navigate. The Clear Fear app resulted in statistically significant reductions in probable symptoms of anxiety (t36=2.6, 95% CI 0.41-3.53; P=.01) and depression (z=2.3; P=.02) and behavioral and emotional difficulties (t47=4.5, 95% CI 3.67-9.65; P<.001), representing mostly medium to large standardized effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The Clear Fear app was found to be usable, acceptable, safe, and effective in helping manage symptoms of anxiety and depression and emotional and behavioral difficulties."

OBJECTIVE: To test whether adding mobile application coaching and patient/provider web portals to community primary care compared with standard diabetes management would reduce glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cluster-randomized clinical trial, the Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study, randomly assigned 26 primary care practices to one of three stepped treatment groups or a control group (usual care). A total of 163 patients were enrolled and included in analysis. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin levels over a 1-year treatment period. Secondary outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, depression, and other clinical (blood pressure) and laboratory (lipid) values. Maximal treatment was a mobile- and web-based self-management patient coaching system and provider decision support. Patients received automated, real-time educational and behavioral messaging in response to individually analyzed blood glucose values, diabetes medications, and lifestyle behaviors communicated by mobile phone. Providers received quarterly reports summarizing patient's glycemic control, diabetes medication management, lifestyle behaviors, and evidence-based treatment options. RESULTS: The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were 1.9% in the maximal treatment group and 0.7% in the usual care group, a difference of 1.2% (P = 0.001) [corrected] over 12 months. Appreciable differences were not observed between groups for patient-reported diabetes distress, depression, diabetes symptoms, or blood pressure and lipid levels (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood glucose data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines to providers substantially reduced glycated hemoglobin levels over 1 year."
10.2196/36820,Video Game to Attenuate Pandemic-Related Stress From an Equity Lens: Development and Usability Study,"Minian N, Saiva A, Gayapersad A, Dragonetti R, Proulx C, Debergue P, Lecce J, Hussain S, Desjardins E, Selby P.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.4.12,,,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has introduced additional pressures on an already fragile mental health care system due to a significant rise in depression, anxiety, and stress among Canadians. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment to reduce such mental health issues, few people have access to CBT in an engaging and sustainable manner. To address this gap, a collaboration between the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) developed CBT-based self-led, online, clinician-tested modules in the form of a video game, named Legend of Evelys, and evaluated its usability in the attenuation of a COVID-19-related increase in stress. OBJECTIVE: We here present the conceptualization and design of new self-care modules in the form of a video game, its implementation in a technological infrastructure, and inclusivity and privacy considerations that informed the development. A usability study of the modules was performed to assess the video game's usability, user engagement, and user perceptions. METHODS: The development of the video game involved establishment of a technology infrastructure for secure implementation of the software for the modules and a clinician-led assessment of the clinical utility of these modules through two ""whiteboard"" sessions. The usability study was informed by a mixed methods sequential explanatory design to evaluate the intervention of the mobile app through two distinct phases: quantitative data collection using in-app analytics data and two surveys, followed by qualitative data collection by semistructured interviews. RESULTS: A total of 32 participants trialed the app for 2 weeks. They used the video game an average of six times and rated the game as ""good"" based on the Systems Usability Scale score. In terms of stress reduction, the study demonstrated a significant difference in the participants' Perceived Stress Scale score at baseline (mean 22.14, SD 6.187) compared with that at the 2-week follow-up (mean 18.04, SD 6.083; t27=3.628, P=.001). Qualitative interviews helped participants identify numerous functionality issues and provided specific recommendations, most of which were successfully integrated into the video game for future release. CONCLUSIONS: Through this collaboration, we have established that it is possible to incorporate CBT exercises into a video game and have these exercises adopted to address stress. While video games are a promising strategy to help people with their stress and anxiety, there is a further need to examine the real-world effectiveness of the Legend of Evelys in reducing anxiety."

Short skills-focused self-guided interventions (SGIs) on smartphones are a scalable way to improve stress-coping skills at the population level. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to examine the possible efficacy of a recently developed stress-coping SGI (Intellect) in improving psychological distress, relative to an active control group and 2 potential moderators of this predicted relationship (ie, psychological mindedness [PM] and coping self-efficacy [CSE]). METHODS: University students (N=321) were randomly assigned to either an 8-day SGI on stress-coping or an active control group. Self-reported measures were obtained at baseline, after the intervention, and at the 1-month follow-up. The primary outcome was psychological stress (Psychological Stress Measure-9). Secondary outcomes were anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). PM and CSE were assessed as potential moderators at baseline. RESULTS: The final sample (n=264) included 188 (71.2%) female, 66 (25%) male, 7 (2.7%) nonbinary, and 3 (1.1%) others participants with a mean age of 22.5 (SD 5.41) years. The intervention group reported significantly lower perceived stress (partial eta-squared [ηp2]=0.018; P=.03) and anxiety (ηp2=0.019; P=.03) levels after intervention relative to the active control group. The effects on perceived stress levels remained statistically significant at the 1-month follow-up (ηp2=0.015; P=.05). Students with the lowest CSE and highest PM experienced the fastest decline in perceived stress levels (β=6.37, 95% Cl 2.98-9.75). Improvements in anxiety levels were not observed at 1-month follow-up. Similarly, no intervention effects were found for depression levels at postintervention and follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the Intellect stress-coping SGI is effective in reducing perceived stress and anxiety levels among university students. Mobile health apps are brief, scalable, and can make important contributions to public mental health.

Users may frequently and flexibly access bite-size CBT content on personal devices, review and practice skills, and thereby achieve better outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We explored the distribution of actual interactions participants had with therapeutic content in a trial of smartphone CBT for depression and whether interactions were within assigned treatment modules or revisits to prior module content (ie, between-module interactions). METHODS: We examined the association between the number of within- and between-module interactions and baseline and end-of-treatment symptom severity during an 8-week, single-arm open trial of a therapist-guided CBT for depression mobile health app. RESULTS: Interactions were more frequent early in treatment and modestly declined in later stages. Within modules, most participants consistently made more interactions than required to progress to the next module and tended to return to all types of content rather than focus on 1 skill. By contrast, only 15 of 26 participants ever revisited prior module content (median number of revisits=1, mode=0, IQR 0-4). More revisits were associated with more severe end-of-treatment symptom severity after controlling for pretreatment symptom severity (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the frequency of use is an insufficient metric of engagement, lacking the nuance of what users are engaging with and when during treatment. This lens is essential for developing personalized recommendations and yielding better treatment outcomes.

This study analyzed qualitative responses that were paired with a mood rating (1-9 scale) from daily ecological momentary assessments via text-messaging of 52 low-income, Spanish-speaking patients to assess the relationship between word use and changes in mood during group CBT. Based on previous research, we chose 11 linguistic dimensions from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis software that conceptually related to core CBT treatment elements and sociocultural factors of depression in Latinxs. Results showed that the use of words from the categories of Friends, Religion, Positive Emotions, and Leisure (proxy for behavioral activation) were significantly associated with a significant increase in mood. The use of Negative Emotions and Health words were significantly associated with a significant decrease in mood. Post-hoc analysis revealed that Certainty (proxy for cognitive inflexibility) words were related to a significant decrease in mood when Negative Emotional words were present. Findings contribute to our understanding of the role of sociocultural factors and core CBT elements in changes in mood among Latinxs. Lastly, this paper demonstrates the potential for analyzing language content during a digital health intervention to better understand user experiences."

Scalable conversational agents (CAs) have the potential to deliver behavior interventions at a low threshold. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of behavioral interventions delivered by CAs for the treatment of headaches. OBJECTIVE: This study has 2 aims. The first aim was to develop and test a smartphone-based coaching intervention (BalanceUP) for people experiencing frequent headaches, delivered by a CA and designed to improve mental well-being using various behavior change techniques. The second aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of BalanceUP by comparing the intervention and waitlist control groups and assess the engagement and acceptance of participants using BalanceUP. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, adults with frequent headaches were recruited on the web and in collaboration with experts and allocated to either a CA intervention (BalanceUP) or a control condition. The effects of the treatment on changes in the primary outcome of the study, that is, mental well-being (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale), and secondary outcomes (eg, psychosomatic symptoms, stress, headache-related self-efficacy, intention to change behavior, presenteeism and absenteeism, and pain coping) were analyzed using linear mixed models and Cohen d. Primary and secondary outcomes were self-assessed before and after the intervention, and acceptance was assessed after the intervention. Engagement was measured during the intervention using self-reports and usage data. RESULTS: A total of 198 participants (mean age 38.7, SD 12.14 y; n=172, 86.9% women) participated in the study (intervention group: n=110; waitlist control group: n=88). After the intervention, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed evidence for improved well-being (treatment: β estimate=-3.28, 95% CI -5.07 to -1.48) with moderate between-group effects (Cohen d=-0.66, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.33) in favor of the intervention group. We also found evidence of reduced somatic symptoms, perceived stress, and absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as improved headache management self-efficacy, application of behavior change techniques, and pain coping skills, with effects ranging from medium to large (Cohen d=0.43-1.05). Overall, 64.8% (118/182) of the participants used coaching as intended by engaging throughout the coaching and completing the outro. CONCLUSIONS: BalanceUP was well accepted, and the results suggest that coaching delivered by a CA can be effective in reducing the burden of people who experience headaches by improving their well-being.

10.2196/36910,Delivery of a Mental Health Intervention for Chronic Pain Through an Artificial Intelligence-Enabled App (Wysa): Protocol for a Prospective Pilot Study,"Gupta M, Malik T, Sinha C.",JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022.3.22,,,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain often experience coexisting, long-term and debilitating mental health comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Artificial intelligence-supported cognitive behavioral therapy (AI-CBT) interventions could offer cost-effective, accessible, and potentially effective resources to address this problem. However, there is not enough research conducted about the efficacy of AI-CBT interventions for chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study aims to examine the efficacy and use of an AI-CBT intervention for chronic pain (Wysa for Chronic Pain app, Wysa Inc) using a conversational agent (with no human intervention). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study for chronic pain using a fully-automated, free-text-based conversational agent. METHODS: Participants with self-reported chronic pain (n=500) will be recruited online on a rolling basis from April 2022 through posts on US-based internet communities within this prospective cohort. Informed consent is received from participants within the app, and the Wysa for Chronic Pain intervention is delivered remotely for 8 weeks. Outcome measures including a numeric pain rating scale and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Pain Interference, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 questionnaires administered to test the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing levels of pain interference, depression, and anxiety. The therapeutic alliance created with the conversational agent will be assessed through the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised instrument. Retention and use statistics will be observed for adherence and engagement. RESULTS: The study will open for recruitment in April 2022, and data collection is expected to be completed by August 2022. The results for the primary outcomes are expected to be published by late 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health conversational agents driven by artificial intelligence could be effective in helping patients with chronic pain learn to self-manage their pain and common comorbidities like depression and anxiety. The Wysa for Chronic Pain app is one such digital intervention that can potentially serve as a solution to the problems of affordability and scalability associated with interventions that include a human therapist. This prospective study examines the efficacy of the app as a treatment solution for chronic pain. It aims to inform future practices and digital mental health interventions for individuals with chronic pain. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/36910."
10.2196/jmir.1838,Harnessing context sensing to develop a mobile intervention for depression,"Burns MN, Begale M, Duffecy J, Gergle D, Karr CJ, Giangrande E, Mohr DC.",J Med Internet Res,2011,2011.8.16,,,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing. METHODS: We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients' mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients' self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (beta(week) = -.81, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (b(week) = -.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (beta(week) = -.71, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58). CONCLUSIONS: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed.

We developed TODAY!, a culturally informed mobile phone intervention for young men who are attracted to men and who have clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression. The core of the intervention consists of daily psychoeducation informed by transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and a set of tools to facilitate putting these concepts into action, with regular mood ratings that result in tailored feedback (eg, tips for current distress and visualizations of mood by context). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct usability testing to understand how young sexual minority men interact with the app, to inform later stages of intervention development. METHODS: Participants (n=9) were young sexual minority men aged 18-20 years (Mean=19.00, standard deviation [SD]=0.71; 44% black, 44% white, and 11.1% Latino), who endorsed at least mild depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants were recruited via flyers, emails to college lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations, Web-based advertisements, another researcher's database of sexual minority youth interested in research participation, and word of mouth. During recorded interviews, participants were asked to think out loud while interacting with the TODAY! app on a mobile phone or with paper prototypes. Feedback identified from these recordings and from associated field notes were subjected to thematic analysis using a general inductive approach. To aid interpretation of results, methods and results are reported according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ). RESULTS: Thematic analysis of usability feedback revealed a theme of general positive feedback, as well as six recurring themes that informed continued development: (1) functionality (eg, highlight new material when available), (2) personalization (eg, more tailored feedback), (3) presentation (eg, keep content brief), (4) aesthetics (eg, use brighter colors), (5) LGBT or youth content (eg, add content about coming out), and (6) barriers to use (eg, perceiving psychoeducation as homework). CONCLUSIONS: Feedback from usability testing was vital to understanding what young sexual minority men desire from a mobile phone intervention for symptoms of anxiety and depression and was used to inform the ongoing development of such an intervention."

This study evaluates the feasibility of a mobile health (mHealth) application designed to support cognitive-behavioral therapy for FM by enabling real-time tracking of patient-reported outcomes and adaptive treatment modifications within public health care settings. Thirty-six adults with FM participated in this feasibility study, which assessed the app's usability, acceptability, and clinical utility for both patients and therapists. Results demonstrated high usability ratings (87.63 for patients, 88.75 for therapists) and adherence rates (67.9 percent of requested evaluations completed), confirming the app's practicality and engagement potential. The app generated 1,348 clinical alarms during the intervention, providing actionable insights that allowed therapists to tailor treatments dynamically. This study highlights the role of mHealth technologies in enhancing psychological care through data-driven, real-time monitoring, and treatment personalization. Small but notable reductions in depression levels underscore the app's potential to improve psychological outcomes. By fostering engagement and facilitating personalized care, this approach advances the integration of digital health tools in chronic disease management, offering a scalable model for enhancing behavioral interventions in public health systems."

The PRODIGITAL-D pragmatic, single-blind, two-arm, individually randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a mobile messaging psychosocial intervention in improving depressive symptomatology among older adults in socioeconomically deprived areas of Guarulhos, Brazil. Older adults (aged 60+ years) registered with 24 primary care clinics and identified with depressive symptomatology (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores ≥ 10) received the 6-week Viva Vida intervention based on psychoeducation and behavioral activation (n = 298) or a single message (n = 305). No health professional support was offered. The primary outcome was improvement from depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9 < 10) at 3 months. Of the 603 participants enrolled (mean age = 65.1 years; 451 (74.8%) women), 527 (87.4%) completed the follow-up assessment. In the intervention arm, 109 of 257 (42.4%) participants had an improved depressive symptomatology, compared with 87 of 270 (32.2%) participants in the control arm (adjusted odds ratio = 1.57; 95% confidence interval = 1.07-2.29; P = 0.019). No severe adverse events related to trial participation were observed.

However, older adults have difficulty accessing them. Interventions administered through online video games may increase their accessibility, and complementing these with a smartphone app will likely increase adherence and allow for ongoing professional monitoring. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention for active aging administered through an online interactive multimedia video game that includes a smartphone app companion. The secondary objectives are to analyze the moderators and mediators of the change in the outcome variables and to evaluate the adherence to the intervention. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Adults 45 years and older will be randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral intervention administered through an online multimedia video game that includes a smartphone app companion or to a control group that will receive online information on active aging (274 participants per group). The intervention will be administered in eight weekly 45-min modules. An investigator-blinded evaluation will be conducted using online self-administered tests at baseline, post-intervention, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome will be mental health status as evaluated using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes will be emotional well-being, depressive symptoms, reinforcement, negative thoughts, self-reported memory, cognitive task performance, sleep hygiene behaviors, physical activity, eating habits, body mass index, social support, dropout, treatment adherence, and satisfaction with the intervention.

However, most current tools fail to meet evidence-based principles. In this paper, we describe data-driven design implications for translating evidence-based interventions into mobile apps. To develop these design implications, we analyzed data from a month-long field study of an app designed to support dialectical behavioral therapy, a psychotherapy that aims to teach concrete coping skills to help people better manage their mental health. We investigated whether particular skills are more or less effective in reducing distress or emotional intensity. We also characterized how an individual's disorders, characteristics, and preferences may correlate with skill effectiveness, as well as how skill-level improvements correlate with study-wide changes in depressive symptoms. We then developed a model to predict skill effectiveness. Based on our findings, we present design implications that emphasize the importance of considering different environmental, emotional, and personal contexts. Finally, we discuss promising future opportunities for mobile apps to better support evidence-based psychotherapies, including using machine learning algorithms to develop personalized and context-aware skill recommendations."

The patient registers their activity hourly, and together with the therapist, they agree on a plan to change behavior. However, with the limited clinical personnel, and a growing patient population, new methods are needed to advance behavioral activation. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper were to (1) automatically identify behavioral patterns through statistical analysis of the paper-based activity diaries, and (2) determine whether it is feasible to move the behavioral activation therapy format to a digital solution. METHODS: We collected activity diaries from seven patients with bipolar depression, covering in total 2,480 hours of self-reported activities. A pleasure score, on a 1-10 rating scale, was reported for each activity. The activities were digitalized into 6 activity categories, and statistical analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Across all patients, movement-related activities were associated with the highest pleasure score followed by social activities. On an individual level, through a nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, one patient had a statistically significant larger amount of spare time activities when feeling bad (z=-2.045, P=.041). Through a within-subject analysis of covariance, the patients were found to have a better day than the previous, if that previous day followed their diurnal rhythm (ρ=.265, P=.029). Furthermore, a second-order trend indicated that two hours of daily social activity was optimal for the patients (β2=-0.08, t (63)=-1.22, P=.23). CONCLUSIONS: The data-driven statistical approach was able to find patterns within the behavioral traits that could assist the therapist in as well as help design future technologies for behavioral activation."

Digital health interventions offer a promising solution to overcome barriers associated with traditional treatment methods, providing accessible, scalable, and cost-effective means to support individuals in reducing hazardous drinking. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Sober smartphone app in individuals with hazardous alcohol use. METHODS: This single-group, pre- and postpilot study included 20 participants with risky alcohol use, identified using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Participants used the Sober app for 4 weeks, incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions. Feasibility was assessed by study and session completion rates, acceptability by participant satisfaction and perceived usefulness, and preliminary efficacy by changes in alcohol consumption and psychiatric symptoms. Semistructured interviews with participants and clinicians provided qualitative perspectives on the app's usability, efficacy, and areas for improvement. RESULTS: Of the 20 enrolled participants, 17 completed the study. The app demonstrated high feasibility with an 85% (17/20) study completion rate, and 59% (10/17) completed all cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. Participants reported positive acceptability, with average satisfaction and usefulness ratings of 3.8 and 3.7 of 5, respectively. Preliminary efficacy outcomes showed significant improvements: abstinence days increased from 67% to 85% (z=-3.17; P=.002), heavy drinking episodes decreased from 3.3 to 1.9 (t16=-2.97; P=.003), and total alcohol consumption reduced from 456.8 to 195.9 mL (t16=3.16; P=.002). Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores dropped from 17.5 to 10.7 (t16=4.51; P<.001). Additionally, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) scores decreased from 5.8 to 4.4 (t16=2.91; P=.01), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) scores from 3.4 to 2.1 (z=-2.80; P=.005). No adverse events were reported. Qualitative analysis found participants valued daily logging but noted usability issues, while clinicians called for tailored goals, enhanced communication features, and age-specific content. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile app Sober shows promise as an effective tool for reducing hazardous alcohol consumption and improving related psychiatric symptoms. The study demonstrated high feasibility and positive acceptability, with significant preliminary efficacy in reducing alcohol use. Qualitative findings provided actionable evidence for refining the app's usability and clinical integration. Further research through a randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm these findings and optimize the app's features and content."

Cognitive-behavioural therapies, both face-to-face and online, have demonstrated efficacy in treating post-loss mental health problems. Mobile phone applications potentially offer an efficient and cost-effective way to deliver self-help to bereaved adults, yet controlled effectiveness studies are lacking. Therefore, we examined the short-term efficacy of the My Grief app, based on cognitive-behavioural therapy, in 248 bereaved parents, in a randomised controlled trial (Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT04552717). Participants were randomly allocated to access to the My Grief app (n = 126) or a waitlist (n = 122). At baseline and post-assessment, symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression, negative grief cognitions, rumination, and avoidance were assessed. Reductions in prolonged grief and posttraumatic stress symptoms and negative cognitions in the intervention group were larger than in the control group, albeit with small effect sizes. Fifteen app users reported negative experiences with the app; for example, some mentioned that it elicited painful memories and emotions related to their loss. My Grief appears to achieve modest improvements in mental health in bereaved parents. Given that it is accessible and low-cost, it is an important addition to the suite of prolonged grief interventions."

If not successfully treated at this age, they often persist into adulthood, exerting a great social and economic toll. Given the long-term impact, finding ways to increase the success and cost-effectiveness of mental health care is a pressing need. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for mood and anxiety disorders throughout the lifespan. Mental health technologies can be used to make such treatments more successful by delivering them in a format that increases utilization. Young people embrace technologies, and many want to actively manage their mental health. Mobile software apps have the potential to improve youth adherence to CBT and, in turn, improve outcomes of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to improve homework adherence in CBT for youth anxiety and/or depression. The objectives are to (1) design and optimize the usability of a mobile app for delivering the homework component of CBT for youth with anxiety and/or depression, (2) assess the app's impact on homework completion, and (3) implement the app in CBT programs. We hypothesize that homework adherence will be greater in the app group than in the no-app group. METHODS: Phase 1: exploratory interviews will be conducted with adolescents and therapists familiar with CBT to obtain views and perspectives on the requirements and features of a usable app and the challenges involved in implementation. The information obtained will guide the design of a prototype. The prototype will be optimized via think-aloud procedures involving an iterative process of evaluation, modification, and re-evaluation, culminating in a fully functional version of the prototype that is ready for optimization in a clinical context. Phase 2: a usability study will be conducted to optimize the prototype in the context of treatment at clinics that provide CBT treatment for youth with anxiety and/or depression. This phase will result in a usable app that is ready to be tested for its effectiveness in increasing homework adherence. Phase 3: a pragmatic clinical trial will be conducted at several clinics to evaluate the impact of the app on homework adherence. Participants in the app group are expected to show greater homework completion than those in the no-app group. RESULTS: Phase 3 will be completed by September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The app will be a unique adjunct to treatment for adolescents in CBT, focusing on both anxiety and depression, developed in partnership with end users at every stage from design to implementation, customizable for different cognitive profiles, and designed with depression symptom tracking measures for youth made interoperable with electronic medical records."

It is estimated that 30-50% of university students meet criteria for some mental disorder, especially depression, in any given year. The university has traditionally provided many channels to promote students' mental health, but until now only a minority have sought such help, possibly owing to lack of time and/or to stigma related to mental illness. Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) shows promise for its accessibility and effectiveness. However, its most effective components and for whom it is more (or less) effective are not known. METHODS/DESIGN: Based on the multiphase optimization strategy framework, this study is a parallel-group, multicenter, open, fully factorial trial examining five smartphone-delivered CBT components (self-monitoring, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, assertion training, and problem solving) among university students with elevated distress, defined as scoring 5 or more on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The primary outcome is change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to week 8. We will estimate specific efficacy of the five components and their interactions through the mixed-effects repeated-measures analysis and propose the most effective and efficacious combinations of components. Effect modification by selected baseline characteristics will be examined in exploratory analyses. DISCUSSION: The highly efficient experimental design will allow identification of the most effective components and the most efficient combinations thereof among the five components of smartphone CBT for university students. Pragmatically, the findings will help make the most efficacious CBT package accessible to a large number of distressed university students at reduced cost; theoretically, they will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of CBT and help further advance CBT for depression.

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a tool to improve access to mental health services. However, iCBT remains underdeveloped in Chinese communities, particularly in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally and linguistically appropriate guided iCBT program for Hong Kong Chinese with depressive symptoms, and (2) explore their treatment adherence. METHODS: An 11-week guided iCBT program, ""Confront and Navigate Depression Online"" (CANDO), consisting of 8 online modules, was developed and implemented for Hong Kong residents. The program was accessible via either an online platform (web-based iCBT) or a smartphone app (app-based iCBT). A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted, with participants recruited through open recruitment and referrals from 2 local non-governmental organizations. A total of 402 eligible participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms were randomly allocated into 3 groups: (1) web-based iCBT (n=139); (2) app-based iCBT (n=131); and (3) waitlist control (WLC) group (n=132), who transitioned to the web-based iCBT group after waiting for 11 weeks. Therapist support was provided by a clinical psychologist through 3 counseling sessions and weekly assignment feedback. The primary outcomes were the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the secondary outcome measures included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Chinese Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (CATQ), and the Chinese Affect Scale (CAS). These scales were administered at preintervention, postintervention, and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessments. Data analysis was conducted using linear mixed effects modeling, adhering to the intent-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Participants in both the web- and app-based iCBT groups reported significant improvements compared with the WLC group on all primary (P<.001) and secondary measures (P<.001 and P=.009) at posttreatment. Large between-group effect sizes were observed in the reduction of depressive symptoms, with Cohen's d value of 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.34) for the web-based group and 1.15 (95% CI 0.88-1.43) for the app-based group on the BDI-II. Additionally, the web- and app-based groups showed effect sizes of 0.78 (95% CI 0.52-1.04) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.63-1.27) on PHQ-9, respectively. Medium to large effect sizes were observed for secondary outcomes at posttreatment. These positive effects were maintained at both the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, with medium to large within-group effect sizes. The adherence rate in the 2 iCBT groups was 154 out of 270 (57.0%) for completing all 8 online modules and 152 out of 270 (56.3%) for attending all 4 counseling sessions (including an intake interview). The recovery rate, as measured by the BDI-II at posttreatment, was 35 out of 90 (39%) for the web-based group and 36 out of 91 (40%) for the app-based group, compared with 3 out of 112 (3%) in the WLC group. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally and linguistically adapted iCBT is an effective and feasible treatment for Hong Kong Chinese with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, demonstrating a satisfactory recovery rate and treatment adherence. ICBT offers an accessible and viable alternative to face-to-face interventions in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government should allocate more resources and support the use of iCBT as a tool to treat people with depressive symptoms.

10.2196/23655,A Mobile Health Intervention (LifeBuoy App) to Help Young People Manage Suicidal Thoughts: Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Randomized Controlled Trial,"Han J, McGillivray L, Wong QJ, Werner-Seidler A, Wong I, Calear A, Christensen H, Torok M.",JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020.10.27,,,"BACKGROUND: Self-help smartphone apps offer a new opportunity to address youth suicide prevention by improving access to support and by providing potentially high fidelity and cost-effective treatment. However, there have been very few smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this population. To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys. RESULTS: The trial recruitment started in May 2020. Data collection is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal thoughts. This trial will extend knowledge about the efficacy and acceptability of app-based support for suicidal thoughts in young people.

This pilot study explores a digital intervention targeting mental health, brain health, and immune functioning in individuals aged 55-60 with subjective cognitive decline, elevated stress and depressive symptoms. Seventeen participants engaged in a two-week intervention comprising spatial cognition, psychological techniques based on mindfulness, attention-training exercises, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Pre-and post-intervention changes in resting-state functional connectivity, inflammation, and psychological health were evaluated. Key findings include: (1) Reduced self-reported depression with a large effect size, (2) Decreased connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), (3) Enhanced anticorrelation between the DMN-Salience networks that was associated with improved depression scores (4) Reduced salivary IL-18 concentration with a medium effect size, correlated with decreased DMN-amygdala connectivity. There was a trend towards reduced anxiety, with no significant changes in quality of life. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of digital intervention on immune markers, clinical behavioral outcomes, and brain function, demonstrating positive synergistic potential across all three levels. These preliminary findings, which need replication in larger, controlled studies, have important implications for basic science and scalable digital interventions."
10.1186/s13063-019-3176-z,A self-guided Internet-based intervention for individuals with gambling problems: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Bücker L, Westermann S, Kühn S, Moritz S.",Trials,2019,2019.1.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Only a small fraction of individuals with pathological or problematic gambling seek professional help despite available evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Anonymous Internet-based interventions may help to overcome treatment barriers. Results of a pilot study using an Internet-based intervention for depression in a sample of individuals with problematic or pathological gambling behavior show that both depressive and gambling-related symptomatology can be reduced with a generic depression program compared with a wait-list control group. Based on encouraging results of the pilot study, we developed a low-threshold, anonymous and cost-free online self-help program (""Restart"") to test whether a program tailored to the needs of gamblers yields better results compared to the effects of the intervention evaluated in the pilot study. The online self-help program is based on CBT, targeting emotional problems and gambling-related symptoms and is accompanied by a smartphone application to sustain treatment benefits. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial with two conditions (intervention group and wait-list control group), two assessment times (reassessment after 8 weeks) and a total of 136 participants is planned. The primary outcome will be change in pathological gambling measured with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale from pre to post intervention. The change in depressive symptoms (assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 depression module) and gambling-related dysfunctional thoughts (assessed with the Gambling Attitudes and Beliefs Survey) will represent secondary outcomes. The intervention includes modules on debt management, impulse control, gambling-specific cognitive biases, self-esteem, social competence, sleep hygiene, mindfulness and positive activities. DISCUSSION: This study is one of the first investigations of Internet-based self-help programs in a sample of problematic gamblers. Self-guided Internet-based interventions represent a promising possibility to narrow the existing treatment gap while saving expensive and scarce resources (e.g., psychotherapists). The expected findings will add substantial knowledge in the development of effective Internet-based treatments for individuals with gambling problems. The empirical and clinical implications (e.g., broader use and promotion of such interventions in the future) and the limitations of the study will be discussed.

Lifestyle interventions via mobile apps and conversational agents present themselves as low-cost, scalable solutions to prevent these conditions. This paper describes the rationale for, and development of, ""LvL UP 1.0″, a smartphone-based lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary team led the intervention design process of LvL UP 1.0, involving four phases: (i) preliminary research (stakeholder consultations, systematic market reviews), (ii) selecting intervention components and developing the conceptual model, (iii) whiteboarding and prototype design, and (iv) testing and refinement. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy and the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions were used to guide the intervention development. RESULTS: Preliminary research highlighted the importance of targeting holistic wellbeing (i.e., both physical and mental health). Accordingly, the first version of LvL UP features a scalable, smartphone-based, and conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention built around three pillars: Move More (physical activity), Eat Well (nutrition and healthy eating), and Stress Less (emotional regulation and wellbeing). Intervention components include health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily ""Life Hacks"" (healthy activity suggestions), breathing exercises, and journaling. In addition to the intervention components, formative research also stressed the need to introduce engagement-specific components to maximise uptake and long-term use. LvL UP includes a motivational interviewing and storytelling approach to deliver the coaching sessions, as well as progress feedback and gamification. Offline materials are also offered to allow users access to essential intervention content without needing a mobile device. CONCLUSIONS: The development process of LvL UP 1.0 led to an evidence-based and user-informed smartphone-based intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. LvL UP is designed to be a scalable, engaging, prevention-oriented, holistic intervention for adults at risk of NCDs and CMDs. A feasibility study, and subsequent optimisation and randomised-controlled trials are planned to further refine the intervention and establish effectiveness. The development process described here may prove helpful to other intervention developers."
10.2196/35671,Understanding People With Chronic Pain Who Use a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Artificial Intelligence Mental Health App (Wysa): Mixed Methods Retrospective Observational Study,"Meheli S, Sinha C, Kadaba M.",JMIR Hum Factors,2022,2022.3.22,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions can bridge barriers in access to treatment among individuals with chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the perceived needs, engagement, and effectiveness of the mental health app Wysa with regard to mental health outcomes among real-world users who reported chronic pain and engaged with the app for support. METHODS: Real-world data from users (N=2194) who reported chronic pain and associated health conditions in their conversations with the mental health app were examined using a mixed methods retrospective observational study. An inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the conversational data of users with chronic pain to assess perceived needs, along with comparative macro-analyses of conversational flows to capture engagement within the app. Additionally, the scores from a subset of users who completed a set of pre-post assessment questionnaires, namely Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (n=69) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) (n=57), were examined to evaluate the effectiveness of Wysa in providing support for mental health concerns among those managing chronic pain. RESULTS: The themes emerging from the conversations of users with chronic pain included health concerns, socioeconomic concerns, and pain management concerns. Findings from the quantitative analysis indicated that users with chronic pain showed significantly greater app engagement (P<.001) than users without chronic pain, with a large effect size (Vargha and Delaney A=0.76-0.80). Furthermore, users with pre-post assessments during the study period were found to have significant improvements in group means for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 symptom scores, with a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.60-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that users look for tools that can help them address their concerns related to mental health, pain management, and sleep issues. The study findings also indicate the breadth of the needs of users with chronic pain and the lack of support structures, and suggest that Wysa can provide effective support to bridge the gap."

Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer a promising way to deliver accessible cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions. However, research on the usability and effectiveness of apps explicitly tailored for adolescents is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the usability, engagement, and perceived effectiveness of a mobile CBT app designed for adolescents, focusing on user experiences and mental health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with 40 adolescents aged 13-19 years (mean age 15.8, SD 1.9 years; 18/40, 45% male; 22/40, 55% female) who engaged with a CBT app for 4 weeks. Mental health diagnoses included anxiety (20/40, 50%), depression (15/40, 38%), and both (5/40, 13%). Of these, 10 (25%) of the 40 participants had previous CBT experience. Feedback was gathered through focus groups and individual interviews, and thematic analysis identified key themes related to usability, engagement, and perceived effectiveness. Quantitative data on mood and anxiety scores were analyzed with paired t tests. RESULTS: The mean usability score was 3.8 (SD 0.6), and the mean effectiveness score was 3.9 (SD 0.7). Older participants (aged 16-19 years) reported significantly higher usability (mean 4.1, SD 0.4) and effectiveness scores (mean 4.3, SD 0.5) compared to younger participants (aged 13-15 years) (P=.03). Females had higher usability (mean 4, SD 0.6) and effectiveness scores (mean 4.2, SD 0.7) than males (mean 3.6, SD 0.7, and mean 3.5, SD 0.8, respectively; P=.03). Participants with prior CBT experience had 2.8 times higher odds of reporting high usability scores (95% CI 1.6-5; P=.002) and 3.1 times higher odds of reporting high effectiveness scores (95% CI 1.7-5.6; P=.001). Usability challenges included complex navigation (20/40, 50%), interface design issues (12/40, 30%), and content overload (8/40, 20%). Factors positively influencing engagement were motivation driven by personal relevance (20/40, 50%) and gamification features (10/40, 25%), while lack of personalization (14/40, 35%) and external distractions (18/40, 45%) were significant barriers. Mood improvement (15/40, 38%) and learning new coping skills (12/40, 30%) were the most reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile CBT app shows potential for improving adolescent mental health, with initial improvements in mood and anxiety. Future app iterations should prioritize simplifying navigation, adding personalization features, and enhancing technical stability to support long-term engagement."
10.1186/s13012-018-0756-3,Leveraging routine clinical materials and mobile technology to assess CBT fidelity: the Innovative Methods to Assess Psychotherapy Practices (imAPP) study,"Wiltsey Stirman S, Marques L, Creed TA, Gutner CA, DeRubeis R, Barnett PG, Kuhn E, Suvak M, Owen J, Vogt D, Jo B, Schoenwald S, Johnson C, Mallard K, Beristianos M, La Bash H.",Implement Sci,2018,2018.5.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Identifying scalable strategies for assessing fidelity is a key challenge in implementation science. However, for psychosocial interventions, the existing, reliable ways to test treatment fidelity quality are often labor intensive, and less burdensome strategies may not reflect actual clinical practice. Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) provide clinicians with a set of effective core elements to help treat a multitude of disorders, which, evidence suggests, need to be delivered with fidelity to maximize potential client impact. The current ""gold standard"" for rating CBTs is rating recordings of therapy sessions, which is extremely time-consuming and requires a substantial amount of initial training. Although CBTs can vary based on the target disorder, one common element employed in most CBTs is the use of worksheets to identify specific behaviors and thoughts that affect a client's ability to recover. The present study will develop and evaluate an innovative new approach to rate CBT fidelity, by developing a universal CBT scoring system based on worksheets completed in therapy sessions. METHODS: To develop a scoring system for CBT worksheets, we will compile common CBT elements from a variety of CBT worksheets for a range of psychiatric disorders and create adherence and competence measures. We will collect archival worksheets from past studies to test the scoring system and assess test-retest reliability. To evaluate whether CBT worksheet scoring accurately reflects clinician fidelity, we will recruit clinicians who are engaged in a CBT for depression, anxiety, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder. Clinicians and clients will transmit routine therapy materials produced in session (e.g., worksheets, clinical notes, session recordings) to the study team after each session. We will compare observer-rated fidelity, clinical notes, and fidelity-rated worksheets to identify the most effective and efficient method to assess clinician fidelity. Clients will also be randomly assigned to either complete the CBT worksheets on paper forms or on a mobile application (app) to learn if worksheet format influences clinician and client experience or differs in terms of reflecting fidelity. DISCUSSION: Scoring fidelity using CBT worksheets may allow clinics to test fidelity in a short and effective manner, enhancing continuous quality improvement in the workplace. Clinicians and clinics can use such data to improve clinician fidelity in real time, leading to improved patient outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03479398 .

10.1111/jsr.14409,Effectiveness and safety of an interactive internet-based intervention to improve insomnia: Results from a randomised controlled trial,"Specht A, Betz LT, Riepenhausen A, Jauch-Chara K, Jacob GA, Riemann D, Göder R.",J Sleep Res,2024,2024.12.15,,,"Many adults suffer from insomnia. Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia is the recommended treatment option, but access to it is not readily available. Digital interventions have the potential to close the treatment gap by offering scalable and cost-efficient options. The present randomised controlled trial aimed at investigating the effectiveness and safety of somnovia, an interactive internet-based intervention for patients with insomnia. A total of 290 participants with chronic insomnia were randomised to intervention (n = 149) or the control (n = 141) condition. Participants of the intervention group received access to somnovia for 6 months in addition to treatment as usual, whereas participants in the control group only had access to treatment as usual for the time of the study. Online questionnaires were filled in before randomisation and after 3 and 6 months. The primary endpoint was the Insomnia Severity Index, with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale as secondary endpoints. After 3 months, the intervention group showed lower insomnia (Cohen's d = 0.71, CI = [0.44, 0.98]), depressive (Cohen's d = 0.66, CI = [0.41, 0.90]), and anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.56, CI = [0.32, 0.81]) symptoms, as well as improved overall functioning (Cohen's d = 0.50, CI = [0.24, 0.76]) compared with participants in the control group. The effects stayed stable after 6 months. The results indicate that next to a therapeutic effect on insomnia symptoms, somnovia might potentially help to prevent the onset of other psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety."

This study examined the feasibility, efficacy, and acceptability of Lenio, an Internet-based self-help intervention, combined with the COGITO smartphone application for managing these conditions. The randomized controlled trial involved an intervention group (IG) using Lenio and COGITO, an active control group (ACG) using a transdiagnostic app, and a wait-list control group (WCG) receiving usual treatment. Lenio incorporates cognitive behavioral therapy and third-wave techniques, supported by COGITO's gamified daily exercises to enhance adherence. Across 263 participants assessed at three intervals over 16 weeks, the IG showed significant improvement in somatic-affective depressive symptoms compared to the WCG post-intervention and both control groups at follow-up. However, the ACG outperformed the IG in managing pain at post-intervention though these effects did not persist until follow-up. The interventions were well-received and feasible, with older participants benefiting more from the Lenio/COGITO combination. Lenio and COGITO could bridge gaps to conventional therapy, potentially easing pain by enhancing psychological well-being and coping strategies.

10.2196/21432,Usage and Weekly Attrition in a Smartphone-Based Health Behavior Intervention for Adolescents: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Egilsson E, Bjarnason R, Njardvik U.",JMIR Form Res,2021,2021.1.22,,,"BACKGROUND: The majority of adolescents own smartphones, although only 8% of them use health apps. Attrition rates from adolescent mobile health (mHealth) interventions for treating mental health problems such as anxiety and depression are an issue with a high degree of variation. Attrition in mHealth interventions targeting adolescent populations is frequently presented in a two-point fashion, from initiation of the intervention to the end of treatment, lacking more time-specific information on usage and times of attrition. Self-efficacy could provide an avenue to lower attrition rates, although a better understanding of the relationship between mental health factors and time-specific attrition rates is needed. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to obtain time-specific attrition rates among adolescents in an mHealth intervention, and to describe the intervention's usage and feasibility in relation to adolescent self-efficacy levels, and emotional and physical health. METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled public school pilot trial was undertaken with 41 adolescents. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks, while in-app activity and attrition rates were continually assessed throughout the intervention period. The primary outcome was attrition based on time and type of in-app health behavior usage, and feasibility of the mHealth app. Secondary outcome measures were self-efficacy levels, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as standardized BMI and sleep. Analyses of group mean variances with adjusted α levels through Bonferroni corrections were used to assess main outcome effects. RESULTS: The attrition from initiation of the intervention to 6-week follow up was 35%. Attrition started in the third week of the intervention and was related to daily time of app usage (Rt=0.43, P<.001). The number of average weekly in-app health exercises completed decreased significantly from the first week of the intervention (mean 55.25, SD 10.96) to the next week (mean 13.63, SD 2.94). However, usage increased by 22% between week 2 and the last week of the intervention (mean 16.69, SD 8.37). Usability measures revealed satisfactory scores (mean 78.09, SD 9.82) without gender differences (P=.85). Self-reported daily physical activity increased by 19.61% in the intervention group but dropped by 26.21% among controls. Self-efficacy levels increased by 8.23% in the invention arm compared to a 3.03% decrease in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usability of an mHealth intervention among adolescent participants. Indications were toward beneficial effects on physical and mental health that warrant further research. Focus on time-specific attrition measures alongside daily times of usage and ways to increase participants' self-efficacy levels appear to be a promising avenue for research on mHealth interventions for adolescent populations with the aim to ultimately lower attrition rates."

Cross-sectional or retrospective studies cannot capture the dynamic course and possible predictors of suicidal ideation as it occurs in daily life. This study utilizes an experience sampling paradigm to identify real-time predictors of suicidal ideation in inpatients with major depressive disorder. Thirty-one depressed patients admitted to a psychiatric unit were signaled by a mobile device to record suicidal ideation, affect, and other symptoms, multiple times a day over 1 week. Participants completed a total of 1350 questionnaires. Seventy-four percent of the sample reported suicidal ideation during the week. Time-lagged analyses revealed that momentary ratings of Sadness, Tension, and Boredom (as well as suicidal ideation itself) predicted subsequent suicidal thoughts in the following hours. Baseline severity of depression and past suicide attempts were both correlated with mean ideation severity during the week. A number of predictors identified in prior research (e.g. hopelessness) were unrelated to subsequent suicidal ideation in the current study. Momentary interventions that guide individuals through activities designed to reduce levels of Sadness, Tension, and Boredom in real-time (e.g., thought challenging, relaxation, behavioral activation) may be especially warranted."

As a novelty, it incorporates ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which can provide psychological support in real time, when suffering arises. The main goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CUIDA-TE to improve emotion regulation in healthcare workers, a population that has been particularly emotionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) the study sample will be composed of a minimum of 174 healthcare workers. They will be randomly assigned to a 2-month EMI group (CUIDA-TE APP, n ≥ 58), a 2-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) only group (MONITOR EMOCIONAL APP, n ≥ 58), or a wait-list control group (no daily monitoring nor intervention, n ≥ 58). CUIDA-TE will provide EMI if EMA reveals emotional problems, poor sleep quality/quantity, burnout, stress, or low perceived self-efficacy when regulating emotions. Depression will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include emotion regulation, quality of life, and resilience. Treatment acceptance and usability will also be measured. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at the 3-month follow-up for all groups. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that evaluates the efficacy of an APP-based EMI to improve emotion regulation skills in healthcare workers. This type of intervention might ultimately help disseminate treatments and reach a larger number of individuals than traditional face-to-face individual therapies.

10.2196/38067,Assessing the Impact of Conversational Artificial Intelligence in the Treatment of Stress and Anxiety in Aging Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Danieli M, Ciulli T, Mousavi SM, Silvestri G, Barbato S, Di Natale L, Riccardi G.",JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022.9.23,,,"BACKGROUND: While mental health applications are increasingly becoming available for large populations of users, there is a lack of controlled trials on the impacts of such applications. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered agents have been evaluated when assisting adults with cognitive impairments; however, few applications are available for aging adults who are still actively working. These adults often have high stress levels related to changes in their work places, and related symptoms eventually affect their quality of life. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of TEO (Therapy Empowerment Opportunity), a mobile personal health care agent with conversational AI. TEO promotes mental health and well-being by engaging patients in conversations to recollect the details of events that increased their anxiety and by providing therapeutic exercises and suggestions. METHODS: The study was based on a protocolized intervention for stress and anxiety management. Participants with stress symptoms and mild-to-moderate anxiety received an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered remotely. A group of participants also interacted with the agent TEO. The participants were active workers aged over 55 years. The experimental groups were as follows: group 1, traditional therapy; group 2, traditional therapy and mobile health (mHealth) agent; group 3, mHealth agent; and group 4, no treatment (assigned to a waiting list). Symptoms related to stress (anxiety, physical disease, and depression) were assessed prior to treatment (T1), at the end (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3), using standardized psychological questionnaires. Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and General Anxiety Disorders-7 scales were administered before the intervention (T1), at mid-term (T2), at the end of the intervention (T3), and after 3 months (T4). At the end of the intervention, participants in groups 1, 2, and 3 filled in a satisfaction questionnaire. RESULTS: Despite randomization, statistically significant differences between groups were present at T1. Group 4 showed lower levels of anxiety and depression compared with group 1, and lower levels of stress compared with group 2. Comparisons between groups at T2 and T3 did not show significant differences in outcomes. Analyses conducted within groups showed significant differences between times in group 2, with greater improvements in the levels of stress and scores related to overall well-being. A general worsening trend between T2 and T3 was detected in all groups, with a significant increase in stress levels in group 2. Group 2 reported higher levels of perceived usefulness and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences could be observed between participants who used the mHealth app alone or within the traditional CBT setting. However, the results indicated significant differences within the groups that received treatment and a stable tendency toward improvement, which was limited to individual perceptions of stress-related symptoms.

These adults need evidence-based and scalable interventions. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of Moodivate, a self-directed digital intervention for mental health, in treating depression symptoms among patients in the primary care setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-group decentralized randomized clinical trial recruited participants from September 22, 2021, to December 27, 2023, and completed data collection on March 29, 2024. Adult patients with at least moderate symptoms of depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (score ≥10) were enrolled from 22 primary care clinics in South Carolina. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received Moodivate (a digital behavioral activation intervention), Moodivate with health care provider access to information on patient use of the digital behavioral activation intervention in the electronic health record (EHR), or usual care for depression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change in depression symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included a clinically significant improvement in depression symptoms on the BDI-II (10-point decrease in score), depression remission on the BDI-II (score ≤13), digital behavioral activation intervention engagement, and primary care provider (a physician or other health care professional who is responsible for a patient's primary care) use of the EHR features. RESULTS: Among 649 participants, 495 (76%) were female and the mean (SD) age was 44.68 (15.22) years. Participants who received the digital behavioral activation intervention, with and without EHR integration, had significantly improved depression symptoms vs those who received usual care over 12 weeks (least squares mean change from baseline for Moodivate: -10.34; SE = 0.82; d = 0.98; Moodivate with EHR: -9.88; SE = 0.81; d = 0.93; usual care: -5.94; SE = -0.80; d = 0.54). Participants in the Moodivate groups had 2.5 to 3.0 times higher odds of having a clinically significant improvement in depression symptoms (Moodivate: OR, 2.98 [97.5% CI, 1.69-5.27]; P < .001; Moodivate with EHR: OR, 2.53 [97.5% CI, 1.45-4.41]; P < .001) and 2.3 to 2.6 times higher odds of experiencing depression remission (Moodivate: OR, 2.27 [97.5% CI, 1.16-4.44; P = .006; Moodivate with EHR: OR, 2.63 [97.5% CI, 1.38-5.04]; P < .001) than participants who received usual care. Participant engagement with Moodivate was high in the first month (68% to 100% weekly retention), and 33% of patients continued to use the digital behavioral activation intervention after 12 weeks. Fourteen percent of primary care providers who received access used the EHR functionality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that a digital behavioral activation intervention is effective for treating adults with at least moderate symptoms of depression in the primary care setting.

10.2196/mental.8984,Standalone Effects of a Cognitive Behavioral Intervention Using a Mobile Phone App on Psychological Distress and Alcohol Consumption Among Japanese Workers: Pilot Nonrandomized Controlled Trial,"Hamamura T, Suganuma S, Ueda M, Mearns J, Shimoyama H.",JMIR Ment Health,2018,2018.3.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Research that investigates standalone effects of a mobile phone-based cognitive behavioral therapy without any human contact for reducing both psychological distress and risky drinking has been advancing; however, the number of studies is still limited. A mobile phone app called Self Record that facilitates cognitive restructuring through self-monitoring of daily thoughts and activities was developed in Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study conducted a nonrandomized controlled pilot trial of the Self Record app to investigate standalone effects of the intervention on psychological distress and alcohol consumption among Japanese workers. Additionally, we examined moderating effects of negative mood regulation expectancies, which are beliefs about one's ability to control one's negative mood. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design with a 1-month follow-up was conducted online in Japan from February 2016 to March 2016. A research marketing company recruited participants. The selection criteria were being a Japanese full-time worker (age 20-59 years), experiencing mild to moderate psychological distress, and having some interest in self-record apps. Assignment to group was based on participants' willingness to use the app in the study. All participants completed outcome measures of negative mood regulation expectancies, positive well-being, general distress, depression, anxiety, and typical/most weekly alcohol consumption. RESULTS: From the recruitment, 15.65% (1083/6921) of participants met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 51.43% (557/1083) enrolled in the study: 54.9% (306/557) in the intervention group and 45.1% (251/557) in the control group. At the 1-month follow-up, 15.3% (85/557) of participants had dropped out. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that participants in the intervention group reported increased typical drinking (η2=.009) and heavy drinking (η2=.001). Adherence to using the app was low; 64.8% (199/306) of participants in the intervention group discontinued using the app on the first day. Additionally, 65.7% (366/557) of the total sample did not correctly answer the validity checks in the outcome measures (eg, ""Please select 'mildly agree' for this item""). Therefore, per-protocol analyses were conducted after removing these participants. Results showed that continuing app users (42/127) in the intervention group reported increases in anxiety (η2=.006), typical drinking (η2=.005), and heavy drinking (η2=.007) compared to those in the control group (85/127). Negative mood regulation expectancies moderated the effects of the intervention for general distress (beta=.39). CONCLUSIONS: Results were contrary to our hypotheses. Self-recording methods of standalone mobile phone interventions may heighten individuals' awareness of their pathological thought and drinking behavior, but may be insufficient to decrease them unless combined with a more intense or face-to-face intervention. Limitations include high attrition in this study; measures to improve the response rate are discussed."

This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a novel DTx, CT-152 (Rejoyn™), for MDD adjunctive to antidepressant medication monotherapy. METHODS: Adults aged 22-64 years with MDD having an inadequate response to current antidepressant medication monotherapy were enrolled in a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, remote trial with a 6-week intervention and 4-week extension. Delivered via smartphone apps, the CT-152 group received a cognitive-emotional and behavioral therapeutic intervention; the control group received a sham app with a working memory task. Both groups received supportive text messages and continued current antidepressant medication. The primary outcome was Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score change from baseline to week 6. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 386 participants were randomly assigned (CT-152, n = 194; sham, n = 192). In the primary efficacy analysis of participants with ≥1 treatment session and ≥ 1 MADRS assessment post-baseline (n = 354), MADRS score changed -9.03 in the CT-152 group and - 7.25 in the sham (difference - 1.78, P = 0.0568). These results were consistent with data from additional patient and clinician scales. In a supportive analysis of the intent-to-treat sample (n = 386), the between-group difference in 6-week MADRS change from baseline was -2.12 (P = 0.0211), favoring CT-152. No TEAEs or discontinuations were considered related to CT-152, and no deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: CT-152 resulted in depression symptom improvement and a favorable safety profile. Based on these data, CT-152 became the first FDA-authorized prescription DTx for the adjunctive treatment of MDD."
10.1016/j.invent.2025.100815,"Influence of patient satisfaction, system usability, and working alliance on depressive symptom improvement in blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT): Secondary analysis of an open trial data","Atik E, Hornstein S, Reinking E, Schückes M.",Internet Interv,2025,2025.3.6,,,"Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT), which involves the use of a digital application to support face-to-face psychotherapy, is increasingly offered to patients with depression amid a growing body of research on its efficacy. However, there is still limited understanding of the factors that influence the efficacy of this novel treatment method. To investigate the effects of potential factors such as patient satisfaction with the received treatment, patients' self-rated working alliance with their therapist, and patients' rating of system usability of the digital application, this secondary analysis study focused on a sample of 66 university students who completed an effective 6-week bCBT program that included weekly sessions with a therapist and access to a digital mental health application. We examined whether those three potential factors predict patients' improvement in depressive symptoms in a bCBT treatment. Patient satisfaction and working alliance are known predictors of treatment success in standard psychotherapy, yet their importance in blended treatment is largely unstudied. System usability is a factor that is frequently addressed while describing digital treatment programs, yet its contribution to the success of treatments has been mostly omitted. All the variables analyzed displayed a significant positive correlation with improvement in depressive symptoms. When taken together, all the factors account for 16.6 % of the variance in the outcome. However, when three variables were added in the backward multiple linear regression with stepwise elimination, only patient satisfaction emerged as a predictor of the outcome. Although there are significant correlations between working alliance and system usability and the improvement of depression in the bCBT program, their lack of predictive power in comparison to patient satisfaction renders the results inconclusive. Future studies could explore the potential contribution of additional variables to the improvement of depressive symptoms."

Unfortunately, most antenatal care systems do not provide any structured screening for maternal mental health. As a consequence, mental illnesses are often overlooked and not treated adequately. If correctly diagnosed, cognitive behavioral therapy is currently the treatment of choice for mental illnesses. In addition, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) seem to represent a promising treatment option for anxiety and depression during the peripartum period. Considering the internet's increasing omnipresence, MBIs can also be offered electronically via a (tablet) computer or smartphone (electronically based MBI = eMBI). OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an eMBI (the mindmom application) developed by an interdisciplinary team of gynecologists, psychologists, and midwives, teaching pregnant women how to deal with stress, pregnancy-related anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The study sample consists of pregnant women in their third trimester who screened positive for emotional distress. The mindmom study is a bicentric prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is currently conducted at the University women's hospitals of Heidelberg and Tübingen, Germany. METHODS: Within the scope of the routine prenatal care, pregnant women attending routine pregnancy care in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, are invited to participate in a screening for mental distress based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Women with an EPDS screening result > 9 will be referred to one of the mindmom coordinating study centers and are offered counseling either face-to-face or via videotelephony. After an initial psychological counseling, women are invited to participate in an eMBI in their last pregnancy trimester. The study will enroll N = 280 study participants (N = 140 per group), who are randomized 1:1 into the intervention (IG) or control group (treatment as usual = TAU). All participants are requested to complete a total of 7 digital assessments (5 visits pre- and 2 follow-up visits postpartum), involving self-report questionnaires, sociodemographic and medical data, physiological measures, and morning cortisol profiles. The primary outcome will be depressive and anxiety symptoms, measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State Trait Anxiety Questionnaire, and the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include mindfulness, satisfaction with birth, quality of life, fetal attachment, bonding, mode of delivery, and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: This is the first German RCT to examine the (cost-)effectiveness of an eMBI on maternal mental health during pregnancy. If successful, the mindmom app represents a low-threshold and cost-effective help for psychologically distressed women during pregnancy, thereby reducing the negative impact on perinatal health outcome.

Less than half of patients suffering from depression can achieve remission after adequate antidepressant treatment. Another promising treatment option is cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). However, the need for experienced therapists and substantive dedicated time prevent CBT from being widely disseminated. In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the same time, in comparison to switching antidepressants only, among patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted since September 2014. The smartphone-based CBT program, named the ""Kokoro-App,"" for major depression has been developed and its feasibility has been confirmed in a previous open study. The program consists of an introduction, 6 sessions and an epilogue, and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks by patients. In the present trial, 164 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder and still suffering from depressive symptoms after adequate antidepressant treatment for more than 4 weeks will be allocated to the Kokoro-App plus switching antidepressant group or the switching antidepressant alone group. The participants allocated to the latter group will receive full components of the Kokoro-App after 9 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire through the 9 weeks of the program, as assessed at week 0, 1, 5 and 9 via telephone by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes include the change in the total score of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, change in side effects as assessed by the Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating, and treatment satisfaction. DISCUSSION: An effective and reachable intervention may not only lead to healthier mental status among depressed patients, but also to reduced social burden from this illness. This paper outlines the background and methods of a trial that evaluates the possible additive value of a smartphone-based CBT program for treatment-resistant depression.

It was reported that approximately 14 million people were affected by earthquakes in Turkey in February 2023. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a therapeutic approach to treating PTSD and has a proven efficacy. However, access to face-to-face therapies such as CBT is limited and there is a high dropout rate. Technology-based interventions can offer new solutions to make CBT more accessible and integrated into daily life. In this study, we will develop an application called TraumaRelief, which aims to relieve PTSD symptoms. We will test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of this application through a pilot randomized controlled study conducted in Turkey, with 105 participants aged between 18 and 65 years who have experienced a traumatic event. Participants will be randomly assigned to the Application Plus Online Therapist Support Group (AT + OT Group), Application Only Group (Group A), and Waitlist Control Group (WLC Group). This study aims to evaluate symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, as well as their effects on quality of life. In addition, the feasibility and acceptability of the study; the attrition, consent, recruitment, and adherence rate to the application; fidelity of intervention delivery; system usability score; preferred and least preferred module components; app utilization frequency; and likelihood to recommend the application will be examined. Application efficacy will be monitored with follow-ups at one and three months. The results could provide important information on the integration of technology-based treatments with psychotherapy. In addition, it could allow the evaluation of potential mobile applications in the field of psychotherapy and represents an important step in the development and evaluation of a customized mobile application for a society with unique cultural and social dynamics, such as Turkey.

A 5-step development approach was employed, consisting of: blueprinting, scripting, video production and digital content creation, uploading digital content to a Learning Management System and user testing. This resulted in the development of two courses, one called Foundational Skills covering the skills to become an effective counselor, and the second called Behavioral Activation covering the skills for addressing adult depression. Twenty-one participants with a range of health-related backgrounds, including 11 with prior training in mental healthcare, completed the training and joined focus group discussions offering qualitative feedback and recommendations for improving the program's usability. Participant feedback centered around the need to make the content more interactive, to include additional engaging features, and to improve the layout and usability of the platform.

To help women with endometriosis after their diagnosis, we developed a digital program combining user research, evidence-based medicine, and clinical expertise. Structured around cognitive behavioral therapy and the quality of life metrics from the Endometriosis Health Profile score, the program was designed to guide participants for 3 months. OBJECTIVE: This cohort study was designed to measure the impact of a digital health program on the symptoms and quality of life levels of women with endometriosis. METHODS: In total, 63% (92/146) of the participants were included in the pilot study, recruited either free of charge through employer health insurance or via individual direct access. A control group of 404 women with endometriosis who did not follow the program, recruited through social media and mailing campaigns, was sampled (n=149, 36.9%) according to initial pain levels to ensure a similar pain profile to participants. Questionnaires assessing quality of life and symptom levels were emailed to both groups at baseline and 3 months. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were used to analyze intragroup and intergroup differences, with Cohen d measuring effect sizes for significant results. RESULTS: Over 3 months, participants showed substantial improvements in global symptom burden, general pain level, anxiety, depression, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, chronic fatigue, neuropathic pain, and endo belly. These improvements were significantly different from the control group for global symptom burden (participants: mean -0.7, SD 1.6; controls: mean -0.3, SD 1.3; P=.048; small effect size), anxiety (participants: mean -1.1, SD 2.8; controls: mean 0.2, SD 2.5; P<.001; medium effect size), depression (participants: mean -0.9, SD 2.5; controls: mean 0.0, SD 3.1; P=.04; small effect size), neuropathic pain (participants: mean -1.0, SD 2.7; controls: mean -0.1, SD 2.6; P=.004; small effect size), and endo belly (participants: mean -0.9, SD 2.5; controls: mean -0.3, SD 2.4; P=.03; small effect size). Participants' quality of life improved between baseline and 3 months and significantly differed from that of the control group for the core part of the Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (participants: mean -5.9, SD 21.0; controls: mean 1.0, SD 14.8; P=.03; small effect size) and the EQ-5D (participants: mean 0.1, SD 0.1; controls: mean -0.0, SD 0.1; P=.001; medium effect size). Perceived knowledge of endometriosis was significantly greater at 3 months among participants compared to the control group (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study's results suggest that a digital health program providing medical and scientific information about endometriosis and multidisciplinary self-management tools may be useful to reduce global symptom burden, anxiety, depression, neuropathic pain, and endo belly while improving knowledge on endometriosis and quality of life among participants."

This paper introduces an 8-week treatment protocol to realize that vision-Technology Enabled Clinical Care (TECC). TECC offers innovation in clinical assessment, monitoring, and interventions for mental health. TECC uses the mindLAMP app to enable digital phenotyping, clinical communication, and smartphone-based exercises that will augment in-person or telehealth virtual visits. TECC exposes participants to an array of evidence-based treatments (cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy) introduced through clinical sessions and then practiced through interactive activities provided through a smartphone app called mindLAMP. OBJECTIVE: TECC will test the feasibility of providing technology-enabled mental health care within an outpatient clinic; explore the practicality for providing this care to individuals with limited English proficiency; and track anxiety, depression, and mood symptoms for participants to measure the effectiveness of the TECC design. METHODS: The TECC study will assess the acceptability and efficacy of this care model in 50 participants as compared to an age- and gender-matched cohort of patients presenting with similar clinical severity of depression, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms. Participants will be recruited from clinics in the Metro Boston area. Aspects of TECC will be conducted in both Spanish and English to ensure wide access to care for multiple populations. RESULTS: The results of the TECC study will be used to support or adapt this model of care and create training resources to ensure its dissemination. The study results will be posted on ClinicalTrials.gov, with primary outcomes related to changes in mood, anxiety, and stress, and secondary outcomes related to engagement, alliance, and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: TECC combines new digital mental health technology with updated clinical protocols and workflows designed to ensure patients can benefit from innovation in digital mental health. Supporting multiple languages, TECC is designed to ensure digital health equity and highlights how mobile health can bridge, not expand, gaps in care for underserved populations.

Such difficulties are known to substantially impact quality of life and overall functioning. Yet, there is a lack of treatment interventions specifically designed to address these challenges. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development and assess the feasibility, along with the initial clinical outcomes, of a novel blended intervention for adults with ADHD. The blended intervention combines both face-to-face and digital components and is specifically designed to address emotion dysregulation in ADHD. METHODS: This intervention was an 8-week blended intervention combining weekly face-to-face group sessions with a supplementary digital companion app. The intervention is based on elements from dialectic behavioral therapy skills training and positive psychology. To evaluate its feasibility, we performed a 10-week feasibility study with an uncontrolled pre-post study design, including 16 adults with ADHD and co-occurring emotion dysregulation. The feasibility measures encompassed adherence, satisfaction, and perceived credibility of the intervention. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by self-reported symptoms of emotion dysregulation, inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, executive function, depression, anxiety, and a measure of quality of life. Paired sample 2-tailed t tests were used to analyze clinical outcomes with a Bonferroni-corrected significance level. RESULTS: Both treatment credibility and treatment satisfaction were rated favorably by the majority of the participants. In particular, the participants emphasized meeting others with ADHD as beneficial. In terms of adherence, 3 participants withdrew before initiating the intervention, while another 4 participants did not complete the intervention. On average, the participants who enrolled in the intervention attended 6.2 of the 8 group sessions and completed 6.7 of the 8 skills training modules in the companion app. In terms of clinical outcomes, there was a reduction in symptoms of emotion dysregulation from before to after the intervention (d=2.0). Significant improvements were also observed in measures of inattention (d=1.1) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (d=0.9). However, no significant improvements were found in the domains of depression, anxiety, quality of life, and executive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The results are encouraging, both in terms of feasibility and the preliminary clinical results on emotion dysregulation. The blended format, combining digital and face-to-face elements, may also seem to offer some advantages: the group-based format was valued as it facilitated peer interaction, while a rather high completion of modules in the companion app highlights its potential to enhance skills training between the group sessions. Future randomized controlled trials are called for to further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the intervention.

This pilot study aimed to explore the effectiveness and safety of a novel bCBT application for treating unipolar depression in adults combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to CBT alone in routine care. METHODS: Patients (N = 82) were randomly assigned to bCBT (n = 42) or CBT (n = 40) over 12 weeks. bCBT consisted of weekly CBT sessions accompanied by the elona therapy depression module (a bCBT application for unipolar depression) for use between sessions. Standard CBT consisted of weekly CBT sessions. Outcomes (6,12 weeks) were analyzed with linear mixed models. RESULTS: Improvements in depressive symptoms (BDI-II, PHQ-9) were descriptively larger for the bCBT group. Yet, this difference did not reach statistical significance. bCBT was superior to standard CBT in secondary outcome measures of psychological health (d = .50) and generalized anxiety symptoms (d = -.45). In other secondary outcomes (BAI, PSWQ, GSE, WHOQOL-BREF), improvements were descriptively larger for bCBT compared to CBT. CONCLUSION: This pilot study provided preliminary evidence that bCBT might be advantageous in comparison to CBT alone in the treatment of depression, but larger RCTs of the bCBT application are needed."

Despite the adverse effects of depression, fewer than one-third of patients receive care. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (i-CBT) is an effective treatment for depression, and combining i-CBT with supervised care could make the therapy scalable and effective. A stepped care model is a framework for beginning treatment with an effective and low-intensity intervention while adapting care based on the patient's needs. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of a stepped care i-CBT model for depression based on changes in self-reported depressive symptoms. METHODS: In this single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, participants were allocated to either the i-CBT-only group (28/56, 50%) or the i-CBT with stepped care group (28/56, 50%). Both groups received a 13-week i-CBT program tailored for depression. The i-CBT program was provided through a secure, online mental health clinic called the Online Psychotherapy Tool. Participants read through the sessions and completed the assignments related to each session. Participants in the stepped care group received additional interventions from their care provider based on standard questionnaire scores (ie, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology [QIDS], and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form) and their assignment responses. From lowest to highest intensity, the additional interventions included SMS text messages, phone calls, video calls, or a video call with a psychiatrist. RESULTS: For this study, 56 participants were recruited to complete an i-CBT program (n=28, 50%; mean age 37.9; SD 13.08 y; 7/28, 27% were men) or an i-CBT with stepped care program (n=28, 50%; mean age 40.6; SD 14.28 y; 11/28, 42% were men). The results of this study indicate that the i-CBT program was effective in significantly reducing depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9 (F4,80=9.95; P<.001) and QIDS (F2,28=5.73; P=.008); however, there were no significant differences in the reduction of depressive symptoms between the 2 groups (PHQ-9: F4,80=0.43; P=.78; QIDS: F2,28=3.05; P=.06). The stepped care group was not significantly better in reducing depressive symptoms than the i-CBT group (PHQ-9, P=.79; QIDS, P=.06). Although there were no significant differences observed between the number of participants who completed the program between the groups (χ21=2.6; P=.10), participants in the stepped care group, on average, participated in more sessions than those who prematurely terminated participation in the i-CBT group (t55=-2; P=.03; 95% CI -4.83 to -0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a stepped care approach in i-CBT is an effective treatment for depression, and the stepped care model can assist patients to complete more sessions in their treatment.

By adolescence, 20% of youth with SCD develop chronic SCD pain. Our randomized controlled trial found significant reductions in pain in youth receiving digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) vs education control. However, little is known about factors that moderate the effects of CBT in adolescents with SCD. This secondary data analysis aims to identify adolescent and family characteristics that moderate treatment effects on pain outcomes in 111 adolescents aged 12 to 18 with SCD (M = 14.9, SD = 1.9, girls = 59%) and their caregivers. Adolescents were randomly assigned to digital CBT (N = 57) or education control (N = 54). Digital CBT included separate content for parents/caregivers (ie, a website to learn problem-solving skills and behavioral and communication strategies) and youths (ie, a smartphone app and website to learn pain management skills). Outcomes were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment (2 months), and follow-up (6 months). Potential moderators included pretreatment variables (ie, adolescent variables: age, executive functioning, anxiety, depression; parent variables: psychological distress, protective behaviors, family functioning). There was a significant overall effect modification on pain intensity outcomes from pretreatment parent psychological distress (P = 0.012), where CBT appeared more effective among those with elevated parental distress. Differential intervention effects were observed across multiple potential moderator groups, though most of these differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study underscores the importance of family factors in understanding the efficacy of digital CBT for adolescent SCD pain, pointing to the need for future research to optimize CBT through targeted family-focused strategies."

AIM: To assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) in cases of depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample for the study comprised 52 diagnosed cases of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria in the age range of 21 to 50 years. They were randomized with the help of the app and assigned to CBT and IPT groups. Two patients had dropped out of the CBT group. Hence, finally, 50 cases were taken for study. A total of 12 therapy sessions were given. All patients were given standard treatment as prescribed. RESULTS: Findings of paired samples t-test to assess the within-group differences in both the groups (CBT and IPT) as well as gains score statistics or difference score statistics (pre-test minus post-test) were applied to compare group differences. Results of paired samples 't' test suggest that there was a statistically significant difference in the scores of both the groups from pre-test to post-test. IPT group had shown significantly better outcomes as quantified by the percentage of patients scoring less on the outcome variable of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hopelessness Scale, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). CONCLUSION: Both CBT and IPT are efficacious in the treatment of MDD. IPT yielded better results on MADRS as compared to CBT on parameters of outcome in the present study. The findings indicate that interventions were effective in reducing the symptoms of depression."

Despite advances in treatment, there has been limited progress in addressing the burden at a population level. Accordingly, there has been growing interest in prevention approaches as an additional pathway to address depression. Depression can be prevented using evidence-based psychological programmes. However, barriers to implementing and accessing these programmes remain, typically reflecting a requirement for delivery by clinical experts and high associated delivery costs. Digital technologies, specifically smartphones, are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to mental health programmes. The Future Proofing Study is a large-scale school-based trial investigating whether cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) delivered by smartphone application can prevent depression. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial targeting up to 10,000 Year 8 Australian secondary school students will be conducted. In Stage I, schools will be randomised at the cluster level either to receive the CBT intervention app (SPARX) or to a non-active control group comparator. The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes include psychological distress, anxiety and insomnia. At the 12-month follow-up, participants in the intervention arm with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in an individual-level randomised controlled trial (Stage II) and be randomised to receive a second CBT app which targets sleep difficulties (Sleep Ninja) or a control condition. Assessments will occur post intervention (both trial stages) and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post baseline. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes in symptoms from baseline to follow-up relative to the control group using mixed-effect models. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial testing the effectiveness of smartphone apps delivered to school students to prevent depression at scale. Results from this trial will provide much-needed insight into the feasibility of this approach. They stand to inform policy and commission decisions concerning if and how such programmes should be deployed in school-based settings in Australia and beyond.

It can weaken the immune system, affect cardiovascular health, and lower quality of life, often leading to psychological disorders like anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth stress management interventions on psychological health parameters, specifically anxiety, depression, stress, and quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across several databases, including the Cochrane Library, APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and clinical trial registers. Randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of eHealth stress management interventions, namely internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), telephone-delivered CBT, internet-based stress management training, or telephone-delivered stress management training, on the specified psychological outcomes in patients with CVD were included. The control group comprised no intervention, a waitlist, (enhanced) usual care, or a web-based intervention not focusing on stress management. To evaluate potential bias, the Risk-of-Bias 2 tool was applied. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using standard mean difference (SMD) as the effect size, with a sensitivity analysis using mean difference (MD). RESULTS: A total of 6 randomized controlled studies were considered in the meta-analysis. In 5 studies internet-based CBT interventions were examined, while one study used an eHealth intervention based on a CBT approach. The control groups received either usual care, were placed on a waitlist, or participated in a web-based discussion forum. After the intervention period, which ranged from 8 weeks to 6 months, a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.46, MD=-2.33; P<.001), as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, was observed in the intervention group compared with the control group. Mental health-related quality of life, assessed by the subscale of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, showed significant improvement (SMD=0.38, MD=3.89; P<.001) in the intervention group in comparison to the control group following the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrates that eHealth stress management interventions substantially improve psychological health parameters in patients with CVD. Given the significant positive impact, health care providers should consider integrating eHealth stress management programs into standard care for patients with CVD. These programs can be a valuable tool in mitigating the psychological burdens associated with chronic cardiovascular conditions, ultimately improving overall patient outcomes and quality of life."

10.2196/11572,Exploring the Use of Multiple Mental Health Apps Within a Platform: Secondary Analysis of the IntelliCare Field Trial,"Kwasny MJ, Schueller SM, Lattie E, Gray EL, Mohr DC.",JMIR Ment Health,2019,2019.3.22,,,"BACKGROUND: IntelliCare is a mental health app platform with 14 apps that are elemental, simple and brief to use, and eclectic. Although a variety of apps may improve engagement, leading to better outcomes, they may require navigation aids such as recommender systems that can quickly direct a person to a useful app. OBJECTIVE: As the first step toward developing navigation and recommender tools, this study explored app-use patterns across the IntelliCare platform and their relationship with depression and anxiety outcomes. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the IntelliCare Field Trial, which recruited people with depression or anxiety. Participants of the trial received 8 weeks of coaching, primarily by text, and weekly random recommendations for apps. App-use metrics included frequency and lifetime use. Depression and anxiety, measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively, were assessed at baseline and end of treatment. Cluster analysis was utilized to determine patterns of app use; ordinal logistic regression models and log-rank tests were used to determine if these use metrics alone, or in combination, predicted improvement or remission in depression or anxiety. RESULTS: The analysis included 96 people who generally followed recommendations to download and try new apps each week. Apps were clustered into 5 groups: Thinking (apps that targeted or relied on thinking), Calming (relaxation and insomnia), Checklists (apps that used checklists), Activity (behavioral activation and activity), and Other. Both overall frequency of use and lifetime use predicted response for depression and anxiety. The Thinking, Calming, and Checklist clusters were associated with improvement in depression and anxiety, and the Activity cluster was associated with improvement in Anxiety only. However, the use of clusters was less strongly associated with improvement than individual app use. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the field trial remained engaged with a suite of apps for the full 8 weeks of the trial. App-use patterns did fall into clusters, suggesting that some knowledge about the use of one app may be useful in selecting another app that the person is more likely to use and may help suggest apps based on baseline symptomology and personal preference."

Increasing access to effective treatment for depression is a major societal challenge. In this context, the increasing use of computers in the form of laptops or smartphones has made it feasible to increase access to mental healthcare through digital technology. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a 14-week therapist-guided Internet-delivered program for patients with major depression undergoing routine care. From 2015 to 2018, 105 patients were included in the study. For depressive symptoms, we identified significant within-group effect sizes (post-treatment: d = 0.96; 6-month follow-up: d = 1.21). We also found significant effects on secondary anxiety and insomnia symptoms (d = 0.55-0.92). Clinically reliable improvement was reported by 48% of those undergoing the main parts of the treatment, whereas 5% of the participants reported a clinically significant deterioration. However, a large proportion of patients showed no clinically reliable change. In summary, the study identified large treatment effects, but also highlighted room for improvement in the usability of the treatment."

Given the limited access to psychosocial treatments for PwE, digital interventions could bridge treatment gaps and help improve QoL. The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of emyna, a fully automated digital intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, in improving health-related QoL among PwE who reported impairments in QoL. A previous trial showed that emyna was effective in improving depressive symptoms among PwE with a comorbid depressive disorder, but its effects on QoL among PwE without comorbid depression remain unknown. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted with N = 438 PwE (mean age = 37.5, 70.3% women, physician-verified diagnoses) who were assigned to the intervention group (n = 216), which used emyna alongside treatment as usual (TAU), or the control group (n = 222), which received TAU only. QoL and secondary outcomes such as general self-efficacy, medication adherence, general distress, and epilepsy-related work and social adjustment were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was QoL assessed with the Quality of Life in Epilepsy [QOLIE-31] total score at 3 months post-randomization. RESULTS: Findings from the intent-to-treat analyses showed that after 3 months, participants in the intervention group experienced significant and clinically relevant improvements in health-related QoL compared to the control group (baseline-adjusted group difference = 4.5; 95% CI = [2.0, 6.9], p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.32). Effects on secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance. SIGNIFICANCE: This study extends previous research by demonstrating that emyna facilitates improvements in QoL in a diverse group of PwE treated in routine care settings. This CBT-based digital intervention therefore presents a convenient and cost-effective addition to healthcare providers' treatment repertoire. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In our study, we tested a digital program called emyna, which conveys cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to help improve the quality of life for people living with epilepsy. We found that those who used emyna alongside their usual treatments felt better about their quality of life compared to those who did not use the program. Emyna offers a new, convenient way for people with epilepsy to manage their condition, which can be used alongside currently available treatments."

Digital programs focusing on the psychosocial aspects of pain may provide low-barrier alternatives. AIMS: Through a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a multimodal mobile application. METHODS: Participants (n = 198; 82% women, mean age = 46.7 [13.1] years; mean pain duration 13.6 [11.2] years) with nonmalignant chronic pain were randomized to either a 6-week intervention (n = 98) or a wait-listed usual care group (n = 100). The intervention involved regular engagement with a user-guided mobile application (Curable Inc.) informed by the biopsychosocial model of pain that included pain education, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and expressive writing. The co-primary outcomes were pain severity and interference at 6 weeks. RESULTS: We observed significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group with estimated changes of -0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.04 to -0.29, P < .001, d = 0.43) and -0.60 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.03, P = .04, d = 0.27) for pain severity and interference, respectively. There were significant improvements across secondary outcomes (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System pain interference; pain catastrophizing; anxiety, depression; stress). Frequency of app use was correlated with improved pain interference (P < .001) and pain catastrophizing (P = 0.018), and changes from baseline persisted in the intervention group at 12 weeks (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term mobile app intervention resulted in significant improvements across physical and mental health outcomes compared to wait-listed usual care.

Bien que de plus en plus d'options de soins hybrides soient désormais disponibles, la capacité à fournir ces soins demeure un défi. Les programmes numériques qui se concentrent sur les aspects psychosociaux de la douleur peuvent offrir des solutions de rechange présentant peu de barrières.Objectifs : Dans le cadre d'un essai contrôlé randomisé, nous avons étudié l'efficacité d'une application mobile multimodale.Méthodes : Les participants (n = 198 ; 82 % de femmes, âge moyen = 46,7 [13,1] ans; durée moyenne de la douleur 13,6 [11,2] ans) souffrant de douleur chronique non cancéreuse ont été répartis au hasard entre une intervention de six semaines (n = 98) et un groupe de soins habituels sur liste d'attente (n = 100). L'intervention consistait en l’utilisation régulière d’une application mobile guidée par l'utilisateur, basée sur le modèle biopsychosocial de la douleur comprenant l'éducation à la douleur, la méditation, la thérapie cognitivo-comportementale et l'écriture expressive. Les résultats coprimaires étaient l'intensité de la douleur et l'interférence à six semaines.Résultats : Nous avons observé des améliorations significatives dans le groupe d'intervention par rapport au groupe témoin, avec des changements estimés de -0,67 (intervalle de confiance à 95 % [IC] -1,04 à -0,29, P < 0,001, d = 0,43) et -0,60 (IC 95 % -1,18 à -0,03, P = 0,04, d = 0,27) pour l'intensité de la douleur et l'interférence, respectivement. Des améliorations significatives ont été observées pour les résultats secondaires (interférence de la douleur selon le système d’information sur les mesures de résultats rapportés par les patients; catastrophisation de la douleur; anxiété; dépression et stress). La fréquence d'utilisation de l'application était corrélée à une amélioration de l'interférence de la douleur (P < 0,001) et de la catastrophisation de la douleur (P = 0,018). De plus, les changements par rapport à l'état initial ont persisté dans le groupe d'intervention après 12 semaines (P < 0,05).Conclusions : Une intervention à court terme au moyen d'une application mobile a permis d'améliorer de manière significative les résultats en matière de santé physique et mentale comparativement aux soins habituels sur liste d'attente."

However, little is known about the clinical effects of integrating mobile technology into these interventions. Because users carry their smartphones with them throughout the day, we hypothesize that this technology can be used to significantly support individuals with monitoring and overcoming their PD symptoms. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed hybrid intervention that combines internet/PC with smartphone delivery to treat the symptoms of PD. The intervention is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and consists of six modules over a total of six weeks. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effects of a hybrid online training module for PD. Based on a power calculation (d =0.60; 1-β of 80%; α =0.05), 90 participants with mild to moderate panic symptoms with or without agoraphobia (as assessed by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale) will be recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. The primary outcome measure will be the severity of panic symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include depression, quality of life, and an observer-based rating of panic severity. Furthermore, data regarding acceptance and the usability of the smartphone app will be assessed. Assessments will take place at baseline as well as eight weeks, three months, and six months after randomization. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this RCT is one of the first to examine the efficacy of a hybrid online training for adult PD. This study seeks to contribute to the emerging field of hybrid online training. If the intervention is efficacious, then research on this hybrid online training should be extended. The cost-effectiveness analysis will also indicate whether online training is an economical tool for treating PD among adults.

Given the high prevalence of these risk behaviours, effective interventions with potential for wide reach are warranted. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this two-arm RCT will be to test the effect of a three month personalised mobile app intervention on two main outcomes: minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and overall sleep quality. In addition, between-group changes in health-related quality of life and mental health status will be assessed as secondary outcomes. The pre-specified mediators and moderators include social cognitive factors, the neighbourhood environment, health (BMI, depression, anxiety, stress), sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education) and app usage. Assessments will be conducted after three months (primary endpoint) and six months (follow-up). The intervention will provide access to a specifically developed mobile app, through which participants can set goals for active minutes, daily step counts, resistance training, sleep times and sleep hygiene practice. The app also allows participants to log their behaviours daily and view progress bars as well as instant feedback in relation to goals. The personalised support system will consist of weekly summary reports, educational and instructional materials, prompts on disengagement and weekly facts.

We developed a universal cognitive behavioural therapy-based programme (MEMO CBT) to be delivered via multimedia mobile phone messages for teens. METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial in 15 high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, comparing MEMO CBT with a control programme [MEMO control] matched for intensity and type of message but with alternative content not targeting depression. The primary outcome was the change in score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores in the self-reported Reynold's Adolescent Depression Rating Scale-Second Edition, the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire, suicidal ideation using selected items from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, the Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, 12-month period prevalence of the diagnosis of depressive disorder using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and students' ratings of their satisfaction with the programme. RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-five students (13-17 years old, mean 14.3 years) were randomly assigned to MEMO CBT (426) or to MEMO Control (429). Participants (68% female) had a mean CDRS-R at baseline of 21.5 (SD: 5). Overall 394 (93%) from the intervention group and 392 (91%) from the control group were followed up at 12 months. At the end of the intervention (approximately 9 weeks) the mean CDRS-R scores were 20.8 in the intervention group versus 20.4 in the control group, and at 12 months they were 22.4 versus 22.4 (p value for difference in change from baseline = 0.3). There was no obvious association between the amount of the intervention viewed by participants and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of benefit from the mobile phone CBT intervention compared with a control programme. Universal depression prevention remains a challenge."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the efficacy of email versus SMS text messaging as delivery platforms for supporting patients with MDD, addressing a critical gap in understanding optimal digital interventions for mental health care. METHODS: A randomized noninferiority pilot trial was conducted, comparing outcomes for patients receiving 6-week daily supportive messages via email with those receiving messages via SMS text message. This duration corresponds to a minimum of 180 days of message delivery. The supportive messages maintained consistent length and structure across both delivery methods. Participants (N=66) were recruited from the Access 24/7 clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, among those who were diagnosed with MDD. The outcomes were measured at baseline and 6 months after enrollment using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). RESULTS: Most of the participants were females (n=43, 65%), aged between 26 and 40 years (n=34, 55%), had high school education (n=35, 58%), employed (n=33, 50%), and single (n=24, 36%). Again, most participants had had no history of any major physical illness (n=56, 85%) and (n=61, 92%) responded ""No"" to having a history of admission for treatment of mood disorders. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean changes in PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WHO-5 scores between the email and SMS text messaging groups (mean difference, 95% CI: -1.90, 95% CI -6.53 to 2.74; 5.78, 95% CI -1.94 to 13.50; and 11.85, 95% CI -3.81 to 27.51), respectively. Both supportive modalities showed potential in reducing depressive symptoms and improving quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings suggest that both email and SMS text messaging interventions have equivalent effectiveness in reducing depression symptoms among individuals with MDD. As digital technology continues to evolve, harnessing the power of multiple digital platforms for mental health interventions can significantly contribute to bridging the existing treatment gaps and improving the overall well-being of individuals with depressive conditions. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to confirm and expand upon these findings.

10.1192/bjo.2025.8,Development of a Multiuser Interactive Health Response Application (MITHRA) for depression in women from a community-based organisation in India,"Ruben JP, Devadass D, Goud BR, Navarro-Aguirre Y, Kalidindi B, Waghmare A, Raj T, Srinivasan K, Collins PY, Bhat A.",BJPsych Open,2025,2025.3.25,,,"BACKGROUND: In India, women in rural areas have high rates of depression. They have poor access to mental healthcare resources and, hence, mental health symptoms remain largely unaddressed. Existing mobile telephone applications (apps) do not engage end-users, lack local language options, may not be socioculturally relevant and do not use audiovisual formats. We thus developed a mobile mental health app, Multiuser Interactive Health Response Application (MITHRA), to screen and provide brief behavioural intervention for mild to moderate depression among rural women attending self-help groups (SHGs) in India. AIMS: This qualitative study explores the process and findings of focus groups conducted with SHG administrators and women to inform the iterative development of the MITHRA app. METHOD: In total, 22 participants were interviewed (17 SHG participants and five administrators), and a thematic analysis of the data was conducted using the acceptability of interventions framework. RESULTS: Frequent themes across the focus groups were affective attitude, burden, self-efficacy and perceived effectiveness. All women showed a positive attitude towards the app and depression interventions, while older women demonstrated less self-efficacy in using mobile mental health apps. CONCLUSIONS: MITHRA is a promising app in the management of mild to moderate depression in women in SHG. With adequate training and education of family members, MITHRA has the potential to identify and treat women with mild to moderate depression."

Building emotional competence (EC) skills via a mobile app may be an effective, scalable and acceptable way to do this. However, few large-scale controlled trials have examined the efficacy of mobile apps in promoting mental health in young people; none have tailored the app to individual profiles. METHOD/DESIGN: The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) involves a longitudinal prospective cohort to examine well-being, mental health and EC in 16-22 year olds across 12 months. Within the cohort, eligible participants are entered to either the PREVENT trial (if selected EC scores at baseline within worst-performing quartile) or to the PROMOTE trial (if selected EC scores not within worst-performing quartile). In both trials, participants are randomised (i) to continue with usual practice, repeated assessments and a self-monitoring app; (ii) to additionally receive generic cognitive-behavioural therapy self-help in app; (iii) to additionally receive personalised EC self-help in app. In total, 2142 participants aged 16 to 22 years, with no current or past history of major depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis will be recruited across UK, Germany, Spain, and Belgium. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 1, 3 and 12 months post-randomisation. Primary endpoint and outcome for PREVENT is level of depression symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at 3 months; primary endpoint and outcome for PROMOTE is emotional well-being assessed on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale at 3 months. Depressive symptoms, anxiety, well-being, health-related quality of life, functioning and cost-effectiveness are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored. CONCLUSIONS: The trial aims to provide a better understanding of the causal role of learning EC skills using interventions delivered via mobile phone apps with respect to promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young people. This knowledge will be used to develop and disseminate innovative evidence-based, feasible, and effective Mobile-health public health strategies for preventing poor mental health and promoting well-being.

However, few have been the subject of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the change processes that are hypothesized to mediate claimed effects have not been previously studied. This RCT compared the efficacy of three publicly available MHapps to a waitlist control condition in a community sample, in which no MHapp was provided. The three MHapps included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) toolkit app MoodKit, mood tracking app MoodPrism, and CBT strategy app MoodMission. Participants were randomly allocated to each condition, completed a baseline assessment, downloaded their allocated MHapp, and completed a second assessment 30 days later, with n = 226 included in final analyses (81% female; M age = 34 years). Compared to the control condition, all MHapp groups experienced increases in mental wellbeing, MoodKit and MoodMission groups experienced decreases in depression, and no groups experienced effects on anxiety. Mediated regressions revealed that increasing coping self-efficacy, rather than emotional self-awareness or mental health literacy, was the underlying process contributing to effects on mental health for all three MHapps. MHapps appear to be an effective solution for improving public mental health, notably by improving users' confidence in their ability to cope."

Research shows that smartphone-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with coaching may be a scalable and effective treatment for BDD. However, evidence for long-term gain maintenance is limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to examine the long-term outcomes of a smartphone-based CBT for BDD. METHOD: Adults with a primary diagnosis of BDD who completed a 12-week course of smartphone-delivered CBT with coach support were evaluated 3- and 12-months posttreatment. Symptom severity, remission and responder status were assessed with the clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS). Secondary outcomes were also evaluated and included BDD-related insight, depression, functioning and quality of life. Data were analyzed using four different approaches to missing data, with maximum likelihood estimation as the main approach. RESULTS: There was significant attrition from posttreatment (n = 57) to 3-month (n = 49) and 12-month (n = 33) follow-up. The mean BDD-YBOCS severity score remained stable during the follow-up period [Estimated Mean (SE) at posttreatment, 3-months, and 12-months = 18.7(1.1), 18.9(1.2) and 18.8(1.3), respectively]. The proportion of participants responding to treatment and in remission remained relatively unchanged as well (63 % responders and 46 % remitters at posttreatment, 54 % and 35 % at 3-month follow-up, and 61 % and 37 % at 12-month follow-up, respectively). Posttreatment gains in BDD-related insight, functioning, and quality of life were maintained; there were small increases in depression (ES = 0.36) from posttreatment to 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements after coach-supported smartphone-based CBT for BDD are maintained one year after treatment."
10.2196/49317,HealthySMS Text Messaging System Adjunct to Adolescent Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Context of COVID-19 (Let's Text!): Pilot Feasibility and Acceptability Study,"Haack LM, Armstrong CC, Travis K, Aguilera A, Darrow SM.",JMIR Ment Health,2024,2024.2.19,,,"BACKGROUND: The widespread occurrence and devastating impact of adolescent depression warrant health service research focused on feasible and acceptable digital health tools to supplement evidence-based intervention (EBI) efforts, particularly in the context of shelter-in-place guidelines disrupting youth socialization and service use in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the promise of SMS text message interventions to enhance EBI engagement, our team developed the HealthySMS system as an adjunct to one of the most empirically supported interventions for adolescent depression: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group services. The system sends daily SMS text messages requesting responses assessing mood, thoughts, and activities; weekly attendance reminder messages; daily tips about adherence (eg, a prompt for activity completion); and personalized responses based on participants' texts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of HealthySMS in a real-world setting and explore potential mechanisms of change in EBI engagement, before evaluating the system's impact on adolescents' group CBT engagement and, ultimately, depression outcomes. METHODS: Over the course of 2020, we invited all 20 adolescents receiving CBT group services for depression at an outpatient psychiatry clinic to enroll in our HealthySMS study; ultimately, 17 (85%) adolescents agreed to participate. We tracked participant initiation and engagement with the HealthySMS system as well as the content of SMS text message responses to HealthySMS. We also invited each participant to engage in a semistructured interview to gather additional qualitative inputs on the system. RESULTS: All (n=17, 100%) research participants invited agreed to receive HealthySMS messages, and 94% (16/17) of the participants maintained use during the first month without opting out. We uncovered meaningful qualitative themes regarding the feasibility and acceptability of HealthySMS, as well as its potential impact on EBI engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of this pilot study suggest that HealthySMS adjunct to adolescent CBT group depression services is feasible and acceptable, as evidenced by high rates of HealthySMS initiation and low rates of dropout, as well as meaningful themes uncovered from participants' qualitative feedback. In addition, the findings provide evidence regarding iterative improvements to the HealthySMS system and research protocol, as well as potential mechanisms of change for enhanced EBI engagement and, ultimately, adolescent depression outcomes, which can be used in future effectiveness research."

Here we report the protocol of a randomised controlled trial of the effects of emotion recognition training on mood in a sample of individuals with depressive symptoms over a 6-week follow-up period. METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 190 adults from the general population who report high levels of depressive symptoms (defined as a score ≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II). Participants will attend a screening session and will be randomised to intervention or control procedures, repeated five times over consecutive days (Monday to Friday). A follow-up session will take place at end-of -treatment, 2-weeks and 6-weeks after training. Our primary study outcome will be depressive symptoms, Beck Depression Inventory- II (rated over the past two weeks). Our secondary outcomes are: depressive symptoms, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; anxiety symptoms, Beck Anxiety Inventory (rated over the past month); positive affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); negative affect, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (rated as 'how you feel right now'); emotion sensitivity, Emotion Recognition Task (test phase); approach motivation and persistence, the Fishing Game; and depressive interpretation bias, Scrambled Sentences Test. DISCUSSION: This study is of a novel cognitive bias modification technique that targets biases in emotional processing characteristic of depression, and can be delivered automatically via computer, Internet or Smartphone. It therefore has potential to be a valuable cost-effective adjunctive treatment for depression which may be used together with more traditional psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy.

We evaluated a new, brief POI for depression and conducted exploratory moderator analyses. METHODS: In this online trial (German Clinical Trials Register; DRKS00011045), we allocated participants to treatment as usual (TAU; n = 67) or POI (n = 65). At first, we randomized participants; later we allocated participants based on depression severity in order to counter baseline differences. The unguided POI addressed behavioral activation and depressive thinking in a single module with 25 webpages (including a smartphone application). We did one assessment at baseline and a post-assessment four weeks later. RESULTS: At post-assessment, depression (p = .586), behavioral activation (p = .332), and dysfunctional attitudes (p = .499) did not differ between groups. When concurrent treatments (medication/psychotherapy) remained constant/decreased, the POI outperformed TAU (p = .031). POI-participants with lower willingness to change (p = .030) or higher education (p = .017) were less likely to worsen (i.e., experience increased depressive symptoms) compared to TAU. DISCUSSION: The targeted sample size was not reached, measurements were self-reported, and randomization failed. The POI's content may have been too limited. Concurrent treatments, which were more often sought out by TAU participants, diminished group differences and should be considered in future studies. Brief POIs may protect against worsening of depressive symptoms among highly educated participants or those with low willingness to change."

METHODS: A total of 49 non-specialist trainees participated. Six digital training modules were flexibly delivered over a 5-week period. Training included a chatroom, moderated by a supervised assistant psychologist. Quantitatively, feasibility was assessed via participation and retention levels; acceptability was examined using course evaluation questionnaires; and effectiveness was measured pre-test-post-test quantitatively using a self-report questionnaire and pre-post using scenario questions. Participant focus groups explored feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness. RESULTS: The training was feasible; 41 completed the course and 42 were assessed at follow-up. Quantitative course evaluation and thematic analysis of focus group feedback demonstrated high training acceptability. RANOVAs indicated training significantly improved knowledge and confidence pre- to post-test. There were demonstrable increases in specific skills at post-test as assessed via clinical scenarios. CONCLUSION: This training is a feasible, acceptable and effective way to upskill non-specialists in supporting treatment for PND, however supervised practice is recommended to ensure participants embed knowledge competently into practice. The training offers an effective first step in upskilling non-specialist supporters to support women with PND treatment at scale."
10.2196/65357,The EmpkinS-EKSpression Reappraisal Training Augmented With Kinesthesia in Depression: One-Armed Feasibility Study,"Keinert M, Schindler-Gmelch L, Rupp LH, Sadeghi M, Richer R, Capito K, Eskofier BM, Berking M.",JMIR Form Res,2025,2025.4.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Harboring dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions contributes to the development and maintenance of depression. A central goal of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression is to invalidate such cognitions via cognitive reappraisal (CR). However, relatively low remission rates and high dropout rates in CBT demonstrate the need for further improvement. Potentially, the effects of CBT could be enhanced by addressing not only dysfunctional depressogenic cognitions but also body states associated with depression. This may be done, for example, by systematically pairing the invalidation of depressogenic cognitions with the performance of antidepressive kinesthesia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the feasibility and clinical potential of a smartphone-based cognitive restructuring task that required users to deliberately perform antidepressive kinesthesia in conjunction with the rejection of depressogenic statements and the affirmation of antidepressive statements. This feasibility study was conducted as a precursor to a large-scale randomized controlled trial. METHODS: In total, 10 healthy participants engaged in a single 90-120-minute session of smartphone-based CR training. During the training, they completed 2 phases in which they were required to reject 20 depressogenic and affirm 20 antidepressive statements, respectively. Diagnostic assessments were conducted 1 week (T1) before and directly prior (T2) to the training, and again directly posttraining (T3) and at a 2-week follow-up posttraining (T4). Feasibility outcomes assessed at T3 included intervention safety recorded by study therapists, compliance, technical feasibility, usability assessed using the Short Version of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S), and acceptability assessed using the UEQ-S and self-developed items. Preliminary clinical potential was evaluated via single-item ratings of current depressed and positive mood assessed continuously during the training. Feasibility outcomes were analyzed descriptively, and clinical potential was examined using paired-sample t tests of pre and post ratings of mood at each training phase. RESULTS: Overall, the results indicated that the training was safe, feasible, and usable (UEQ-S pragmatic quality scale: mean 1.45, SD 0.71). However, acceptance was limited (UEQ-S hedonic quality scale: mean 1.05, SD 0.79). While 80% (8/10) of the participants were generally satisfied with the training, 80% (8/10) would recommend it to a friend, 90% (9/10) found it interesting, and 80% (8/10) rated it as ""leading edge,"" 40% (4/10) to 70% (7/10) did not consider it particularly helpful and 50% (5/10) found it repetitive. Preliminary results regarding clinical potential were promising, with significant increases in positive mood (rejection: Hedges g=0.63; affirmation: Hedges g=0.25), whereas changes in depressed mood were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone-based CR training augmented with validating and invalidating kinesthesia. This provided valuable insights for further optimizing the intervention for the subsequent randomized controlled trial, but also potential similar interventions. If future studies confirm their clinical potential, such interventions offer a promising approach to enhancing CBT for depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: OSF Registries pw6ma; https://osf.io/pw6ma/."

However, few measures exist to study the role of the SA model on coached digital interventions. We developed the Supportive Accountability Inventory (SAI) and evaluated the underlying factor structure and psychometric properties of this brief self-report measure. METHOD: Using data from a two-arm randomized trial of a remote intervention for major depressive disorder (telephone CBT [tCBT] or a stepped care model of web-based CBT [iCBT] and tCBT), we conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis on the SAI item pool and explored the final SAI's relationship to iCBT engagement as well as to depression outcomes. Participants in our analyses (n = 52) included those randomized to a receive iCBT, but were not stepped up to tCBT due to insufficient response to iCBT, had not remitted prior to the 10-week assessment point, and completed the pool of 8 potential SAI items. RESULTS: The best fitting EFA model included only 6 items from the original pool of 8 and contained two factors: Monitoring and Expectation. Final model fit was mixed, but acceptable (χ 2 (4) = 5.24, p = 0.26; RMSR = 0.03; RMSEA = 0.091; TLI = 0.967). Internal consistency was acceptable at α = 0.68. The SAI demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity. The SAI at the 10-week/mid-treatment mark was significantly associated with the number of days of iCBT use (r = 0.29, p = .037), but, contrary to expectations, was not predictive of either PHQ-9 scores (F(2,46) = 0.14, p = .89) or QIDS-C scores (F(2,46) = 0.84, p = .44) at post-treatment. CONCLUSION: The SAI is a brief measure of the SA framework constructs. Continued development to improve the SAI and expand the constructs it assesses is necessary, but the SAI represents the first step towards a measure of a coaching protocol that can support both coached digital mental health intervention adherence and improved outcomes."

Adolescents with depressive symptoms and a history of peer violence were recruited from an urban emergency department. Forty-one participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis using deductive and inductive codes were used to capture a priori and emerging themes. Five major themes were identified: CBT-based messages resonated with at-risk adolescents; high levels of peer violence, comorbid symptoms, and prior exposure to the mental health system were variables affecting preferred content; participants endorsed emotional regulation messages, but found mindfulness content difficult to understand via SMS; cognitive awareness and restructuring content was most acceptable when framed by self-efficacy content; adolescent participants generated applicable CBT content in their own voices. Overall, CBT-informed content was able to be distilled into 160-character text messages without losing its comprehensibility."

Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended as the first line of treatment. Digital health interventions, such as apps, could contribute to treatment. Advantages could be easy accessibility and availability, reduced time for face-to-face therapy, and the ability to intensify therapy by incorporating it into the patients' everyday lives. Challenges such as low adherence rates are common in digital health interventions. Therefore, they need to undergo rigorous testing for feasibility and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: An evaluated, cognitive behavioral therapy-based face-to-face therapy program for depression in adolescents was transformed into an app called e-MICHI. This study examined its feasibility and efficacy for use in blended therapy in outpatient settings. METHODS: Adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with major depressive disorder receiving outpatient care were recruited from 2 university hospitals (n=36 included in analysis). The e-MICHI intervention combined daily app engagement over 6 weeks with 3 face-to-face sessions with a therapist. Feasibility was measured using various variables, including an adherence score (0=no or little patient engagement to 3=excellent engagement) and engagement rates (number of modules completed, number of messages sent by participants via the in-app messenger), satisfaction ratings from both participants and therapists, as well as participants' ratings of the usefulness of the antidepressant strategies covered in the app and the transfer of these strategies to everyday practice. Trends of efficacy were evaluated from multiple perspectives (participant self-rating, independent rater, or therapist), using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale. Feasibility metrics were assessed by analyzing their central tendency and dispersion, efficacy data were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: e-MICHI was positively evaluated by both participants and therapists (participants: mean 7.3, SD 1.2 and therapists: mean 7.3, SD 1.1, on a scale from 0=bad to 10=excellent). Participants demonstrated high adherence rates (nearly 80%, n=25, received a ""good"" or ""excellent"" adherence score) and showed overall good engagement (app modules completed [maximum 6]: mean 5.03, SD 1.27 and messages sent via messenger: mean 23, SD 22.1). Participants rated the psychoeducational content of the app as particularly useful and reported consistent practice of the e-MICHI strategies in everyday life. Use of the app was associated with a significant reduction of depressive symptoms (before app use vs 3-month follow-up, Beck Depression Inventory-II: mean -6.76, SD 11.49, P=.01; Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised: mean -16.45, SD 16.76, P<.001; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale: mean -1.1, SD 1.24, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: While acknowledging its limitations, such as the small number of participants and the limited validity concerning efficacy, this study confirms the feasibility of e-MICHI for treating adolescent depression in outpatient settings."

It may lead to mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, resulting in increased work absences and disabilities. Scalable interventions to prevent and manage harmful stress can be delivered with the help of technology tools to support self-observations and skills training. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the P4Well intervention in treatment of stress-related psychological problems. P4Well is a novel intervention which combines modern psychotherapy (the cognitive behavioral therapy and the acceptance and commitment therapy) with personal health technologies to deliver the intervention via multiple channels, includinggroup meetings, Internet/Web portal, mobile phone applications, and personal monitoring devices. METHODS: This pilot study design was a small-scale randomized controlled trial that compared the P4Well intervention with a waiting list control group. In addition to personal health technologies for self-assessment, the intervention consisted of 3 psychologist-assisted group meetings. Self-assessed psychological measures through questionnaires were collected offline pre- and post-intervention, and 6 months after the intervention for the intervention group. Acceptance and usage of technology tools were measured with user experience questionnaires and usage logs. RESULTS: A total of 24 subjects were randomized: 11 participants were followed up in the intervention group (1 was lost to follow-up) and 12 participants did not receive any intervention (control group). Depressive and psychological symptoms decreased and self-rated health and working ability increased. All participants reported they had benefited from the intervention. All technology tools had active users and 10/11 participants used at least 1 tool actively. Physiological measurements with personal feedback were considered the most useful intervention component. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the feasibility of the intervention and suggest that it had positive effects on psychological symptoms, self-rated health, and self-rated working ability. The intervention seemed to have a positive impact on certain aspects of burnout and job strain, such as cynicism and over-commitment. Future studies need to investigate the effectiveness, benefits, and possible problems of psychological interventions which incorporate new technologies.

METHODS: From January 2021 to December 2022, of the 9657 individuals, aged 18 years or older, who downloaded and completed the KANOPEE screening interview and had either subclinical or clinical insomnia symptoms, 4295 (44.5%) dropped out (ie, did not return to the app to continue filling in subsequent assessments). The primary outcome was a binary variable: having dropped out after completing the screening assessment (early dropout) or having completed all the treatment phases (n=551). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of dropout among a set of sociodemographic, clinical, and sleep diary variables, and users' perceptions of the treatment program, collected during the screening interview. RESULTS: The users' mean age was 47.95 (SD 15.21) years. Of those who dropped out early and those who completed the treatment, 65.1% (3153/4846) were women and 34.9% (1693/4846) were men. Younger age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99), lower education level (compared to middle school; high school: AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90; bachelor's degree: AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23-0.52; master's degree or higher: AOR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.55), poorer nocturnal sleep (sleep efficiency: AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96; number of nocturnal awakenings: AOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23), and more severe depression symptoms (AOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.21) were significant predictors of dropping out. When measures of perceptions of the app were included in the model, perceived benevolence and credibility of the VA decreased the odds of dropout (AOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: As in traditional face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, the presence of significant depression symptoms plays an important role in treatment dropout. This variable represents an important target to address to increase early engagement with fully automated insomnia management programs. Furthermore, our results support the contention that a VA can provide relevant user stimulation that will eventually pay out in terms of user engagement."

Digital interventions, such as internet-administered cognitive behavioral therapy, offer an accessible and flexible means to support parents. However, engagement with and adherence to digital interventions remain a significant challenge, potentially limiting efficacy. Understanding factors influencing user engagement and adherence is crucial for enhancing the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of these interventions. We developed an internet-administered, guided, low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (LICBT)-based self-help intervention for parents of children treated for cancer, (EJDeR [internetbaserad självhjälp för föräldrar till barn som avslutat en behandling mot cancer or internet-based self-help for parents of children who have completed cancer treatment]). EJDeR included 2 LICBT techniques-behavioral activation and worry management. Subsequently, we conducted the ENGAGE feasibility trial and EJDeR was found to be acceptable and feasible. However, intervention adherence rates were marginally under progression criteria. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) describe user engagement with the EJDeR intervention and examine whether (2) sociodemographic characteristics differed between adherers and nonadherers, (3) depression and anxiety scores differed between adherers and nonadherers at baseline, (4) user engagement differed between adherers and nonadherers, and (5) user engagement differed between fathers and mothers. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of ENGAGE data, including 71 participants. User engagement data were collected through log-data tracking, for example, communication with e-therapists, homework submissions, log-ins, minutes working with EJDeR, and modules completed. Chi-square tests examined differences between adherers and nonadherers and fathers and mothers concerning categorical data. Independent-samples t tests examined differences regarding continuous variables. RESULTS: Module completion rates were higher among those who worked with behavioral activation as their first LICBT module versus worry management. Of the 20 nonadherers who opened the first LICBT module allocated, 30% (n=6) opened behavioral activation and 70% (n=14) opened worry management. No significant differences in sociodemographic characteristics were found. Nonadherers who opened behavioral activation as the first LICBT module allocated had a significantly higher level of depression symptoms at baseline than adherers. No other differences in depression and anxiety scores between adherers and nonadherers were found. Minutes working with EJDeR, number of log-ins, days using EJDeR, number of written messages sent to e-therapists, number of written messages sent to participants, and total number of homework exercises submitted were significantly higher among adherers than among nonadherers. There were no significant differences between fathers and mothers regarding user engagement variables. CONCLUSIONS: Straightforward techniques, such as behavioral activation, may be well-suited for digital delivery, and more complex techniques, such as worry management, may require modifications to improve user engagement. User engagement was measured behaviorally, for example, through log-data tracking, and future research should measure emotional and cognitive components of engagement.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess qualitative feedback from participants to determine if there were differences between Spanish speakers and English speakers. Daily text messages were sent to patients as an adjunct to group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression. METHODS: Messages inquired about mood and about specific themes (thoughts, activities, social interactions) of a manualized group CBT intervention. There were thirty-nine patients who participated in the text messaging pilot study. The average age of the participants was 53 years (SD 10.4; range of 23-72). RESULTS: Qualitative feedback from Spanish speakers highlighted feelings of social support, whereas English speakers noted increased introspection and self-awareness of their mood state. CONCLUSIONS: These cultural differences should be explored further, as they may impact the effect of supportive mobile health interventions.

""Whitu: seven ways in seven days"" is an app based on positive psychology, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation principles. METHODS: Ninety-first year university students (45 per arm) participated in a randomised controlled trial of Whitu against a university self-help website (""Be Well""). Primary outcomes were changes in well-being on the World Health Organisation 5-item well-being index (WHO-5) and the short Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale (SWEMWBS). Secondary outcomes were changes in depression, anxiety, self-compassion, stress, sleep and self-reported acceptability of the app. RESULTS: At 4 weeks (primary endpoint), participants in the intervention group experienced significantly higher mental well-being (mean difference: 2.53 (95%CI: 0.53, 4.52); p = 0.013) and significantly lower depression (-4.23 (-8.32, -0.15); p = 0.042), compared to controls. Emotional well-being was greater in the intervention group at 3 months (12.23 (3.93, 20.54; p = 0.004). Other outcomes were similar between groups.

The purpose was to quantify changes in mental and physical quality of life and depressive symptoms across pregnancy and the postpartum period, to determine the association between gestational weight gain and change in mood and quality of life, and to assess the effect of a behavioral intervention targeting excess gestational weight gain on these outcomes. METHODS: A three group parallel-arm randomized controlled pilot trial of 54 pregnant women who were overweight or obese was conducted to test whether the SmartMoms® intervention decreased the proportion of women with excess gestational weight gain. Individuals randomized to Usual Care (n = 17) did not receive any weight management services from interventionists. Individuals randomized to the SmartMoms® intervention (n = 37) were provided with behavioral weight management counseling by interventionists either in clinic (In-Person, n = 18) or remotely through a smartphone application (Phone, n = 19). In a subset of 43 women, mood and mental and physical quality of life were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Rand 12-Item short form, respectively, in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, 1-2 months postpartum, and 12 months postpartum. RESULTS: The SmartMoms® intervention and Usual Care groups had higher depressive symptoms (p < 0.03 for SmartMoms® intervention, p < 0.01 for Usual Care) and decreased physical health (p < 0.01) from early to late pregnancy. Both groups returned to early pregnancy mood and physical quality of life postpartum. Mental health did not change from early to late pregnancy (p = 0.8), from early pregnancy to 1-2 months (p = 0.5), or from early pregnancy to 12 months postpartum (p = 0.9), respectively. There were no significant intervention effects. Higher gestational weight gain was associated with worsened mood and lower physical quality of life across pregnancy. CONCLUSION: High depressive symptoms and poor quality of life may be interrelated with the incidence of excess gestational weight gain. The behavioral gestational weight gain intervention did not significantly impact these outcomes, but mood and quality of life should be considered within future interventions and clinical practice to effectively limit excess gestational weight gain.

Digital technologies such as smartphones show promise for supporting and enhancing these treatments by linking immediate therapeutic settings to the context of daily life. Two promising technologies include ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I), which may offer a means of advanced assessment and support in daily life, and inform the tailoring of interventions to suit individual needs. In this study, a highly novel intervention approach was developed involving four face-to-face sessions with a psychologist blended with EMA/I between sessions in order to improve coping with distressing voice hearing experiences. The authors describe the background and development of this approach along-side a single case illustration, which supported feasibility and acceptability.

However, guided digital interventions may be costly for low- and middle-income countries, despite their effectiveness. In this randomised control trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of two digital interventions designed to address this issue: (1) a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Skills Training (CST) intervention that increased scalability by using remote online group administration; and (2) the SuperBetter gamified self-guided CBT skills training app, which uses other participants rather than paid staff as guides. The study was implemented among anxious and/or depressed South African undergraduates (n = 371) randomised with equal allocation to Remote Group CST, SuperBetter, or a MoodFlow mood monitoring control. Symptoms were assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Intention-to-treat analysis found effect sizes at the high end of prior digital intervention trials, including significantly higher adjusted risk differences (ARD; primary outcome) in joint anxiety/depression remission at 3-months and 6-months for Remote Group CST (ARD = 23.3-18.9%, p = 0.001-0.035) and SuperBetter (ARD = 12.7-22.2%, p = 0.047-0.006) than MoodFlow and mean combined PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores (secondary outcome) significantly lower for Remote Group CST and SuperBetter than MoodFlow.

Pharmacological treatment, despite controversy, is commonly chosen due to resource limitations and difficulties in accessing face-to-face interventions. Depression significantly impacts various aspects of a person's life, affecting adherence to medical prescriptions and glycemic control and leading to future complications and increased health care costs. To address these challenges, information and communication technologies (eg, eHealth) have been introduced, showing promise in improving treatment continuity and accessibility. However, while eHealth programs have demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms, evidence regarding glycemic control remains inconclusive. This randomized controlled trial aimed to test the efficacy of a low-intensity psychological intervention via a web app for mild-moderate depressive symptoms in individuals with T2DM compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in PC. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a web-based psychological intervention to treat depressive symptomatology in people with T2DM compared with TAU in a PC setting. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 patients with T2DM, depressive symptoms of moderate severity, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.47% in PC settings. Patients were randomized to TAU (n=27) or a web-based psychological treatment group (n=22). This web-based treatment consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, improvement of diabetes self-care behaviors, and mindfulness. Cost-effectiveness analysis for the improvement of depressive symptomatology was conducted based on reductions in 3, 5, or 50 points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The efficacy of diabetes control was estimated based on a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c levels. Follow-up was performed at 3 and 6 months. The cost-utility analysis was performed based on quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS: Efficacy analysis showed that the web-based treatment program was more effective in improving depressive symptoms than TAU but showed only a slight improvement in HbA1c. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 186.76 for a 3-point reduction in PHQ-9 and 206.31 for reductions of 5 and 50 percentage points were obtained. In contrast, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for improving HbA1c levels amounted to €1510.90 (€1=US $1.18 in 2018) per participant. The incremental cost-utility ratio resulted in €4119.33 per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention, using web-based modules incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy tools, diabetes self-care promotion, and mindfulness, effectively reduced depressive symptoms and enhanced glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Notably, it demonstrated clinical efficacy and economic efficiency. This supports the idea that eHealth interventions not only benefit patients clinically but also offer cost-effectiveness for health care systems. The study emphasizes the importance of including specific modules to enhance diabetes self-care behaviors in future web-based psychological interventions, emphasizing personalization and adaptation for this population.

Although designed to serve individuals who are well or have mild depression and anxiety symptoms, mindline.sg may potentially be used by clinicians as an adjunct therapeutic aid for patients with clinically diagnosed mental disorders. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the perceived usability, acceptability, and usefulness of mindline.sg among individuals with diagnosed mental disorders in a clinical setting. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 173 participants was conducted in the waiting room of a psychiatrist's office at the National University Hospital in Singapore. Participants waiting for an appointment were given 30 minutes and a simple set of instructions to use three features of mindline.sg. They subsequently answered a set of web-based survey questions via their smartphones, including a 16-item subset of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) for usability measurement and 5 questions designed to understand the perceived usefulness and acceptability of mindline.sg. Multiple linear regression is used to determine the associated demographic factors with overall PSSUQ score. A chi-square test is performed to investigate associations of psychiatric condition with users' responses on acceptability and perceived usefulness of mindline.sg. For this study, P<.05 is considered significant. RESULTS: We observed that the overall (mean 2.86, SD 1.46), system usefulness (mean 2.74, SD 1.46), and information quality (mean 2.98, SD 1.33) subscores of the PSSUQ survey are within a 99% CI of a literature-derived norm, which all have the interpretation of having high perceived usability. However, interface quality (mean 2.98, SD 1.33) scored lower than the literature-derived norm, although it is still better than the neutral score of 4. We find participants with lower than a General Certificate of Education O-Level or N-Level education tend to give a lower usability score as compared to others (β=.49; P=.02). Participants who have not been hospitalized previously due to their condition are also more likely to give a lower PSSUQ score as compared to individuals who have been hospitalized (β=.18; P=.03). The platform mindline.sg is also deemed to be generally useful and acceptable with all the survey questions receiving more than a 60% positive response. We found no association between the type(s) of self-reported psychiatric disorder(s) and the perceived usefulness and acceptability of mindline.sg. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that mindline.sg is generally perceived as usable and acceptable by individuals with a diagnosed mental disorder in Singapore. The study suggests improving usability among individuals with lower education levels. Particularly promising is the finding that previously hospitalized individuals have significantly higher perceived usability and satisfaction of the website, suggesting potential impact could be found among a moderately to severely at-risk clinical population. The effectiveness of mindline.sg as an adjunct therapy for individuals with diagnosed mental disorders should therefore be explored in future studies."

Mobile app-based CBTi (MCBTi) can enhance the accessibility of CBTi treatment; however, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of MCBTi using a multicenter, randomized controlled trial design. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the efficacy of Somzz, an MCBTi that provides real-time and tailored feedback to users, through comparison with an active comparator app. METHODS: In our multicenter, single-blind randomized controlled trial study, participants were recruited from 3 university hospitals and randomized into a Somzz group and a sleep hygiene education (SHE) group at a 1:1 ratio. The intervention included 6 sessions for 6 weeks, with follow-up visits over a 4-month period. The Somzz group received audiovisual sleep education, guidance on relaxation therapy, and real-time feedback on sleep behavior. The primary outcome was the Insomnia Severity Index score, and secondary outcomes included sleep diary measures and mental health self-reports. We analyzed the outcomes based on the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: A total of 98 participants were randomized into the Somzz (n=49, 50%) and SHE (n=49, 50%) groups. Insomnia Severity Index scores for the Somzz group were significantly lower at the postintervention time point (9.0 vs 12.8; t95=3.85; F2,95=22.76; ηp2=0.13; P<.001) and at the 3-month follow-up visit (11.3 vs 14.7; t68=2.61; F2,68=5.85; ηp2=0.03; P=.01) compared to those of the SHE group. The Somzz group maintained their treatment effect at the postintervention time point and follow-ups, with a moderate to large effect size (Cohen d=-0.62 to -1.35; P<.01 in all cases). Furthermore, the Somzz group showed better sleep efficiency (t95=-3.32; F2,91=69.87; ηp2=0.41; P=.001), wake after sleep onset (t95=2.55; F2,91=51.81; ηp2=0.36; P=.01), satisfaction (t95=-2.05; F2,91=26.63; ηp2=0.20; P=.04) related to sleep, and mental health outcomes, including depression (t95=2.11; F2,94=29.64; ηp2=0.21; P=.04) and quality of life (t95=-3.13; F2,94=54.20; ηp2=0.33; P=.002), compared to the SHE group after the intervention. The attrition rate in the Somzz group was 12% (6/49). CONCLUSIONS: Somzz outperformed SHE in improving insomnia, mental health, and quality of life. The MCBTi can be a highly accessible, time-efficient, and effective treatment option for chronic insomnia, with high compliance.

10.1016/j.invent.2024.100744,Guided web app intervention for reducing symptoms of depression in postpartum women: Results of a feasibility randomized controlled trial,"Franco P, Olhaberry M, Kelders S, Muzard A, Cuijpers P.",Internet Interv,2024,2024.5.6,,,"BACKGROUND: Chile faces a significant postpartum depression prevalence and treatment gap, necessitating accessible interventions. While cognitive-behavioral internet-based interventions have proven effective in high-income countries, this field is underdeveloped in Chile. Based on the country's widespread use of digital technology, a guided 8-week cognitive-behavioral web app intervention named ""Mamá, te entiendo"" was developed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of ""Mamá, te entiendo"", for reducing depressive symptomatology in postpartum women. METHODS: Sixty-five postpartum women with minor or major depression were randomly assigned to either intervention or waitlist. Primary outcomes centered on study feasibility, intervention feasibility, and acceptability. Semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample enriched the understanding of participants' experiences. Secondary outcomes included mental health variables assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Chilean women displayed great interest in the intervention. 44.8 % of participants completed the intervention. Participants reported high satisfaction and engagement levels, with interviewees highlighting the value of the intervention's content, exercises, and therapist's feedback. However, preliminary efficacy analysis didn't reveal a significant interaction between group and time for outcome measures. DISCUSSION: This research represents a pioneering effort in Chile to evaluate an internet-based intervention for postpartum depression symptoms. The demonstrated feasibility and acceptability highlight the potential of integrating technology-driven approaches into mental health interventions. However, the intervention did not demonstrate superiority, as both groups exhibited similar positive progress in several outcomes. Therefore, the following research phase should involve a larger and more diverse sample to assess the intervention's effectiveness, identify influencing factors, and determine the individuals who benefit the most."
10.1037/ccp0000946,A randomized trial of an app-enhanced group cognitive behavioral therapy for adolescents with mood or psychotic spectrum disorders,"Weintraub MJ, Ichinose MC, Zinberg JL, Salimian A, Brown RD, Morgan-Fleming G, Gamarra JM, Tran T, Miklowitz DJ.",J Consult Clin Psychol,2025,2025.2.27,,,"Objectives: Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for the early stages of mood or psychotic spectrum disorders are difficult to find in public health settings, and the efficacy of these treatments is limited by inconsistent behavioral skill practice among youth between sessions. Treatments can be made more accessible and efficacious when delivered through a group format that makes use of mobile applications to remind users to practice skills. Method: We conducted a 9-week, randomized controlled trial of the unified protocol (UP) for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via telehealth in a group format, comparing an app-enhanced version of the treatment (AppUP) to standard UP for adolescents with mood and psychotic spectrum conditions. The app was designed to help participants review session content, practice treatment skills, and log their psychiatric symptoms. Study assessors evaluated adolescents for psychiatric symptom severity and psychosocial functioning prior to treatment, at posttreatment, and 3 months posttreatment. Results: Sixty adolescents (Mage = 15.0, SD = 1.3) initiated the trial (30 were randomly assigned to each condition) with 49 retained at posttreatment (9 weeks) and 48 retained at 3 months posttreatment. Adolescents in AppUP showed greater improvements in psychosocial functioning over the 5-month study compared with those in standard UP. AppUP was also associated with greater reductions in depression severity among youth with more self-reported skill practice compared to those in standard UP. Conclusions: This study supports the benefits of transdiagnostic CBT for youth with mood and psychotic symptoms. An adjunctive app appears to improve psychosocial functioning and mood among these youth, especially among those who practice behavioral skills regularly.

10.1016/j.invent.2020.100340,An iPad application-based intervention for improving post-stroke depression symptoms in a convalescent rehabilitation ward: A pilot randomized controlled clinical trial protocol,"Uchida H, Hiragaki Y, Nishi Y, Nakahara S, Koumoto J, Onmyoji Y, Fujimoto N, Kawakami K, Ishii M, Hirao K.",Internet Interv,2020,2020.9.18,,,"BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a neuropsychiatric sequela that causes serious adverse effects on the prognosis of stroke patients. Our developed iPad application is a very innovative approach designed to improve participants' depressive symptoms by presenting positive words stimuli in a video. Although this application has fewer side effects than existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and is likely less burdensome for patients and caregivers, its efficacy for PSD has not been investigated. Here we present a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol to investigate the therapeutic potential of this application intervention for PSD patients. METHODS: This study is designed as a 5-week, single-center, open-label, parallel-group, pilot RCT. Thirty-two patients with PSD will be randomly assigned to a combination of the iPad application and usual rehabilitation or usual rehabilitation alone (1:1 allocation ratio). The iPad application intervention lasts 3 min a day, and the usual rehabilitation lasts 3 h a day. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score at the end of the 5-week intervention. DISCUSSION: This pilot RCT is the first study to investigate the potential of iPad application interventions to reduce depressive symptoms in PSD patients. This pilot RCT determines whether this is a viable and effective intervention and informs the design for a full-scale trial. If our hypothesis is correct, this trial can provide evidence to augment the standard practice of iPad application interventions to improve depressive symptoms in patients with PSD."

Correlational evidence has connected sleep and insomnia to resilience; however, this relationship has not yet been experimentally tested. This study examined resilience as a mediator of treatment outcomes in a randomized clinical trial with insomnia patients. METHODS: Participants were randomized to either digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I; n = 358) or sleep education control (n = 300), and assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-year follow-up. A structural equation modeling framework was utilized to test resilience as a mediator of insomnia and depression. Risk for insomnia and depression was also tested in the model, operationalized as a latent factor with sleep reactivity, stress, and rumination as indicators (aligned with the 3-P model). Sensitivity analyses tested the impact of change in resilience on the insomnia relapse and incident depression at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: dCBT-I resulted in greater improvements in resilience compared to the sleep education control. Furthermore, improved resilience following dCBT-I lowered latent risk, which was further associated with reduced insomnia and depression at 1-year follow-up. Sensitivity analyses indicated that each point improvement in resilience following treatment reduced the odds of insomnia relapse and incident depression 1 year later by 76% and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Improved resilience is likely a contributing mechanism to treatment gains following insomnia therapy, which may then reduce longer-term risk for insomnia relapse and depression."

It is important to improve mental health among nurses in these countries. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of two types of newly developed smartphone-based stress management programs in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among hospital nurses in Vietnam. This study was a three-arm (including two intervention groups and one control group) randomized trial. Participants were recruited from nurses in a large general hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. Two types (free-choice and fixed sequential order) of smartphone-based stress management programs were developed. Participants were randomly allocated to Program A (a free-choice, multimodule stress management), Program B (a fixed-order, internet cognitive behavioral therapy, iCBT), or a control group (treatment as usual). The depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales at baseline, 3-, and 7-month follow-up surveys. 951 participants were randomly allocated to each of the three groups. Program B showed a statistically significant effect on improving depressive symptoms at 3-month (p = 0.048), but not at 7-month (p = 0.92); Cohen's d was - 0.18 (95% CI - 0.34 to - 0.02) and 0.03 (95% CI - 1.00 to 1.05), respectively. Program A failed to show a significant intervention effect on any of the outcomes at 3- or 7-month follow-up (p > 0.05). Despite the small effect size, the present fixed-order iCBT program seems effective in improving depression of hospital nurses in Vietnam. A public health impact of the intervention can be scalable, when considering its accessibility and minimal cost.Trial registration number: The study protocol is registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMINCTR; ID = UMIN000033139).

This multisite, randomized trial compared digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a digital pain/SCD education program (""Education"") for managing pain and related symptoms. Participants were recruited virtually from seven SCD centers and community organizations in the United States. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with SCD-related chronic pain and/or daily opioid use were assigned to receive either CBT or Education for 12 weeks. Both groups used an app with interactive chatbot lessons and received personalized health coach support. The primary outcome was the change in pain interference at six months, with secondary outcomes including pain intensity, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Of 453 screened participants, 359 (79%) were randomized to CBT (n = 181) or Education (n = 178); 92% were Black African American, and 66.3% were female. At six months, 250 participants (70%) completed follow-up assessments, with 16 (4%) withdrawals. Engagement with the chatbot varied, with 76% connecting and 48% completing at least one lesson, but 80% of participants completed at least one health coach session. Both groups showed significant within-group improvements in pain interference (CBT: -2.13; Education: -2.66), but no significant difference was observed between them (mean difference, 0.54; P = .57). There were no between-group differences in pain intensity, depression, anxiety, or quality of life. High engagement with health coaching and variable engagement with digital components may explain the similar outcomes between interventions in this diverse, hard-to-reach population."

The addition of psychotherapy to pharmacological management can decrease symptoms, lower relapse rates, and improve quality of life; however, access to psychotherapy is limited. Mental health technologies such as smartphone apps are being studied as a means to increase access to and enhance the effectiveness of adjunctive psychotherapies for bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder find this intervention format acceptable, but our understanding of how people utilize and integrate these tools into their behavior change and maintenance processes remains limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore how individuals with bipolar disorder perceive and utilize a smartphone intervention for health behavior change and maintenance. METHODS: Individuals with bipolar disorder were recruited via flyers placed at university-affiliated and private outpatient mental health practices to participate in a pilot study of LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention. At the end of the study, all participants completed in-depth qualitative exit interviews. The behavior change framework developed to organize the intervention design was used to deductively code behavioral targets and determinants involved in target engagement. Inductive coding was used to identify themes not captured by this framework. RESULTS: In terms of behavioral targets, participants emphasized the importance of managing mood episode-related signs and symptoms. They also discussed the importance of maintaining regular routines, sleep duration, and medication adherence. Participants emphasized that receiving support from a coach as well as seeking and receiving assistance from family, friends, and providers were important for managing behavioral targets and staying well. In terms of determinants, participants stressed the important role of monitoring for their behavior change and maintenance efforts. Monitoring facilitated self-awareness and reflection, which was considered valuable for staying well. Some participants also felt that the intervention facilitated learning information necessary for managing bipolar disorder but others felt that the information provided was too basic. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to addressing acceptability, satisfaction, and engagement, a person-based design of mental health technologies can be used to understand how people experience the impact of these technologies on their behavior change and maintenance efforts. This understanding may then be used to guide ongoing intervention development. The participants' perceptions aligned with the intervention's primary behavioral targets and use of a monitoring tool as a core intervention feature. Participant feedback further indicates that developing additional content and tools to address building and engaging social support may be an important avenue for improving LiveWell. A comprehensive behavior change framework to understand participant perceptions of their behavior change and maintenance efforts may help facilitate ongoing intervention development."

When untreated, these disorders can become long-standing and impair multiple life domains. When compared with all Canadian youth (of different ages), individuals aged between 15 and 25 years are significantly more likely to experience mental health disorders, substance dependencies, and risks for suicidal ideation and death by suicide. Progress in the treatment of youth, capitalizing on their online responsivity, can strategically address depressive disorders. OBJECTIVE: We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare online mindfulness-oriented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-M) combined with standard psychiatric care versus psychiatric care alone in youth diagnosed with major depressive disorder. We will enroll 168 subjects in the age range of 18 to 30 years; 50% of subjects will be from First Nations (FN) backgrounds, whereas the other 50% will be from all other ethnic backgrounds. There will be equal stratification into 2 intervention groups (INT1 and INT2) and 2 wait-list control groups (CTL1 and CTL2) with 42 subjects per group, resulting in an equal number of INT1 and CTL1 of FN background and INT2 and CTL2 of non-FN background. METHODS: The inclusion criteria are: (1) age 18 to 30 years, FN background or other ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II of at least mild severity (BDI-II score ≥14) and no upper limit; (3) Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-confirmed psychiatric diagnosis of major depressive disorder; and (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed by a Centre for Addiction and Mental Health psychiatrist, with diagnoses confirmed using the MINI interview. The exclusion criteria are: (1) individuals receiving weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) individuals who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for severe alcohol/substance use disorder in the past 3 months, or who demonstrate clinically significant suicidal ideation defined as imminent intent, or who have attempted suicide in the past 6 months; and (3) individuals with comorbid diagnoses of borderline personality, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and/or obsessive compulsive disorder. All subjects are provided standard psychiatric care defined as 1 monthly session that focuses on appropriate medication, with session durations of 15 to 30 min. Experimental subjects receive an additional intervention consisting of the CBT-M online software program (in collaboration with Nex J Health, Inc). Exposure to and interaction with the online workbooks are combined with navigation-coaching delivered by phone and secure text message interactions. RESULTS: The outcomes selected, combined with measurement blinding, are key features in assessing whether significant benefits regarding depression and anxiety symptoms occur. CONCLUSIONS: If results confirm the hypothesis that youth can be effectively treated with online CBT-M, effective services may be widely delivered with less geographic restriction.

It is unclear what capability such apps have to facilitate a change in users, particularly in terms of learning key constructs relating to behavioral interventions. Thought Challenger (CBITs, Chicago) is a skill-building app that engages users in cognitive restructuring, a core component of cognitive therapy (CT) for depression. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the learnability and learning performance of users following initial use of Thought Challenger. METHODS: Twenty adults completed in-lab usability testing of Thought Challenger, which comprised two interactions with the app. Learnability was measured via completion times, error rates, and psychologist ratings of user entries in the app; learning performance was measured via a test of CT knowledge and skills. Nonparametric tests were conducted to evaluate the difference between individuals with no or mild depression to those with moderate to severe depression, as well as differences in completion times and pre- and posttests. RESULTS: Across the two interactions, the majority of completion times were found to be acceptable (5 min or less), with minimal errors (1.2%, 10/840) and successful completion of CT thought records. Furthermore, CT knowledge and skills significantly improved after the initial use of Thought Challenger (P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: The learning objectives for Thought Challenger during initial uses were successfully met in an evaluation with likely end users. The findings therefore suggest that apps are capable of providing users with opportunities for learning of intervention skills."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CBT-I modifies negative bias in the perception of emotional facial expressions and whether such changes mediate improvement in depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial of digital CBT-I vs sleep hygiene education was conducted. Adults living in the UK who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 criteria (score ≥10) for depression were recruited online from the community and randomly assigned to either a 6-session digital CBT-I program or a sleep hygiene webpage. Participant recruitment took place between April 26, 2021, and January 24, 2022, and outcomes were assessed at 5 and 10 weeks post randomization. Data analysis was performed from December 1, 2022, to March 1, 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary outcomes were recognition accuracy (percentage) of happy and sad facial expressions at 10 weeks assessed with the facial expression recognition task. Secondary outcomes were self-reported measures of insomnia, depressive symptoms, affect, emotional regulation difficulties, worry, perseverative thinking, midpoint of sleep, social jet lag, and the categorization of and recognition memory for emotional words. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. RESULTS: A total of 205 participants were randomly assigned to CBT-I (n = 101) or sleep hygiene education (n = 104). The sample had a mean (SD) age of 49.3 (10.1) years and was predominately female (165 [80.8%]). Retention was 85.7% (n = 175). At 10 weeks, the estimated adjusted mean difference for recognition accuracy was 3.01 (97.5% CI, -1.67 to 7.69; P = .15; Cohen d = 0.24) for happy facial expressions and -0.54 (97.5% CI, -3.92 to 2.84; P = .72; Cohen d = -0.05) for sad facial expressions. At 10 weeks, CBT-I compared with control decreased insomnia severity (adjusted difference, -4.27; 95% CI, -5.67 to -2.87), depressive symptoms (adjusted difference, -3.91; 95% CI, -5.20 to -2.62), negative affect (adjusted difference, -2.75; 95% CI, -4.58 to -0.92), emotional regulation difficulties (adjusted difference, -5.96; 95% CI, -10.61 to -1.31), worry (adjusted difference, -8.07; 95% CI, -11.81 to -4.33), and perseverative thinking (adjusted difference, -4.21; 95% CI, -7.03 to -1.39) and increased positive affect (adjusted difference, 4.99; 95% CI, 3.13-6.85). Improvement in negative affect, emotional regulation difficulties, and worry at week 5 mediated the effect of CBT-I on depression severity at 10 weeks (% mediated: 21.9% Emotion regulation difficulties; 24.4% Worry; and 29.7% Negative affect). No serious adverse events were reported to the trial team. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial did not find evidence that CBT-I engenders change in the perception of facial expressions at post treatment, despite improvements in insomnia and depressive symptoms. Early change in negative affect, emotional regulation difficulties, and worry mediated lagged depression outcomes and deserve further empirical scrutiny.

Psychological mobile health interventions might be used in follow-up care of breast cancer patients to improve their mental health. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Cochrane and PROSPERO for articles on controlled trials examining the effectiveness of psychological mobile health interventions compared to routine care regarding mental health outcomes of adult breast cancer survivors. This review followed the PRISMA statement and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022312972). Two researchers independently reviewed publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. RESULTS: After screening 204 abstracts published from 2005 to February 2023, eleven randomised trials involving 2249 patients with a mean age between 43.9 and 56.2 years met the inclusion criteria. All interventions used components of cognitive behavioural therapy. Most studies applied self-guided interventions. Five studies reported percentages of patients never started (range = 3-15%) or discontinued the intervention earlier (range = 3-36%). No long-term effect > 3 months post intervention was reported. Three of seven studies reported a significant short-term intervention effect for distress. Only one study each showed an effect for depression (1/5), anxiety (1/5), fear of recurrence (1/4) and self-efficacy (1/3) compared to a control group. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variance of interventions was used. Future studies should follow guidelines in developing and reporting their mobile interventions and conduct long-term follow-up to achieve reliable and comparable results. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: No clear effect of psychological mobile health interventions on patients' mental health could be shown. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO ID 312972."
10.1111/jcpp.12663,Annual Research Review: Digital health interventions for children and young people with mental health problems - a systematic and meta-review,"Hollis C, Falconer CJ, Martin JL, Whittington C, Stockton S, Glazebrook C, Davies EB.",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,2017,2016.12.13,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs), including computer-assisted therapy, smartphone apps and wearable technologies, are heralded as having enormous potential to improve uptake and accessibility, efficiency, clinical effectiveness and personalisation of mental health interventions. It is generally assumed that DHIs will be preferred by children and young people (CYP) given their ubiquitous digital activity. However, it remains uncertain whether: DHIs for CYP are clinically and cost-effective, CYP prefer DHIs to traditional services, DHIs widen access and how they should be evaluated and adopted by mental health services. This review evaluates the evidence-base for DHIs and considers the key research questions and approaches to evaluation and implementation. METHODS: We conducted a meta-review of scoping, narrative, systematic or meta-analytical reviews investigating the effectiveness of DHIs for mental health problems in CYP. We also updated a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DHIs for CYP published in the last 3 years. RESULTS: Twenty-one reviews were included in the meta-review. The findings provide some support for the clinical benefit of DHIs, particularly computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT), for depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults. The systematic review identified 30 new RCTs evaluating DHIs for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, anxiety, depression, psychosis, eating disorders and PTSD. The benefits of DHIs in managing ADHD, autism, psychosis and eating disorders are uncertain, and evidence is lacking regarding the cost-effectiveness of DHIs. CONCLUSIONS: Key methodological limitations make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from existing clinical trials of DHIs. Issues include variable uptake and engagement with DHIs, lack of an agreed typology/taxonomy for DHIs, small sample sizes, lack of blinded outcome assessment, combining different comparators, short-term follow-up and poor specification of the level of human support. Research and practice recommendations are presented that address the key research questions and methodological issues for the evaluation and clinical implementation of DHIs for CYP."

However, little is understood about how and to what extent a digital mental health program can have an impact on the working alliance and clinical outcomes in a blended (therapist plus digital program) cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) intervention for depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the difference in working alliance scores between bCBT and treatment as usual (TAU), examine the association between working alliance and depression severity scores in both arms, and test for an interaction between system usability and working alliance with regard to the association between working alliance and depression scores in bCBT at 3-month assessments. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of the E-COMPARED (European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment versus Treatment-as-usual) trial, which compared bCBT with TAU across 9 European countries. Data were collected in primary care and specialized services between April 2015 and December 2017. Eligible participants aged 18 years or older and diagnosed with major depressive disorder were randomized to either bCBT (n=476) or TAU (n=467). bCBT consisted of 6-20 sessions of bCBT (involving face-to-face sessions with a therapist and an internet-based program). TAU consisted of usual care for depression. The main outcomes were scores of the working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised-Client [WAI-SR-C]) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at 3 months after randomization. Other variables included system usability scores (System Usability Scale-Client [SUS-C]) at 3 months and baseline demographic information. Data from baseline and 3-month assessments were analyzed using linear regression models that adjusted for a set of baseline variables. RESULTS: Of the 945 included participants, 644 (68.2%) were female, and the mean age was 38.96 years (IQR 38). bCBT was associated with higher composite WAI-SR-C scores compared to TAU (B=5.67, 95% CI 4.48-6.86). There was an inverse association between WAI-SR-C and PHQ-9 in bCBT (B=-0.12, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06) and TAU (B=-0.06, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.02), in which as WAI-SR-C scores increased, PHQ-9 scores decreased. Finally, there was a significant interaction between SUS-C and WAI-SR-C with regard to an inverse association between higher WAI-SR-C scores and lower PHQ-9 scores in bCBT (b=-0.030, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01; P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that bCBT may enhance the client working alliance when compared to evidence-based routine care for depression that services reported offering. The working alliance in bCBT was also associated with clinical improvements that appear to be enhanced by good program usability. Our findings add further weight to the view that the addition of internet-delivered CBT to face-to-face CBT may positively augment experiences of the working alliance.

RECENT FINDINGS: Research on CCBT has found solid evidence for efficacy when the use of a therapeutic computer program is supported by a clinician or other helping professionals. Lower levels of efficacy or ineffectiveness typically have been found when computer programs are used as stand-alone treatments. A large number of mobile apps have been created that claim to be useful for depression and/or anxiety. However, considerable caution is warranted in evaluating mobile apps and recommending them to patients. Research on mobile apps is still in an early stage of development. A number of well-established CCBT programs have been studied in multiple randomized, controlled trials and have been found to be effective. Such programs appear to have adequate quality, security, and efficacy to be used in clinical practice. Mobile apps offer easy portability and immediate access to coping strategies and may be useful for augmenting treatment. But clinicians need to select apps with integrity and reliable content for clinical use."
10.3390/healthcare12141435,Effects of Digital Psychotherapy on Suicide: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Oh J, Ho J, Lee S, Park JH.",Healthcare (Basel),2024,2024.7.26,,,"Previous studies reported that digital psychotherapy was a clinically beneficial intervention for suicide ideation. However, the effects of digital psychotherapy on other aspects of suicide beyond ideation remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of digital psychotherapy on suicide and depression. Articles were identified by searching Cochrane, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO in line with the PRISMA statement, yielding nine randomized controlled trials. The difference between conditions regarding suicide and depression in the effect size of the individual article was calculated using Hedges' g. Most digital psychotherapy interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and delivered via apps or the web for at least six weeks. Suicide outcomes primarily focused on suicide ideation. The findings showed digital psychotherapy achieved a significantly larger effect size for suicide (g = 0.488, p < 0.001) and depression (g = 0.316, p < 0.001), compared to controls. Specifically, digital psychotherapy showed a significant effect on both suicide ideation (g = 0.478, p < 0.001) and other suicidal variables (g = 0.330, p < 0.001). These results suggest the effectiveness of digital psychotherapy in reducing suicide and depression compared to traditional face-to-face therapy. Future research should consider a wider range of outcomes and examine the long-term effectiveness of digital psychotherapy to better understand its effects on suicide prevention."

METHODS: In total, 43,842 DMHA referrals for 25,213 unique patients were extracted from the electronic health record of a large, diverse, integrated health system. DMHAs were aggregated by type (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] or mindfulness and meditation [MM]). Monthly referral patterns were described and categorized into mutually exclusive clusters (MM, CBT, or MM and CBT). Multinomial logistic regression and post hoc predicted probabilities were used to profile patient, clinical, and encounter attributes among referral clusters. RESULTS: DMHA referrals increased, reached equilibrium, and then began to decline over the 25-month observation period. Compared with the referral cluster average, MM-alone referrals were more likely to occur for patients who were ages ≥65, who were Hispanic or Asian, whose reason for visit concerned mental health, and who had a primary diagnosis of other anxiety disorders. CBT-alone referrals were more likely to occur for patients with a primary diagnosis of depression and less likely to occur for Hispanic patients. Combined MM and CBT referrals were more likely to occur for patients who were ages 18-30, whose reason for visit was ""other,"" and who had a primary diagnosis of depression and were less likely to occur for Hispanic patients and those ages ≥65. CONCLUSIONS: Although this study demonstrates readiness to integrate DMHA referral into clinical workflows, observed variations in attributes of referral clusters support the need to further investigate provider decision making and whether referral patterns are optimal and sustainable."

A search was conducted on OVID for studies in English from 1966 to 2020. Fifty-nine studies were included. Living through a nuclear disaster is associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Decontamination workers, those living in closest proximity to the reactor, and evacuees experience higher rates of mental health problems after a nuclear disaster. Those with greater psychological resilience and social supports experience lower rates of psychological distress. Individual-level interventions, such as mindfulness training, behavioral activation, and cognitive reappraisal training, have shown modest benefits on improving psychological wellbeing. At the population level, many of the measures in place aimed at reducing exposure to radiation actually increase individuals' anxiety. Technology-based supports have been studied in other types of natural disasters and it may be beneficial to look at mobile-based interventions for future nuclear disasters."
10.1186/s12888-016-0818-5,Effectiveness of blended depression treatment for adults in specialised mental healthcare: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Kemmeren LL, van Schaik DJ, Riper H, Kleiboer AM, Bosmans JE, Smit JH.",BMC Psychiatry,2016,2016.4.23,,,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions are seen as an important potential strategy to improve accessibility and affordability of high quality treatments in mental healthcare. A growing number of studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of internet-based treatment for mood disorders, but scientific evidence for the application in routine specialised mental healthcare settings is limited. Also, little is known about the clinical and health-economic benefits of blended treatment, where online interventions are integrated with face-to-face treatment of depression in one treatment protocol. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (bCBT) for depression, as compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in specialised routine mental healthcare in the Netherlands. This trial is part of the E-COMPARED project which has a broader perspective, focussing on primary and specialised care in eight European countries. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial with two parallel conditions: bCBT and TAU. The blended treatment combines individual face-to-face CBT with CBT delivered through an Internet-based treatment platform (Moodbuster). This platform includes a mobile phone application, used for ecological momentary assessments, automated feedback and motivational messages. Weekly alternating face-to-face (10) and online (9) sessions will be delivered over a period of 19-20 weeks. TAU is defined as the routine care that subjects receive when they are diagnosed with depression in specialised mental healthcare. Adult patients ≥ 18 years old meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder will be recruited within participating outpatient specialised mental healthcare clinics in the Netherlands. Measurements will be taken at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome will be depressive symptoms, measured with the PHQ-9 and QIDS. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, mastery, treatment preference, working alliance, system usability, treatment satisfaction and possible negative side-effects. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect healthcare costs. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the health and economical outcomes of blended treatment for depression and give an indication of the value of implementing blended treatment in specialised clinical settings.

Current recommendations for PPD prevention require intense health care system resources. Evidence-based interventions for PPD prevention that do not further burden the health care system are needed. Evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) can generally reduce depressive symptoms. Technology-based interventions may help decrease common barriers to PA. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report the protocol and provide a data overview of the POstpartum Wellness study (POW)-an effectiveness trial evaluating whether an eHealth PA intervention tailored for postpartum individuals increased PA and decreased depressive symptoms among individuals at high PPD risk. METHODS: This remote parallel-group randomized controlled trial included postpartum individuals with a history of depression or at least moderate current depressive symptoms not meeting the PPD diagnostic threshold and with low PA levels from an integrated health care delivery system. Participants were randomized to an eHealth PA intervention or usual care. The intervention group received access to a library of web-based workout videos designed for postpartum individuals, which included interaction with their infants. At baseline and follow-up (3 and 6 months), PA was measured using questionnaires and a wrist-worn accelerometer. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). Data were collected to assess exploratory outcomes of sleep, perceived stress, anxiety, parent-infant bonding, and infant development. RESULTS: The study was funded in January 2020. Participants were enrolled via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) or telephonically between November 2020 and September 2022; data collection ended in April 2023. Randomized participants (N=99) were 4 months post partum at baseline with moderately severe depressive symptoms (mean PHQ-8 score 12.6, SD 2.2). Intervention (n=50) and usual care (n=49) groups had similar sociodemographic characteristics, months post partum, baseline depressive symptoms, number of children at home, and prepregnancy PA levels. Retention in assessments was ≥66% for questionnaires and ≥48% for accelerometry, with modest differences by group. At 3-month follow-up, 73 of 99 (74%) participants (intervention: 35/50, 70%; usual care: 38/49, 78%) completed questionnaires; 53 of 99 (54%) wore the accelerometer for 7 days (27 of 50 (54%) intervention, 26 of 49 (53%) usual care). At 6-month follow-up, 66 of 99 (67%) participants (30 of 50 (60%) intervention, 36 of 49 (73%) usual care) completed questionnaires and 43 of 99 (43%) wore the accelerometer for 7 days (21 of 50 (42%) intervention, 22 of 49 (45%) usual care). Data analysis is completed, and a manuscript with these findings is currently under review for publication. CONCLUSIONS: The POW trial evaluates the effectiveness of an eHealth PA intervention for improving depressive symptoms and increasing PA among postpartum individuals at high PPD risk. Results have implications for the design and delivery of behavioral interventions among vulnerable patients.

Lifestyle-based mental healthcare offers an additional approach to existing services with potential to help alleviate system burden. Despite the latest Royal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists guidelines recommending that lifestyle is a 'first-line', 'non-negotiable' treatment for mood disorders, few such programs exist within clinical practice. Additionally, there are limited data to determine whether lifestyle approaches are equivalent to established treatments. Using an individually randomised group treatment design, we aim to address this gap by evaluating an integrated lifestyle program (CALM) compared to an established therapy (psychotherapy), both delivered via telehealth. It is hypothesised that the CALM program will not be inferior to psychotherapy with respect to depressive symptoms at 8 weeks. METHODS: The study is being conducted in partnership with Barwon Health's Mental Health, Drugs & Alcohol Service (Geelong, Victoria), from which 184 participants from its service and surrounding regions are being recruited. Eligible participants with elevated psychological distress are being randomised to CALM or psychotherapy. Each takes a trans-diagnostic approach, and comprises four weekly (weeks 1-4) and two fortnightly (weeks 6 and 8) 90-min, group-based sessions delivered via Zoom (digital video conferencing platform). CALM focuses on enhancing knowledge, behavioural skills and support for improving dietary and physical activity behaviours, delivered by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and Accredited Practising Dietitian. Psychotherapy uses cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) delivered by a Psychologist or Clinical Psychologist, and Provisional Psychologist. Data collection occurs at baseline and 8 weeks. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms (assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) at 8 weeks. Societal and healthcare costs will be estimated to determine the cost-effectiveness of the CALM program. A process evaluation will determine its reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance. DISCUSSION: If the CALM program is non-inferior to psychotherapy, this study will provide the first evidence to support lifestyle-based mental healthcare as an additional care model to support individuals experiencing psychological distress.

A potential solution could be nurse-led dCBT-I. This study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of nurse-led dCBT-I in reducing insomnia symptoms and improving mood in adolescents and young adults with depression. AIMS: Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a nurse-led dCBT-I in reducing insomnia severity among adolescents and young adults with depression. METHODS: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial involved 40 adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 24 with major depressive disorder and insomnia. They were assigned to receive either a nurse-led 6-week dCBT-I or usual care. The study evaluated outcomes such as insomnia severity, depression severity, and sleep parameters. Measurements were taken at baseline, immediately after the intervention (6 weeks), and during a follow-up at 18 weeks. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Results indicated that, compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group exhibited a significant reduction in insomnia severity at the 18-week follow-up, with a large effect size (Cohen's d = -0.965, p < 0.001). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease in depression severity both at the end of the intervention (Cohen's d = -0.686, p = 0.001) and at the 18-week follow-up (Cohen's d = -0.508, p = 0.011), indicating a medium effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led dCBT-I is an effective treatment for adolescents and young adults with depression and insomnia."

This behavior has been related to positive (eg, future planning, problem solving) and negative (eg, unhappiness, impaired cognitive performance) outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Based on previous research suggesting future-oriented (ie, prospective) mind wandering may support autobiographical planning and self-regulation, this study examined associations between hourly mind wandering and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and the impact of affect and daily sleep on these relations. METHODS: College-aged adults (N=33) participated in a mobile phone-delivered ecological momentary assessment study for 1 week. Sixteen hourly prompts assessing mind wandering and affect were delivered daily via participants' mobile phones. Perceived sleep quality and duration was assessed during the first prompt each day, and participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer during waking hours throughout the study week. RESULTS: Study findings suggest present-moment mind wandering was positively associated with future MVPA (P=.03), and this relationship was moderated by affective state (P=.04). Moreover, excessive sleep the previous evening was related to less MVPA across the following day (P=.007). Further, mind wandering was positively related to activity only among those who did not oversleep (P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results have implications for multiple health behavior interventions targeting physical activity, affect, and sleep. Researchers may also build on this work by studying these relationships in the context of other important behaviors and psychosocial factors (eg, tobacco use, depression, loneliness)."

As an adjunct to such internet-based CBT (ICBT) approaches, text messaging has been associated with increased adherence and therapeutic alliance. OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed data from the intervention arm of a randomized control trial evaluating 24-week ICBT for MDD (intervention arm) against standard-care psychiatry (waitlist control). The aim of this secondary analysis was to assess MDD symptom improvement in relation to the frequency and content of text messages sent by ICBT participants to Navigator-Coaches during randomized control trial participation. Higher text frequency in general and in 3 conceptual categories (appreciating alliance, alliance building disclosures, and agreement confirmation) was hypothesized to predict larger MDD symptom improvement. METHODS: Participants were young adults (18-30 years) from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. The frequencies of categorized texts from 20 ICBT completers were analyzed with respect to MDD symptom improvement using linear regression models. Texts were coded by 2 independent coders and categorized using content analysis. MDD symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). RESULTS: Participants sent an average of 136 text messages. Analyses indicated that BDI-II improvement was negatively associated with text messaging frequency in general (β=-0.029, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.048) and in each of the 3 categories: appreciating alliance (β=-0.096, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.61), alliance building disclosures (β=-0.098, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.084), and agreement confirmation (β=-0.076, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.25). Altogether, the effect of text messaging on BDI-II improvement was uniformly negative across statistical models. More text messaging appeared associated with less MDD symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesized positive associations between conceptually categorized text messages and MDD symptom improvement were not supported in this study. Instead, more text messaging appeared to indicate less treatment benefit. Future studies with larger samples are needed to discern the optimal use of text messaging in ICBT approaches using adjunctive modes of communication.

The majority of people suffer from severe sleep disorders after a traumatic event. Because sleep is essential for processing emotional memories, we aim to improve sleep quality in acutely traumatized patients to benefit adaptive trauma processing and thereby prevent PTSD development.Objective: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will investigate whether digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) has the potential to not only increase sleep quality in acutely traumatized individuals but also reduce trauma-related symptoms (specific PTSD symptoms as well as related symptoms such as depression, anxiety and functional outcomes) and the risk for PTSD development in acutely traumatized individuals. Moreover, we will test if sleep disturbances pre-therapy predict the development of later PTSD symptoms.Method: We aim to recruit 104 patients who will be randomly assigned to an app-based sleep intervention utilizing CBT-I or a sleep diary as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in outpatient acute trauma centres. Sleep quality, PTSD symptoms and everyday functioning will be measured before, after the intervention and at a 6-month follow-up.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this multicentre RCT is the first study to use dCBT-I as an early intervention for trauma. It may improve the understanding of the role of sleep in the development of PTSD and has the potential to contribute to the development of an easy-to-use early intervention for acutely traumatized individuals. Plain Language Summary: Sleep disturbances are common after traumatic events and could contribute to the processing of the traumatic event being disturbed.This study will increase our understanding of the role of sleep in PTSD development.The investigated approach has the potential to open up new possibilities for PTSD prevention. Antecedentes: Existe una gran necesidad de intervenciones factibles en el periodo inicial después de un trauma que minimicen el riesgo de desarrollar un TEPT clínicamente relevante. La mayoría de las personas sufren de trastornos del sueño graves después de un evento traumático. Debido a que dormir es esencial para el procesamiento de los recuerdos emocionales, buscamos mejorar la calidad del sueño en pacientes con trauma agudo para beneficiar el procesamiento del trauma en forma adaptativa y así prevenir el desarrollo del TEPT. Objetivo: En un ensayo controlado aleatorizado multicéntrico (RCT por sus siglas en inglés) investigaremos si la terapia cognitivo conductual digital para el insomnio (dCBT-I por sus siglas en inglés) tiene el potencial de no solo mejorar la calidad del sueño en personas con trauma agudo si no también reducir los síntomas relacionados con el trauma (síntomas específicos de TEPT así como también síntomas relacionados tales como depresión, ansiedad y consecuencias funcionales) y el riesgo de desarrollar TEPT en individuos con trauma agudo. Además, probaremos si los problemas del sueño previos a la terapia predicen el desarrollo de síntomas de TEPT a posteriori. Método: Nuestro objetivo es reclutar 104 pacientes que serán asignados en forma aleatoria a una intervención para el sueño basado en una aplicación utilizando CBT-I o un diario del sueño como un complemento al tratamiento habitual (TAU por sus siglas en inglés) en un centro ambulatorio para pacientes con trauma agudo. La calidad del sueño, los síntomas de TEPT y el funcionamiento diario serán medidos antes, después de la intervención y al seguimiento 6 meses después. Conclusiones: A nuestro entender, este RCT multicéntrico es el primer estudio en usar dCBT-I como una intervención temprana para trauma. Éste puede mejorar la comprensión del papel del sueño en el desarrollo del TEPT y tiene el potencial de contribuir al desarrollo de una intervención temprana fácil de usar para personas con trauma agudo."

AIM: The aim of this review was to examine the effectiveness of technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms in women suffering from or at risk of experiencing perinatal depression. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched until February 2023 for articles published in English. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics and Cochran's Q chi-squared test. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed, and quality appraisals at the study and outcome levels were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 16 randomized controlled trials were included in the review. Results from meta-analyses suggest that technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy has a medium effect in reducing perinatal depressive symptoms and a small effect in reducing perinatal anxiety symptoms. Overall, women suffering from or at risk of perinatal depression may benefit from technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Future interventions can be improved by addressing both perinatal depression and anxiety, paying more attention to antenatal women to prevent postnatal mental health issues, and using self-guided mobile applications for accessibility."

Objective: The present study will evaluate the non-inferiority, cost-effectiveness, and safety of two versions of integrated blended psychotherapy for depression and anxiety compared to standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods: A three-armed multicenter cluster-randomized controlled non-inferiority trial will be conducted comparing two implementations of blended psychotherapy (PSYCHOnlineTHERAPYfix/flex) compared to CBT. Seventy-five outpatient psychotherapists with a CBT-license will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each of them is asked to include 12 patients on average with depressive or anxiety disorders resulting in a total sample size of N = 900. All patients receive up to a maximum of 16 psychotherapy sessions, either as routine CBT or alternating with Online self-help sessions (fix: 8/8; flex: 0-16). Assessments will be conducted at patient study inclusion (pre-treatment) and 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks and 12 months post-inclusion. The primary outcome is depression and anxiety severity at 18 weeks post-inclusion (post-treatment) using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes are depression and anxiety remission, treatment response, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, working alliance, psychotherapy adherence, and patient safety. Additionally, several potential moderators and mediators including patient characteristics and attitudes toward the interventions will be examined, complemented by ecological day-to-day digital behavior variables via passive smartphone sensing as part of an integrated smart-sensing sub-study. Data-analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis with additional per-protocol analyses. In addition, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted from a societal and a public health care perspective. Additionally, qualitative interviews on acceptance, feasibility, and optimization potential will be conducted and analyzed. Discussion: PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY will provide evidence on blended psychotherapy in one of the largest ever conducted psychotherapy trials. If shown to be non-inferior and cost-effective, PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY has the potential to innovate psychotherapy in the near future by extending the ways of conducting psychotherapy.

10.2196/27410,Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: Implementation Cost-Effectiveness Study,"Piera-Jiménez J, Etzelmueller A, Kolovos S, Folkvord F, Lupiáñez-Villanueva F.",J Med Internet Res,2021,2021.5.11,,,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a chronic condition; its prevalence is expected to grow with the aging trend of high-income countries. Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy has proven efficacy in treating major depressive disorder. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a community internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (Super@, the Spanish program for the MasterMind project) for treating major depressive disorder. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the Super@ program was assessed with the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing tool, using a 3-state Markov model. Data from the cost and effectiveness of the intervention were prospectively collected from the implementation of the program by a health care provider in Badalona, Spain; the corresponding data for usual care were gathered from the literature. The health states, transition probabilities, and utilities were computed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. RESULTS: The analysis was performed using data from 229 participants using the Super@ program. Results showed that the intervention was more costly than usual care; the discounted (3%) and nondiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were €29,367 and €26,484 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively (approximately US $35,299 and $31,833, respectively). The intervention was cost-effective based on the €30,000 willingness-to-pay threshold typically applied in Spain (equivalent to approximately $36,060). According to the deterministic sensitivity analyses, the potential reduction of costs associated with intervention scale-up would reduce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention, although it remained more costly than usual care. A discount in the incremental effects up to 5% exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000. CONCLUSIONS: The Super@ program, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for treating major depressive disorder, cost more than treatment as usual. Nevertheless, its implementation in Spain would be cost-effective from health care and societal perspectives, given the willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 compared with treatment as usual."

METHODS: Adults aged 50 or older with at least mild depressive symptoms were recruited from multiple resources. A random subset of participants was invited for a semi-structured qualitative interview during a post-intervention assessment conducted over the phone (N = 148). Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded in a multi-phase, team-based approach utilizing inductive coding techniques, followed by thematic analysis to identify key themes. RESULTS: Six key themes regarding engagement emerged: the importance of a structured, skills-based, and self-paced approach; the essential role of weekly coaching for accountability, web interface's ease of use and accessibility; narrative engagement dynamics; enhanced learning through multimodal instruction; and tailoring challenges in iCBT. CONCLUSIONS: Older adult-centered, layperson-supported, and multimodal iCBT can effectively engage older adults in managing their mental health. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: iCBT programs can be integrated into various community aging settings. By leveraging each setting's strengths and involving a range of professionals, these programs can play an important role in enhancing older adults' mental health."

Barriers to help-seeking include shame, feared loss of autonomy and negative attitudes towards healthcare providers. The use of mobile devices and apps continues to rise amongst young people, thus presenting opportunities to utilize these aids in overcoming help-seeking barriers. Apps have been shown to assist in several health-related areas, including weight loss and smoking cessation, although no apps have as yet been evaluated for suicide prevention. Moreover, there is a lack of research that scientifically evaluates suicide prevention interventions within Indigenous communities. METHODS/DESIGN: In this study, a recently developed self-help app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention is based on acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy. It is aimed at participants who have suicidal thoughts but who are not actively suicidal. In total, 150 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 75) or to the wait-list control condition (N = 75). Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, post-test and 6 weeks follow-up. The primary outcome measure is a reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of depression, anxiety and impulsivity. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help app for suicidal thoughts amongst young Indigenous people. Several limitations and strengths of the design are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12613000104752."
10.1111/jep.70022,Evaluation of a Trial of Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Programme Within Local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,Bell D.,J Eval Clin Pract,2025,2025.2.11,,,"RATIONALE: NICE guidelines recommend offering computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (cCBT) to young people with mild mental health issues to ensure early treatment access and reduce service demand. Emerging evidence suggests cCBT reduces symptoms, but further evaluation is needed. SilverCloud is a recommended digital CBT programme. AIMS: Evaluate a pilot trial of SilverCloud in CAMHS at a local NHS Foundation Trust. OBJECTIVES: (1) Symptomology: Is there a change in depression or anxiety symptoms after using the intervention? (measured by outcome scores); (2) Adoption: What was young people's engagement with SilverCloud? (measured by time spent on the platform and uptake); (3) Satisfaction: How satisfied were young people with SilverCloud? (measured by module feedback ratings and a questionnaire). METHODS: The SilverCloud intervention for young people was evaluated over 9 months. Reductions in symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and low mood were measured using the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), GAD, and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) subscales. Adoption was measured by time spent on SilverCloud and intervention uptake. Satisfaction was measured by module feedback ratings and a questionnaire. RESULTS: Ninety-one people were offered SilverCloud, 77% started, 46% completed it and 27% disengaged. Thirty-two participants completed SilverCloud during the evaluation (12 CYP and 20 parents). No statistically significant reduction was found in any subscale. Satisfaction was varied; 94% rated the intervention favourably, but no participants reported behaviour changes due to the intervention. CONCLUSION: This evaluation suggests tentative pessimism regarding SilverCloud's benefits. However, due to significant challenges and limitations, further analysis is recommended. Recommendations were given for local services."

METHOD: Two-hundred participants with recurrent elevated binge-eating symptoms and a higher body weight were enrolled in a remote parallel-group randomized trial, of which 142 completed the initial assessment (70 in the intervention group). The end-of-treatment and follow-up assessments were conducted 12 weeks after the initial assessment and 26 weeks after the end of treatment, respectively. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyzes were undertaken using frequentist linear mixed models and Bayesian hierarchical models to test the intervention effectiveness. RESULTS: 43 (waitlist control) and 29 (intervention) participants completed the end-of-treatment assessment, showing a high attrition rate (51%). ITT analyzes showed the eBEfree program to be associated with a significant reduction in binge eating symptomatology from baseline to end-of-treatment (β = -9.49, ρ < 0.0001, g = -1.17), and from end-of-treatment to 26-weeks follow-up (β = -6.01, ρ = 0.04, g = -1.08). At end-of-treatment, the intervention was also associated with a decrease in body mass index and depression symptomatology, as well as an improvement in dimensions of self-criticism and mindfulness. More than 80% of participants rated the quality of the program as positive and helpful. DISCUSSION: This trial suggests potential benefits of the eBEfree program to help individuals manage symptoms of binge-eating more effectively, reduce weight, and improve well-being and mental health. The intervention benefits should be confirmed in future larger trials. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Treating binge-eating (BE) symptoms and associated comorbidities might be challenging for mental health services. Digital and app-based interventions can be a valuable resource to help people manage symptoms and improve well-being and mental health. The current trial suggests the potential benefits of an app-based intervention (eBEfree program) to help people reduce BE symptoms and develop psychological strategies to promote well-being and mental health.

10.2196/37640,Appropriate Use and Operationalization of Adherence to Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety in Youth: Systematic Review,"Li SH, Achilles MR, Werner-Seidler A, Beames JR, Subotic-Kerry M, O'Dea B.",JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022.8.17,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital, self-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions circumvent many barriers to in-person therapy for young people (aged 12-24 years), although adherence to these interventions is low. The absence or insufficient disclosure of recommendations or instructions for appropriate use may account for this. As such, many young people may not self-administer these interventions appropriately or receive the optimal degree of treatment. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on digital CBT for depression and anxiety in young people to describe how appropriate use has been defined and communicated to users as instructions for use, to describe how adherence has been measured, and to determine the associations between adherence and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted with 2 reviewers (SHL and MRA) extracting data independently. Overall, 4 electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched in April 2021 for studies that met the following inclusion criteria: participants aged between 12 and 24 years, evaluated a digital CBT intervention targeting depression or anxiety, and reported instructions or recommendations for use or measures of adherence. Studies that evaluated non-CBT interventions or cognitive- or behavioral-only interventions were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study Designs. RESULTS: There were 32 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria, of which 28 (88%) were unique studies (N=16,578 youths). Definitions of appropriate use varied among the different interventions in terms of intended recipients, duration and frequency of use, and the features used to support engagement and adherence to appropriate use definitions. Reporting of appropriate use definitions in studies was inconsistent, with no study systematically describing components of appropriate use or providing information on how recommendations for use were relayed to users. Most often, definitions of appropriate use were derived from the study protocol and descriptions of intervention features. Adherence was mostly operationalized as the degree of intervention completion; however, reporting of adherence data was heterogeneous. There was little evidence of an association between degree of use and outcomes in the 9 studies that examined this. CONCLUSIONS: Definitions of appropriate use are unique to each digital CBT intervention. However, statements of appropriate use are not systematically reported in the literature. Furthermore, the extent to which recommendations for use are communicated to users is not routinely reported. Despite unique definitions of appropriate use, adherence was most often generically operationalized as the degree of intervention completion and was not consistently associated with outcomes. We proposed a framework to promote systematic reporting of definitions of appropriate use for digital interventions to provide guidance to users and to assist the development of appropriate and nuanced measures of adherence.

We describe the development and pilot testing of a self-help intervention for depression, PUSH-D (Practice and Use Self-Help for Depression) for urban Indians. This guided self-help app, with essential and optional zone sections, was developed to provide a comprehensive coverage of therapeutic strategies drawn from cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal therapy, supportive psychotherapy, and positive psychology. Pilot testing was carried out using a single group pre-, post- and follow-up design in 78 eligible participants. Participants were typically young adults with major depression or dysthymia and significant impairment in functioning. Almost two-thirds of the participants had never sought professional mental health help. Significant reductions in depression and improvement in the functioning and well-being were notedon standardized measures in participants completing all 10 essential zone sections. These gains were maintained at follow-up. The results were similar for partial completers, who completed fiveout of the 10 essential sections. PUSH-D is one of the first indigenously developed self-help apps for depression and it shows promise in reducing the treatment gap for depression in India."

However, little is known about the efficacy of such interventions when delivered to employee groups. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a digital mental health platform for the workplace, which incorporates evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. A total of 3 brief, unguided interventions designed to address stress, anxiety, and resilience, respectively, are evaluated. The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the study methods and interventions in preparation for a definitive randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The study used a fully remote, parallel, multi-arm, external pilot randomized controlled trial, with 3 intervention arms and a no-intervention control group. Participants were working adults representative of the general UK population with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity who were recruited from a web-based participant platform. Primary outcomes included objective and self-report measures of feasibility, acceptability, engagement, transferability, relevance, and negative effects. Secondary outcomes included 4 self-report measures of mental health and well-being, completed at baseline (time point 0 [t0]), postintervention (time point 1 [t1]), and the 1-month follow-up (time point 2 [t2]). Secondary outcomes were analyzed via linear mixed-effects models using intention-to-treat principles. Preregistered criteria for progression to a definitive trial were evaluated. RESULTS: Data were collected between January and March of 2021. A total of 383 working adult participants meeting trial eligibility were randomized, of whom 356 (93%) were retained at t2. Objective engagement data showed that 67.8% (196/289) of participants randomized to an intervention arm completed their intervention. Overall, 87.1% (203/233) of participants reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their intervention and rated the quality of their intervention as good or excellent. All intervention groups reported significantly greater improvements than the control group on at least one secondary outcome at t1, with between-group Hedges g effect sizes for the pooled interventions ranging from 0.25 (95% CI 0.05-0.46) to 0.43 (95% CI 0.23-0.64). All the improvements were maintained at t2. CONCLUSIONS: The study methods were feasible, and all preregistered criteria for progression to a definitive trial were met. Several minor protocol amendments were noted. Preliminary efficacy findings suggest that the study interventions may result in improved mental health outcomes when offered to working adults.

CBT is an effective treatment for IBS. Self-help CBT apps can increase accessibility but should be tested against active controls. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (NCT04665271) compared a CBT for IBS self-help app (Zemedy) to an active education, lifestyle management, relaxation, and mindfulness control app. A total of 453 individuals were screened in and offered allocation to treatment. Participants who actually downloaded their assigned app (N=267) were evenly split between the CBT app (N=136) and the active control (N=131). Follow-up data (CBT N=74, control N=82) were collected immediately post-treatment, at which point the control group was offered crossover to CBT. Follow-up data were collected at 3 (N=65) and 6 (N=32) months. Primary outcomes included IBS symptom severity and IBS quality of life. Secondary outcomes included catastrophizing, visceral anxiety, fear of food, and depression. RESULTS: At post-treatment, the CBT group improved significantly across all outcomes. The control group also improved on all outcomes except fear of food. In the intent-to-treat analysis the CBT group improved significantly more than the control group on both primary and secondary outcomes except depression. Gains were maintained at 3 and 6 months, although attrition was considerable. CONCLUSION: Self-help CBT for IBS may be effective and can be delivered successfully through apps, although we did not have data on engagement. Psychoeducation about symptom management strategies, relaxation, and mindfulness are active treatment components, but CBT is better at addressing underlying maintaining factors like catastrophizing, visceral anxiety, and fear of food."

This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of an internet-based cognitive-behavioral (iCBT) depression intervention for people with CAD and depressive symptoms. METHODS: People with CAD and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) were randomly assigned to the eight modules comprising iCBT (N = 18), or waitlist-control (N = 16). Measures were taken at baseline (t1) and at post-treatment (eight weeks after randomization, t2). Feasibility-related outcomes were recruitment strategy, study attrition, intervention dropout, satisfaction, negative effects as well as the potential of the intervention to affect likely outcomes in a future full-scale trial (depression, anxiety, quality of life, fear of progression). Data analyses were based on intention-to-treat principles. Linear regression models were used to detect between group differences. Linear Mixed Models were used to model potential changes over time. RESULTS: This trial was terminated prior to a-priori defined sample size has been reached given low recruitment success as well as high intervention dropout (88%) and study attrition (23%). On average, participants in the intervention group completed M = 2.78 (SD = 3.23) modules. Participants in the waitlist control group barely started one module (M = 0.82, SD = 1.81). The satisfaction with the intervention was low (M = 20.6, SD = 0.88). Participants reported no negative effects attributed to the iCBT. Differences between groups with regard to depression, anxiety, fear of progression and quality of life remained non-significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This trial failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants. Future work should explore potential pitfalls with regards to the reach and persuasiveness of internet interventions for people living with CAD. The study gives important indications for future studies with regard to the need for new ideas to reach and treat people with CAD and depression."

Computer- and Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (cCBT) may be an attractive treatment alternative to regular face-to-face treatment.This meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether cCBT is effective for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases (Pubmed, Cochrane controlled trial register, PsychInfo) up to December 4, 2013. Only randomized controlled trials in which a computer-, Internet- or mobile-based cognitive behavioral intervention targeting either depression, anxiety or both in children or adolescents up to the age of 25 were compared to a control condition were selected. We employed a random-effects pooling model in overall effect analyses and a mixed effect model for sub-group analyses. Searches resulted in identifying 13 randomized trials, including 796 children and adolescents that met inclusion criteria. Seven studies were directed at treating anxiety, four studies at depression, and two were of a transdiagnostic nature, targeting both anxiety and depression. The overall mean effect size (Hedges' g) of cCBT on symptoms of anxiety or depression at post-test was g=0.72 (95% CI:0.55-0.90, numbers needed to be treated (NNT)=2.56). Heterogeneity was low (I²=20.14%, 95% CI: 0-58%). The superiority of cCBT over controls was evident for interventions targeting anxiety (g=0.68; 95% CI: 0.45-0.92; p < .001; NNT=2.70) and for interventions targeting depression (g=0.76; 95% CI: 0.41-0.12; p < .001; NNT=2.44) as well as for transdiagnostic interventions (g=0.94; 95% CI: 0.23-2.66; p < .001; NNT=2.60). CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the efficacy of cCBT in the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth. Hence, such interventions may be a promising treatment alternative when evidence based face-to-face treatment is not feasible. Future studies should examine long-term effects of treatments and should focus on obtaining patient-level data from existing studies, to perform an individual patient data meta-analysis."

Digital intelligence interventions overcome the limitations of conventional psychotherapy and offer new treatments for depression and anxiety. However, the effectiveness among older adults remains unclear. METHODS: Databases including Pubmed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) from inception to November 22, 2023. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 18.0 and Review Manager 5.4. RESULTS: The initial search found 9369 papers, with 21 meeting the inclusion criteria (e.g., RCTs involving older adults aged 50 and older that assessed digital intelligence interventions on depression and anxiety symptoms). Meta-analyses revealed that, compared to control groups, digital intelligence interventions significantly reduced depression symptoms (SMD: -0.58; 95 % CI: -0.80, -0.35) and anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.39; 95 % CI: -0.58, -0.19). Subgroup analysis revealed that internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT), interventions lasting 7 to 10 weeks, and the use of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales, especially in other regions, had the most pronounced effects. CONCLUSIONS: Digital intelligence interventions reduce depressive and anxious symptoms in older adults, supporting the development of evidence-based treatment guidelines in the digital era."

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the early stages of such a process, illustrated by the methodology for the ongoing development of a behavioral intervention technology targeting generalized anxiety disorder and major depression among young sexual minority men. METHODS: We integrated instructional design for Internet behavioral intervention technologies with greater detail on information sources that can identify user needs in understudied populations, as well as advances in the understanding of technology-specific behavioral intervention technology dimensions that may need to be culturally tailored. RESULTS: General psychological theory describing how to effect change in the clinical target is first integrated with theory describing potentially malleable factors that help explain the clinical problem within the population. Additional information sources are then used to (1) evaluate the theory, (2) identify population-specific factors that may affect users' ability to relate to and benefit from the behavioral intervention technology, and (3) establish specific skills, attitudes, knowledge, etc, required to change malleable factors posited in the theory. User needs result from synthesis of this information. Product requirements are then generated through application of the user needs to specific behavioral intervention technology dimensions (eg, technology platform). We provide examples of considerations relevant to each stage of this process and how they were applied. CONCLUSIONS: This process can guide the initial design of other culturally informed behavioral intervention technologies. This first attempt to create a systematic design process can spur development of guidelines for design of behavioral intervention technologies aimed to reduce health disparities."

Web-based interventions represent an alternative treatment option for men, are effective in reducing anxiety and depression, and have potential for wide dissemination. However, men do not access Web-based programs at the same rate as women. Programs with content explicitly tailored to men's mental health needs are required. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the applicability of Man Central, a new Web and mobile phone intervention for men with depression. The impact of the use of Man Central on depression, resilience, and work and social functioning was assessed. METHODS: A recruitment flier was distributed via social media, email networks, newsletters, research registers, and partner organizations. A single-group, repeated measures design was used. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression. Secondary outcomes included externalizing symptoms, resilience, and work and social functioning. Man Central comprises regular mood, symptom, and behavior monitoring, combined with three 15-min interactive sessions. Clinical features are grounded in cognitive behavior therapy and problem-solving therapy. A distinguishing feature is the incorporation of positive strategies identified by men as useful in preventing and managing depression. Participants were directed to use Man Central for a period of 4 weeks. Linear mixed modeling with intention-to-treat analysis assessed associations between the intervention and the primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 144 men aged between 18 and 68 years and with at least mild depression enrolled in the study. The symptoms most often monitored by men included motivation (471 instances), depression (399), sleep (323), anxiety (316), and stress (262). Reminders were scheduled by 60.4% (87/144). Significant improvements were observed in depression symptoms (P<.001, d=0.68), depression risk, and externalizing symptoms (P<.001, d=0.88) and work and social functioning (P<.001, d=0.78). No change was observed in measures of resilience. Participants reported satisfaction with the program, with a majority saying that it was easy (42/51, 82%) and convenient (41/51, 80%) to use. Study attrition was high; 27.1% (39/144) and 8.3% (12/144) of the participants provided complete follow-up data and partial follow-up data, respectively, whereas the majority (93/144, 64.6%) did not complete follow-up measures. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary evaluation demonstrated the potential of using electronic health (eHealth) tools to deliver self-management strategies to men with depressive symptoms. Man Central may meet the treatment needs of a subgroup of depressed men who are willing to engage with an e-mental health program. With further research, it may provide an acceptable option to those unwilling or unable to access traditional mental health services. Given the limitations of the study design, prospective studies are required, using controlled designs to further elucidate the effect of the program over time."

Women typically carry a disproportionate share of the psychological burden associated with infertility, experiencing poor quality of life, and 30%-40% experiencing depressive mood or anxiety. Unfortunately, currently available psychological interventions targeting infertility-related distress are associated with modest effects. OBJECTIVE: Our team, in collaboration with patient advisors, has designed a self-help intervention for infertility-related distress involving 7 weekly 10-minute videos addressing the cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal challenges associated with infertility, delivered through a mobile app. A feasibility study suggests that it is well accepted and highly effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depressed mood among distressed individuals dealing with infertility. This study represents the next step in this line of research: a fully powered randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention to a waitlist control group. METHODS: We will recruit 170 individuals struggling to become pregnant in Canada or the United States to be randomized to our 7-week self-help program or a treatment-as-usual condition. The primary outcome will be fertility quality of life, while secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, and relationship quality, assessed before and after the program as well as biweekly for 16 weeks following completion of the program. Self-reported health care use and the presence of diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, assessed through a structured psychiatric interview, will also be assessed immediately following the intervention and at the 16-week follow-up assessment. Treatment adherence and retention will also be recorded throughout the intervention. Multilevel modeling will compare the intervention arm to the treatment-as-usual condition in terms of all continuous outcomes across the 9 measurement points. Logistic regression will be used to assess the occurrence of mood and anxiety disorders in the 2 treatment arms at the posttreatment assessment as well as at the 16-week follow-up. Sensitivity analyses will examine potential treatment moderators: membership in the LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual) communities, baseline fertility quality of life, cultural background, disability status, and pursuit of conception through medical intervention. RESULTS: We expect our intervention to be more effective than treatment-as-usual in improving all mental health parameters assessed and decreasing health care use related to both mental and reproductive health. Effects are expected to be larger with decreasing baseline quality of life and equally effective regardless of membership in the LGBTQIA+ communities, cultural background, or disability status. CONCLUSIONS: If our intervention is successful, this would suggest that it should be scaled up and made publicly available. The availability of this program would fill an important gap in light of the high rates of psychopathology among those experiencing infertility and considering the current lack of effective psychotherapy approaches for infertility.

10.1093/sleep/zsz150,Depression prevention via digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: a randomized controlled trial,"Cheng P, Kalmbach DA, Tallent G, Joseph CL, Espie CA, Drake CL.",Sleep,2019,2019.9.20,,,"Comment in Sleep. 2020 Nov 12;43(11):zsaa153. doi: 10.1093/sleep/zsaa153. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is a common precursor to depression; yet, the potential for insomnia treatment to prevent depression has not been demonstrated. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effectively reduces concurrent symptoms of insomnia and depression and can be delivered digitally (dCBT-I); however, it remains unclear whether treating insomnia leads to sustained reduction and prevention of depression. This randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of dCBT-I in reducing and preventing depression over a 1-year follow-up period. METHODS: Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to receive dCBT-I or an attentional control. The follow-up sample included 358 patients in the dCBT-I condition and 300 patients in the online sleep education condition. The primary outcome measure was relative rate ratios for depression at 1-year follow-up. Insomnia responses to treatment were also tested as predictors of incident depression at the 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, depression severity continued to be significantly lower in the dCBT-I condition relative to control. In addition, the number of individuals who reported no depression at 1-year follow-up was 51% higher in the dCBT-I condition relative to control. In those with minimal to no depression at baseline, the incident rate of moderate-to-severe depression at 1-year follow-up was reduced by half in the dCBT-I condition relative to the control condition. CONCLUSION: dCBT-I showed robust effects as an intervention that prevents depression. Future research should examine dose-response requirements and further characterize mechanisms of action of dCBT-I for depression prevention.

10.1186/s40359-023-01312-1,StudiCare procrastination - Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial of a persuasive design-optimized internet- and mobile-based intervention with digital coach targeting procrastination in college students,"Mutter A, Küchler AM, Idrees AR, Kählke F, Terhorst Y, Baumeister H.",BMC Psychol,2023,2023.9.12,,,"BACKGROUND: Academic procrastination is widespread among college students. Procrastination is strongly negatively correlated with psychological well-being, thus early interventions are needed. Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) could provide a low-threshold treatment option. Human guidance seems to be a decisive mechanism of change in iCBT. Persuasive design optimization of iCBT and guidance by a digital coach might represent a resource-saving alternative. The study evaluated the non-inferiority of a digital coach in comparison to human guidance with regard to the primary outcome procrastination. METHODS: The iCBT StudiCare procrastination was optimized by principles of the Persuasive System Design (PSD). A total of 233 college students were randomly assigned to either StudiCare procrastination guided by a digital coach (intervention group, IG) or by a human eCoach (control group, CG). All participants were assessed at baseline, 4-, 8- and 12-weeks post-randomization. Symptom change and between-group differences were assessed with latent growth curve models and supported by effect size levels. The non-inferiority margin was set at Cohen's d = - 0.3. RESULTS: The primary outcome procrastination measured by the Irrational Procrastination scale (IPS) significantly decreased across groups (γ = - 0.79, p < .001, Cohen's d = -0.43 to -0.89) from baseline to 12-weeks post-randomization. There were no significant differences between groups (γ = -0.03, p = .84, Cohen's d = -0.03 to 0.08). Regarding symptoms of depression, no significant time x group effect was found (γ = 0.26, p = .09; Cohen's d = -0.15 to 0.21). There was also no significant time x group effect on the improvement of symptoms of anxiety (γ = 0.25, p = .09). However, Cohen's ds were above the non-inferiority margin 8-weeks (Cohen's d = 0.51) and 12-weeks post-randomization (Cohen's d = 0.37), preferring the CG. Of the IG, 34% and of the CG, 36% completed 80% of the modules. CONCLUSIONS: The PSD optimized version of StudiCare procrastination is effective in reducing procrastination. The digital coach was not inferior to human guidance. Guidance by a digital coach in iCBT against procrastination for college students could be a resource-saving alternative to human guidance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Trial Register (ID: DRKS00025209, 30/04/2021)."
10.1186/s13063-022-06728-5,Internet-based cognitive therapy for women with antenatal depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for a multi-center randomized controlled trial across China,"Duan CC, Yu JL, Tao J, Zhang C, Zhang D, Zeng X, Zeng WT, Xu HL, Qiu JY, Dennis CL, Jin L, Huang HF, Wu YT.",Trials,2022,2022.9.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common among pregnant women. Internet-delivered psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) have been developed to increase accessibility and address common help-seeking barriers, especially during pandemic period. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of iCBT on reducing depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic with the overall goal of preventing depression recurrence in the first 12 months postpartum. METHODS: A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted where 300 pregnant women early in their third trimester will be screened for depression symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during a routine obstetrical visit. Eligible and consenting women with a score greater than 9 will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either intervention group or control group. ICBT involving the completion of 7 weekly online modules will be delivered via a well-designed perinatal mental healthcare app. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of iCBT on reducing depression symptoms among pregnant Chinese women starting from their third trimester. The secondary objectives are to examine the effect of iCBT on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, parenting stress, co-parenting relationship, and infant development. DISCUSSION: This multi-center randomized controlled trial has been planned in accordance with best practices in behavioral trial design. The internet-based intervention addressed the needs of pregnant women during a major pandemic where face-to-face therapy is not preferable. The trial has a relatively large sample size with sufficient power to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT intervention for the primary and secondary outcomes. One year follow-up evaluation in the study is designed to determine the longer-term effect of the intervention on both maternal and infant outcomes. Although a limitation is the assessment of depression and anxiety using self-report measures, these easily incorporated and maternal-preferred assessments allow for real-life scalability if the intervention is proven to be effective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics was approved by the institutional review board of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital (GKLW2020-25). Dissemination of results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented at scientific conferences. TRIAL STATUS: The first patient was enrolled on 19 August 2020.

Digital CBT may provide a scalable means of delivering CBT at a population level. We investigated the efficacy of a novel digital CBT program in those with GAD for outcomes of anxiety, worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. METHODS: This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up (Week 10). RESULTS: Overall, 256 participants were randomized and intention-to-treat analysis found Daylight reduced symptoms of anxiety compared with waitlist control at post-intervention, reflecting a large effect size (adjusted difference [95% CI]: 3.22 [2.14, 4.31], d = 1.08). Significant improvements were found for measures of worry; depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. CONCLUSION: Digital CBT (Daylight) appears to be safe and efficacious for symptoms of anxiety, worry, and further measures of mental health compared with waitlist control in individuals with GAD."
10.1186/s13063-023-07634-0,SuRxgWell: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of telemedicine-based digital cognitive behavioral intervention for high anxiety and depression among patients undergoing elective hip and knee arthroplasty surgery,"Kaynar AM, Lin C, Sanchez AG, Lavage DR, Monroe A, Zharichenko N, Strassburger M, Saucier K, Groff YJ, Klatt BA, O'Malley MJ, Szigethy E, Wasan AD, Chelly JE.",Trials,2023,2023.11.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Mood disorders (anxiety, depression), sleep disorders, and catastrophizing lead to increased post-operative pain perception, increase in postoperative opioid consumption, decreased engagement with physical activity, and increased resource utilization in surgical patients. Psychosocial disorders significantly affect postoperative outcome. Unfortunately, studies focused on perioperative psychological assessment and treatment are scarce. We propose to test whether digital cognitive behavioral intervention (dCBI) can help surgical patients. dCBI such as RxWell™ is a proven treatment for mood disorders in medical patients such as reducing depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We hypothesize that RxWell™ will also be effective in surgical patients. This study aims to test whether RxWell™ can improve preoperative mood disorders and subsequently reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirement in patients scheduled for primary total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA, TKA). We named the trial as the SuRxgWell trial. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled trial that will enroll primary and unilateral THA or TKA patients with anxiety and/or depression symptoms before surgery to receive the SuRxgWell dCBI program and investigate its impact on postoperative outcomes including postoperative pain, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and catastrophizing. After signing an informed consent, subjects will be screened using the PROMIS questionnaires, and subjects with a T-score of ≥ 60 on the short Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4a Anxiety and/or short PROMIS 4a Depression questionnaires will be randomized to either usual care (control group) or the cognitive behavioral intervention, RxWell™, plus usual care (intervention group). The control group will receive information on how to locate tools to address anxiety and depression, whereas the intervention group will have access to SuRxgWell 1 month prior to surgery and up to 3 months after surgery. The allocation will be 3:1 (intervention to control). Investigators will be blinded, but research coordinators approaching patients and research subjects will not. The primary outcome will be day of surgery anxiety or depression symptoms measured with the PROMIS Short Form v1.0 -Anxiety 4a/Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Measure (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Secondary end points include measuring other health-related quality of life outcomes including sleep disturbance, fatigue, ability to participate in social roles, pain interference, cognitive function, pain catastrophizing, and physical function. Other secondary outcomes include collecting data about preoperative and postoperative pain scores, and pain medication usage, and orthopedic functional recovery at baseline, day of surgery, and 1, 2, and 3 months after the surgery with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Hip injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). In addition, subjects will be asked to complete a GAD-7 and PHQ-8 questionnaires bi-weekly (via the RxWell™ app for the interventional group or REDCAP for the control group). Data about postsurgical complications, and resource utilization will also be recorded. We will also receive monthly reports measuring the usage and engagement of RxWell use for each participant randomized to that arm. The primary hypotheses will be assessed with intention-to-treat estimates, and differences in primary outcome will be tested using independent two sample t-tests. This trial is registered to the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT05658796) and supported by the DAPM, UPMC Health Plan, and the NIH. DISCUSSION: Our trial will evaluate the feasibility of digital cognitive behavioral intervention as a perioperative tool to improve anxiety and depression before and after major orthopedic surgery in comparison to education. If digital cognitive behavioral intervention proves to be effective, this might have important clinical implications, reducing the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain and improving outcomes."

Relapse prevention interventions may prevent chronicity. Aim of the study is therefore to (1) examine efficacy of the personalised StayFine app for remitted youth and (2) identify high-risk groups for relapse and resilience. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: In this Dutch single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial, efficacy of app-based monitoring combined with guided app-based personalised StayFine intervention modules is assessed compared with monitoring only. In both conditions, care as usual is allowed. StayFine modules plus monitoring is hypothesised to be superior to monitoring only in preventing relapse over 36 months. Participants (N=254) are 13-21 years and in remission of depression or anxiety for >2 months. Randomisation (1:1) is stratified by previous treatment (no treatment vs treatment) and previous episodes (1, 2 or >3 episodes). Assessments include diagnostic interviews, online questionnaires and monitoring (ecological momentary assessment with optional wearable) after 0, 4, 12, 24 and 36 months. The StayFine modules are guided by certified experts by experience and based on preventive cognitive therapy and ingredients of cognitive behavioural therapy. Personalisation is based on shared decision-making informed by baseline assessments and individual symptom networks. Time to relapse (primary outcome) is assessed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-lifetime version diagnostic interview. Intention-to-treat survival analyses will be used to examine the data. Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression and anxiety, number and duration of relapses, global functioning, and quality of life. Mediators and moderators will be explored. Exploratory endpoints are monitoring and wearable outcomes.

10.2196/47960,Effectiveness of a Web-based and Mobile Therapy Chatbot on Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in Subclinical Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Karkosz S, Szymański R, Sanna K, Michałowski J.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.3.20,,,"BACKGROUND: There has been an increased need to provide specialized help for people with depressive and anxiety symptoms, particularly teenagers and young adults. There is evidence from a 2-week intervention that chatbots (eg, Woebot) are effective in reducing depression and anxiety, an effect that was not detected in the control group that was provided self-help materials. Although chatbots are a promising solution, there is limited scientific evidence for the efficacy of agent-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outside the English language, especially for highly inflected languages. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the efficacy of Fido, a therapy chatbot that uses the Polish language. It targets depressive and anxiety symptoms using CBT techniques. We hypothesized that participants using Fido would show a greater reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms than the control group. METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial with 81 participants with subclinical depression or anxiety who were recruited via social media. Participants were divided into experimental (interacted with a fully automated Fido chatbot) and control (received a self-help book) groups. Both intervention methods addressed topics such as general psychoeducation and cognitive distortion identification and modification via Socratic questioning. The chatbot also featured suicidal ideation identification and redirection to suicide hotlines. We used self-assessment scales to measure primary outcomes, including the levels of depression, anxiety, worry tendencies, satisfaction with life, and loneliness at baseline, after the 2-week intervention and at the 1-month follow-up. We also controlled for secondary outcomes, including engagement and frequency of use. RESULTS: There were no differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms between the groups at enrollment and baseline. After the intervention, depressive and anxiety symptoms were reduced in both groups (chatbot: n=36; control: n=38), which remained stable at the 1-month follow-up. Loneliness was not significantly different between the groups after the intervention, but an exploratory analysis showed a decline in loneliness among participants who used Fido more frequently. Both groups used their intervention technique with similar frequency; however, the control group spent more time (mean 117.57, SD 72.40 minutes) on the intervention than the Fido group (mean 79.44, SD 42.96 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: We did not replicate the findings from previous (eg, Woebot) studies, as both arms yielded therapeutic effects. However, such results are in line with other research of Internet interventions. Nevertheless, Fido provided sufficient help to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms and decreased perceived loneliness among high-frequency users, which is one of the first pieces of evidence of chatbot efficacy with agents that use a highly inflected language. Further research is needed to determine the long-term, real-world effectiveness of Fido and its efficacy in a clinical sample.

Unfortunately, individuals with both CBP and recurrent MDD are underidentified. Utilizing health care insurance data may provide a possibility to better identify this complex population. In addition, internet- and mobile-based interventions might enhance the availability of existing treatments and provide help to those highly burdened individuals. OBJECTIVE: This pilot randomized controlled trial investigated the feasibility of recruitment via the health records of a German health insurance company. The study also examined user satisfaction and effectiveness of a 9-week cognitive behavioral therapy and Web- and mobile-based guided self-help intervention Get.Back in CBP patients with recurrent MDD on sick leave compared with a waitlist control condition. METHODS: Health records from a German health insurance company were used to identify and recruit participants (N=76) via invitation letters. Study outcomes were measured using Web-based self-report assessments at baseline, posttreatment (9 weeks), and a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression); secondary outcomes included anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life), pain-related variables (Oswestry Disability Index, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and pain intensity), and negative effects (Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy). RESULTS: The total enrollment rate with the recruitment strategy used was 1.26% (76/6000). Participants completed 4.8 modules (SD 2.6, range 0-7) of Get.Back. The overall user satisfaction was favorable (mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire score=24.5, SD 5.2). Covariance analyses showed a small but statistically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity in the intervention group (n=40) at posttreatment compared with the waitlist control group (n=36; F1,76=3.62, P=.03; d=0.28, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.74). Similar findings were noted for the reduction of anxiety symptoms (F1,76=10.45; P=.001; d=0.14, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.60) at posttreatment. Other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant (.06≤P≤.44). At the 6-month follow-up, the difference between the groups with regard to reduction in depressive symptom severity was no longer statistically significant (F1,76=1.50, P=.11; d=0.10, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.46). The between-group difference in anxiety at posttreatment was maintained to follow-up (F1,76=2.94, P=.04; d=0.38, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.83). There were no statistically significant differences across groups regarding other secondary outcomes at the 6-month follow-up (.08≤P≤.42). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that participants with comorbid depression and CBP on sick leave may benefit from internet- and mobile-based interventions, as exemplified with the positive user satisfaction ratings. The recruitment strategy via health insurance letter invitations appeared feasible, but more research is needed to understand how response rates in untreated individuals with CBP and comorbid depression can be increased.

Despite this burden, few Chinese students seek mental health treatment. In addition, depression is highly comorbid with other mental health disorders, such as anxiety. Scalable, transdiagnostic, evidence-based interventions are needed for this population. OBJECTIVE: The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a World Health Organization transdiagnostic digital mental health intervention, Step-by-Step, to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms and improve well-being compared with enhanced care as usual and its implementation in a Chinese university community. METHODS: A type 1 effectiveness-implementation two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. The two conditions are 1) the 5-session Step-by-Step program with minimal guidance by trained peer-helpers and 2) psychoeducational information on depression and anxiety and referrals to local community services. A total of 334 Chinese university students will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to either of the two groups. Depression, anxiety, wellbeing, and client defined problems will be assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Endline qualitative interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted to explore SbS implementation among service users, university staff, and stakeholders. Data will be analysed based on the intent-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: Step-by-Step is an innovative approach to address common mental health problems in populations with sufficient digital literacy. It is a promising intervention that can be embedded to scale mental health services within a university setting. It is anticipated that after successful evaluation of the program and its implementation in the type 1 hybrid design RCT study, Step-by-Step can be scaled and maintained as a low-intensity treatment in universities, and potentially extended to other populations within the Chinese community.

Significant barriers preclude a majority of patients from receiving first line treatments for both disorders in a sequential treatment episode. Although digital versions of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) and for depression (CBTD) hold some promise to meet demand, especially when paired with human support, it is unknown whether heterogeneity of treatment effects exist, such that some patients would be optimally treated with single or sequential interventions. OBJECTIVE: Describe the protocol for a two-phase, prescriptive comparative effectiveness study to develop and evaluate an individualized intervention rule (IIR) for prescribing the optimal digital treament of co-occurring insomnia and depression. METHODS: The proposed sample size is 2300 U.S. military veterans with insomnia and depression recruited nationally (Phase 1 = 1500; Phase 2 = 800). In each phase, the primary endpoint will be remission of both depression and insomnia 3 months following a 12-week intervention period. Phase 1 is a 5-arm randomized trial: two single digital interventions (CBT-I or CBT-D); two sequenced interventions (CBT-I + D or CBT-D + I); and a mood monitoring control condition. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to develop the IIR. Phase 2 will evaluate the IIR by randomizing participants with equal allocation to either the IIR predicted optimal intervention for that individual or by randomization to one the four CBT interventions. RESULTS: Study procedures are ongoing. Results will be reported in future manuscripts. CONCLUSION: The study will generate evidence on the optimal scalable approach to treat co-occurring insomnia and depression. Published by Elsevier Inc."

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analyses (NMA) to make comparisons of digital psychotherapies. METHODS: A bayesian NMA was conducted in this study. The databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINAL were searched for all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from Jan 1, 2012 to Oct 1, 2022. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of bias tool for quality assessment. The primary outcomes were set as a standardized mean difference model in efficacy to describe continuous outcomes. We used STATA and WinBUGS to conduct a bayesian network meta-analysis of all interventions based on a random-effects model. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022374558. RESULTS: From the retrieved 16,750 publications, we included 72 RCTs (13,096 participants) with the overall medium quality and above. In terms of depression scale, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective than TAU (SMDs 0.53) and NT (SMDs 0.98). In terms of anxiety scale, CBT (SMDs 0.68; SMDs 0.72) and exercise therapy (ERT) (SMDs 1.01; SMDs 1.05) were more effective than TAU and NT. LIMITATIONS: Uneven quality of literature, simple network, and subjective judgment. CONCLUSION: Based on NMA results, we suggest that CBT, which is the most commonly used digital technology, should be preferred among digital psychotherapy for relieving depression and anxiety symptoms.

However, there are fewer randomized controlled studies on POIs among older adults with depression. The goal of the present study was to compare the use and efficacy of Deprexis, an online intervention for depression, among Millennials (18-35 years) and Baby Boomers (50-65 years). METHODS: We completed a secondary data analysis on a subset (N = 577) of participants in the EVIDENT trial, a parallel-groups, pragmatic, randomized, controlled single-blind study, which compared a 12-week POI (Deprexis) to care as usual (CAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (post-assessment) and 6 months (follow-up). The main outcome of interest was change on self-rated depression severity (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Compared to Millennials, Boomers used the intervention significantly more often (d = 0.45) and for a longer duration (d = 0.46), and endorsed more positive attitudes towards POIs (d = 0.14). There was no significant Age Group by Intervention Group interaction for change in PHQ-9. The post-assessment between-group effect size (intervention vs. CAU control) for Millennials and Boomers were d = 0.26 and d = 0.39, respectively, and were stable at follow-up (d = 0.37 and d = 0.39). LIMITATIONS: Age-based dichotomization may not accurately represent participants' experiences with and use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: The POI examined in this trial was superior to CAU and was comparably effective among groups of adults defined as Millennials and Baby Boomers. Adults of the Baby Boomer generation who participate in POIs may have more positive attitudes towards POIs compared to their younger counterparts."

While pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment, adjunctive psychotherapy can improve outcomes. However, access to therapy is limited. Smartphones and other technologies can increase access to therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while simultaneously augmenting care by providing adaptive delivery of content to users as well as alerts to providers to facilitate clinical care communication. Unfortunately, while adaptive interventions are being developed and tested to improve care, information describing the components of adaptive interventions is often not published in sufficient detail to facilitate replication and improvement of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: To contribute to and support the improvement and dissemination of technology-based mental health interventions, we provide a detailed description of the expert system for adaptively delivering content and facilitating clinical care communication for LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for individuals with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Information from empirically supported psychotherapies for bipolar disorder, health psychology behavior change theories, and chronic disease self-management models was combined with user-centered design data and psychiatrist feedback to guide the development of the expert system. RESULTS: Decision points determining the timing of intervention option adaptation were selected to occur daily and weekly based on self-report data for medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and wellness levels. These data were selected for use as the tailoring variables determining which intervention options to deliver when and to whom. Decision rules linking delivery of options and tailoring variable thresholds were developed based on existing literature regarding bipolar disorder clinical status and psychiatrist feedback. To address the need for treatment adaptation with varying clinical statuses, decision rules for a clinical status state machine were developed using self-reported wellness rating data. Clinical status from this state machine was incorporated into hierarchal decision tables that select content for delivery to users and alerts to providers. The majority of the adaptive content addresses sleep duration, medication adherence, managing signs and symptoms, building and utilizing support, and keeping a regular routine, as well as determinants underlying engagement in these target behaviors as follows: attitudes and perceptions, knowledge, support, evaluation, and planning. However, when problems with early warning signs, symptoms, and transitions to more acute clinical states are detected, the decision rules shift the adaptive content to focus on managing signs and symptoms, and engaging with psychiatric providers. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive mental health technologies have the potential to enhance the self-management of mental health disorders. The need for individuals with bipolar disorder to engage in the management of multiple target behaviors and to address changes in clinical status highlights the importance of detailed reporting of adaptive intervention components to allow replication and improvement of adaptive mental health technologies for complex mental health problems."
10.1016/j.brat.2023.104369,Mechanisms of change in digital cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in patients with chronic back pain: A mediation analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial,"Lutsch AG, Baumeister H, Paganini S, Sander LB, Terhorst Y, Domhardt M.",Behav Res Ther,2023,2023.8.2,,,"BACKGROUND: While there is evolving knowledge on change processes of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of depression, little is known about how these interventions produce therapeutic change in the comorbid constellation of chronic back pain (CBP). Here, we examined whether the effects of a digital intervention to treat depression in patients with CBP are mediated by three pain-related variables (i.e., pain self-efficacy, pain-related disability, pain intensity). METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted in routine care at 82 orthopedic clinics across Germany. In total, 209 adults with CBP and diagnosed depression (SCID interview) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 104) or treatment-as-usual (n = 105). Cross-lagged mediation models were estimated to investigate longitudinal mediation effects of putative mediators with depression symptom severity (PHQ-9) as primary outcome at post-treatment. RESULTS: Longitudinal mediation effects were observed for pain self-efficacy (ß = -0.094, 95%-CI [-0.174, -0.014], p = 0.021) and pain-related disability (ß = -0.068, 95%-CI [-0.130, -0.001], p = 0.047). Furthermore, the hypothesized direction of the mediation effects was supported, reversed causation did not occur. Pain intensity did not reveal a mediation effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a relevant role of pain self-efficacy and pain-related disability as change processes in the treatment of depression for patients with CBP in routine care. However, further research is needed to disclose potential reciprocal relationships of mediators, and to extend and specify our knowledge of the mechanisms of change in digital CBT for depression."
10.1186/s13063-022-06850-4,Sleep to Reduce Incident Depression Effectively (STRIDE): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial comparing stepped-care cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia versus sleep education control to prevent major depression,"Drake CL, Kalmbach DA, Cheng P, Ahmedani BK, Peterson EL, Joseph CLM, Roth T, Kidwell KM, Sagong C.",Trials,2022,2022.12.2,,,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health priority. Strategies targeting individuals at elevated risk for MDD may guide effective preventive care. Insomnia is a reliable precursor to depression, preceding half of all incident and relapse cases. Thus, insomnia may serve as a useful entry point for preventing MDD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia, but widespread implementation is limited by a shortage of trained specialists. Innovative stepped-care approaches rooted in primary care can increase access to CBT-I and reduce rates of MDD. METHODS/DESIGN: We propose a large-scale stepped-care clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with clinician-led CBT-I for insomnia and the prevention of MDD incidence and relapse. Specifically, our care model uses digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) as a first-line intervention to increase care access and reduce the need for specialist resources. Our proposal also adds clinician-led CBT-I for patients who do not remit with first-line intervention and need a more personalized approach from specialty care. We will evaluate negative repetitive thinking as a potential treatment mechanism by which dCBT-I and CBT-I benefit insomnia and depression outcomes. DISCUSSION: This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination and implementation to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression.

This applies particularly to men, who represent nearly two-thirds of those who die by suicide in Ontario. One way of potentially addressing this gap is to offer a course of blended problem-solving therapy, comprised of a brief course of evidence-based psychotherapy for individuals at risk for suicide, facilitated by the use of a patient-facing smartphone application and a clinician-facing ""dashboard."" This approach has the potential to combine the benefits of face-to-face therapy and technology to create a novel intervention. METHODS: This is a cohort study nested within a larger pragmatic multicentre pre- and post-design cluster randomised trial. Suicidal ideation assessed by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation is the primary outcome variable. Secondary outcome measures include depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale), post-traumatic stress disorder (Primary Care PTSD Screen), health-related quality of life (EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire), meaning in life (Experienced Meaning in Life Scale), perceived social supports (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support), alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), drug use (Drug Abuse Screening Test Short Form 10), problem-solving skills (Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised Short Form), and self-reported healthcare costs, as well as health service use measured using Ontario administrative health data. A process evaluation will also be conducted following study completion. DISCUSSION: The cohort study will test whether better adherence to the intervention results in better outcomes. The value of the cohort study design is that we can examine in more detail certain subgroups or other variables that are not available in the larger cluster randomised trial. This trial will aim to improve standards by informing best practice in management of men who self-harm and present to hospitals in Ontario. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03473535 .

Nevertheless, only about half of individuals treated with CBT benefit from it. Predictive algorithms, including digital assessments and passive sensing features, could better identify patients who would benefit from CBT, and thus, improve treatment choices. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish predictive features that forecast responses to transdiagnostic CBT in anxiety disorders and to investigate key mechanisms underlying treatment responses. METHODS: This study is a 2-armed randomized controlled clinical trial. We include patients with anxiety disorders who are randomized to either a transdiagnostic CBT group or a waitlist (referred to as WAIT). We index key features to predict responses prior to starting treatment using subjective self-report questionnaires, experimental tasks, biological samples, ecological momentary assessments, activity tracking, and smartphone-based passive sensing to derive a multimodal feature set for predictive modeling. Additional assessments take place weekly at mid- and posttreatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups to index anxiety and depression symptom severity. We aim to include 150 patients, randomized to CBT versus WAIT at a 3:1 ratio. The data set will be subject to full feature and important features selected by minimal redundancy and maximal relevance feature selection and then fed into machine leaning models, including eXtreme gradient boosting, pattern recognition network, and k-nearest neighbors to forecast treatment response. The performance of the developed models will be evaluated. In addition to predictive modeling, we will test specific mechanistic hypotheses (eg, association between self-efficacy, daily symptoms obtained using ecological momentary assessments, and treatment response) to elucidate mechanisms underlying treatment response. RESULTS: The trial is now completed. It was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee, Zurich. The results will be disseminated through publications in scientific peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this trial is to improve current CBT treatment by precise forecasting of treatment response and by understanding and potentially augmenting underpinning mechanisms and personalizing treatment.

BACKGROUND: Prevention of perinatal depression beginning from the antenatal period is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of recently developed internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for preventing the onset of a major depressive episode (MDE) in the third trimester and at 3 months postpartum. METHODS: This is a two-arm, parallel-group, general-information controlled, randomized controlled trial. Participants were 5017 pregnant women at 16-20 weeks' gestation without MDE at baseline. They were randomly assigned to an iCBT (intervention; n = 2509) or general-information (control; n = 2508) group, stratified by psychological distress at baseline. The primary outcomes were the numbers of new MDE onsets, measured using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0, at 32 weeks' gestation and at 3 months postpartum. RESULTS: New MDE onset was reported by 59 participants (2.35%) in the intervention group and 73 (2.91%) in the control group during follow-up. Compared with the control group, the hazard ratio (HR) of MDE in the intervention group was 0.85 (95% CI 0.61-1.20), which was not significantly different. Among participants who scored between 5 and 8 on K6 at baseline, 10 (1.37%) in the intervention group reported new onset of MDE, compared with 28 (3.81%) in the control group, and the HR of MDE was 0.38 (95%CI 0.19-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: No intervention effect was found for iCBT in preventing new onset of perinatal MDE. iCBT might prevent perinatal depression only among pregnant women with subthreshold depressive symptoms.

10.2196/53236,Investigating the Effectiveness of Technology-Based Distal Interventions for Postpartum Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Brocklehurst SP, Morse AR, Cruwys T, Batterham PJ, Leach L, Robertson AM, Sahib A, Burke CT, Nguyen J, Calear AL.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.11.19,,,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum anxiety and depression are common in new parents. While effective interventions exist, they are often delivered in person, which can be a barrier for some parents seeking help. One approach to overcoming these barriers is the delivery of evidence-based self-help interventions via websites, smartphone apps, and other digital media. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based distal interventions in reducing or preventing symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety in male and female birth and adoptive parents, explore the effectiveness of technology-based distal interventions in increasing social ties, and determine the level of adherence to and satisfaction with technology-based distal interventions. METHODS: A systematic review and series of meta-analyses were conducted. Three electronic bibliographic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating technology-based distal interventions for postpartum depression or anxiety in birth and adoptive parents. Searches were updated on August 1, 2023, before conducting the final meta-analyses. Data on trial characteristics, effectiveness, adherence, satisfaction, and quality were extracted. Screening and data extraction were conducted by 2 reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute quality rating scale for randomized controlled trials. Studies were initially synthesized qualitatively. Where possible, studies were also quantitatively synthesized through 5 meta-analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, with 14 (78%) providing sufficient data for a meta-analysis. A small significant between-group effect on depression favored the intervention conditions at the postintervention (Cohen d=-0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.15; P<.001) and follow-up (Cohen d=-0.27, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.02; P=.03) time points. A small significant effect on anxiety also favored the intervention conditions at the postintervention time point (Cohen d=-0.29, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.10; P=.002), with a medium effect at follow-up (Cohen d=-0.47, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.05; P=.03). The effect on social ties was not significant at the postintervention time point (Cohen d=0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.21; P=.61). Effective interventions tended to be web-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs with reminders. Adherence varied considerably between studies, whereas satisfaction tended to be high for most studies. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-based distal interventions are effective in reducing symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety in birth mothers. Key limitations of the reviewed evidence include heterogeneity in outcome measures, studies being underpowered to detect modest effects, and the exclusion of key populations from the evidence base. More research needs to be conducted with birth fathers and adoptive parents to better ascertain the effectiveness of interventions in these populations, as well as to further assess the effect of technology-based distal interventions on social ties.

Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence-driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. METHODS: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. RESULTS: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants' W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change -9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change -1.3, SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change -1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change -2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). CONCLUSIONS: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

10.2196/45099,Using Intervention Mapping and Behavior Change Techniques to Develop a Digital Intervention for Self-Management in Stroke: Development Study,"Wong AWK, Fong MWM, Munsell EGS, Metts CL, Lee SI, Nicol GE, DePaul O, Tomazin SE, Kaufman KJ, Mohr DC.",JMIR Hum Factors,2023,2023.7.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutics, such as interventions provided via smartphones or the internet, have been proposed as promising solutions to support self-management in persons with chronic conditions. However, the evidence supporting self-management interventions through technology in stroke is scarce, and the intervention development processes are often not well described, creating challenges in explaining why and how the intervention would work. OBJECTIVE: This study describes a specific use case of using intervention mapping (IM) and the taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in designing a digital intervention to manage chronic symptoms and support daily life participation in people after stroke. IM is an implementation science framework used to bridge the gap between theories and practice to ensure that the intervention can be implemented in real-world settings. The taxonomy of BCTs consists of a set of active ingredients designed to change self-management behaviors. METHODS: We used the first 4 steps of the IM process to develop a technology-supported self-management intervention, interactive Self-Management Augmented by Rehabilitation Technologies (iSMART), adapted from a face-to-face stroke-focused psychoeducation program. Planning group members were involved in adapting the intervention. They also completed 3 implementation measures to assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of iSMART. RESULTS: In step 1, we completed a needs assessment consisting of assembling a planning group to codevelop the intervention, conducting telephone surveys of people after stroke (n=125) to identify service needs, and performing a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to examine evidence of the effectiveness of digital self-management interventions to improve patient outcomes. We identified activity scheduling, symptom management, stroke prevention, access to care resources, and cognitive enhancement training as key service needs after a stroke. The review suggested that digital self-management interventions, especially those using cognitive behavioral theory, effectively reduce depression, anxiety, and fatigue and enhance self-efficacy in neurological disorders. Step 2 identified key determinants, objectives, and strategies for self-management in iSMART, including knowledge, behavioral regulation, skills, self-efficacy, motivation, negative and positive affect, and social and environmental support. In step 3, we generated the intervention components underpinned by appropriate BCTs. In step 4, we developed iSMART with the planning group members. Especially, iSMART simplified the original psychoeducation program and added 2 new components: SMS text messaging and behavioral coaching, intending to increase the uptake by people after stroke. iSMART was found to be acceptable (mean score 4.63, SD 0.38 out of 5), appropriate (mean score 4.63, SD 0.38 out of 5), and feasible (mean score 4.58, SD 0.34 out of 5). CONCLUSIONS: We describe a detailed example of using IM and the taxonomy of BCTs for designing and developing a digital intervention to support people after stroke in managing chronic symptoms and maintaining active participation in daily life."

A PRISMA-guided systematic search was used, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the above-mentioned interventions. Data were pooled using either the mean difference (MD) or standardized MD (SMD). Sub-group analyses were carried out when appropriate. The primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, as well as sleep quality and quality of life. The interventions' acceptability was evaluated through the odds ratio (OR) of drop-out rates. Seven RCTs were included, comprising 1873 pregnant women. The results showed the interventions' efficacy in terms of reducing depression symptoms (SMD = -0.36, CI = 0.61, -0.11, k = 9) at the endpoint, although it was not maintained at follow-up during the postpartum period. The interventions' efficacy in terms of reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD = 1.96, CI = -2.72, -1.21, k = 3) at the endpoint was also significant, while having no effect on sleep quality. The interventions were well accepted (OR = 1.68; 95% CI = 0.84, 3.35; k = 7). Although no sound conclusions can be drawn concerning the joint or differential efficacy of the considered interventions, this study was useful in highlighting the need to develop evidence-based digital prevention programs for pregnant women with sub-clinical symptoms."

BACKGROUND: There is often a waiting period for people who seek psychiatric treatment for depression or anxiety. As this delay risks worsening symptoms, an alternative could be to provide an intervention that requires minimal resources during the waiting period. AIMS: The aim was to investigate if a digital problem-solving intervention delivered in a self-guided format with automated features is feasible to provide for patients on the waiting list in routine psychiatric care. METHOD: A total of 12 patients with symptoms of depression or anxiety on the waiting list for treatment in routine psychiatric care were given access to a self-guided and monitored digital problem-solving intervention over 4 weeks. Primary outcome measures were treatment credibility and usability. Secondary outcome measures were behavioural engagement, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and negative effects. RESULTS: A majority of participants rated the intervention as both credible and usable. The intervention was used at least once by nine out of 12 individuals, with an average of 11 logins. The participants did, on average, initiate 2.8 problem-solving attempts and 10.1 solutions. A few participants reached a clinically relevant symptom improvement of depression and anxiety. No serious negative effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The credibility and usability of the intervention was perceived as good, and the behavioural engagement with the intervention was deemed sufficient compared with similar self-guided interventions. A self-guided and monitored digital problem-solving intervention may be a beneficial option for patients waiting for or receiving treatment in routine psychiatric care, and should be further evaluated."

AIMS: The aim was to investigate if a digital problem-solving intervention delivered in a self-guided format with automated features is feasible to provide for patients on the waiting list in routine psychiatric care. METHOD: A total of 12 patients with symptoms of depression or anxiety on the waiting list for treatment in routine psychiatric care were given access to a self-guided and monitored digital problem-solving intervention over 4 weeks. Primary outcome measures were treatment credibility and usability. Secondary outcome measures were behavioural engagement, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and negative effects. RESULTS: A majority of participants rated the intervention as both credible and usable. The intervention was used at least once by nine out of 12 individuals, with an average of 11 logins. The participants did, on average, initiate 2.8 problem-solving attempts and 10.1 solutions. A few participants reached a clinically relevant symptom improvement of depression and anxiety. No serious negative effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The credibility and usability of the intervention was perceived as good, and the behavioural engagement with the intervention was deemed sufficient compared with similar self-guided interventions. A self-guided and monitored digital problem-solving intervention may be a beneficial option for patients waiting for or receiving treatment in routine psychiatric care, and should be further evaluated."
10.1111/jsr.13709,Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity prospectively predicts distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: The protective effect of insomnia treatment,"Reffi AN, Drake CL, Kalmbach DA, Jovanovic T, Norrholm SD, Roth T, Casement MD, Cheng P.",J Sleep Res,2023,2022.9.2,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a rare stressor that has precipitated an accompanying mental health crisis. Prospective studies traversing the pandemic's onset can elucidate how pre-existing disease vulnerabilities augured risk for later stress-related morbidity. We examined how pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted maladaptive stress reactions and depressive symptoms in response to, and during, the pandemic. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial from 2016 to 2017 comparing digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) against sleep education (N = 208). Thus, we also assessed whether dCBT-I moderated the association between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and pandemic-related distress. Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity was measured at baseline using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test. In April 2020, participants were recontacted to report pandemic-related distress (stress reactions and depression). Controlling for the treatment condition and the degree of COVID-19 impact, higher pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted more stress reactions (β = 0.13, ± 0.07 SE, p = 0.045) and depression (β = 0.22, ± 0.07 SE, p = 0.001) during the pandemic. Further, the odds of reporting clinically significant stress reactions and depression during the pandemic were over twice as high in those with high pre-pandemic sleep reactivity. Notably, receiving dCBT-I in 2016-2017 mitigated the relationship between pre-pandemic sleep reactivity and later stress reactions (but not depression). Pre-pandemic sleep reactivity predicted psychological distress 3-4 years later during the COVID-19 pandemic, and dCBT-I attenuated its association with stress reactions, specifically. Sleep reactivity may inform prevention and treatment efforts by identifying individuals at risk of impairment following stressful events."
10.1016/j.invent.2022.100536,Component analysis of a synchronous and asynchronous blended care CBT intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety: Pragmatic retrospective study,"Lungu A, Wickham RE, Chen SY, Jun JJ, Leykin Y, Chen CE.",Internet Interv,2022,2022.4.18,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are leading causes of disability worldwide. Though effective treatments exist, depression and anxiety remain undertreated. Blended care psychotherapy, combining the scalability of online interventions with the personalization and engagement of a live therapist, is a promising approach for increasing access to evidence-based care. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and individual contribution of two components - i) digital tools and ii) video-based therapist-led sessions - in a blended care CBT-based intervention under real world conditions. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to analyze N = 1372 US-based individuals who enrolled in blended care psychotherapy. Of these, at baseline, 761 participants had depression symptoms in the clinical range (based on PHQ-9), and 1254 had anxiety symptoms in the clinical range (based on GAD-7). Participants had access to the program as a mental health benefit offered by their employer. The CBT-based blended care psychotherapy program consisted of regular video sessions with therapists, complemented by digital lessons and digital exercises assigned by the clinician and completed in between sessions. Depression and anxiety levels and clients' treatment engagement were tracked throughout treatment. A 3-level individual growth curve model incorporating time-varying covariates was utilized to examine symptom trajectories of PHQ-9 scores (for those with clinical range of depression at baseline) and GAD-7 scores (for those with clinical range of anxiety at baseline). RESULTS: On average, individuals exhibited a significant decline in depression and anxiety symptoms during the initial weeks of treatment (P < .001), and a continued decline over subsequent weeks at a slower rate (P < .001). Engaging in a therapy session in a week was associated with lower GAD-7 (b = -0.81) and PHQ-9 (b = -1.01) scores in the same week, as well as lower GAD-7 (b = -0.58) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.58) scores the following week (all P < .01). Similarly, engaging with digital lessons was independently associated with lower GAD-7 (b = -0.19) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.18) scores during the same week, and lower GAD-7 (b = -0.25) and PHQ-9 (b = -0.27) the following week (all P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Therapist-led video sessions and digital lessons had separate contributions to improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety over the course of treatment. Future research should investigate whether clients' characteristics are related to differential effects of therapist-led and digital components of care."
10.2196/44673,Skill Enactment and Knowledge Acquisition in Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Jackson HM, Calear AL, Batterham PJ, Ohan JL, Farmer GM, Farrer LM.",J Med Internet Res,2023,2023.5.31,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions can effectively prevent and treat depression and anxiety, but engagement with these programs is often low. Although extensive research has evaluated program use as a proxy for engagement, the extent to which users acquire knowledge and enact skills from these programs has been largely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how skill enactment and knowledge acquisition have been measured, evaluate postintervention changes in skill enactment and knowledge acquisition, examine whether mental health outcomes are associated with skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and evaluate predictors of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition. METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and July 2022. We included RCTs comparing digital CBT with any comparison group in adolescents or adults (aged ≥12 years) for anxiety or depression. Eligible studies reported quantitative measures of skill enactment or knowledge acquisition. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs. Narrative synthesis was used to address the review questions. RESULTS: In total, 43 papers were included, of which 29 (67%) reported a skill enactment measure and 15 (35%) reported a knowledge acquisition measure. Skill enactment was typically operationalized as the frequency of enacting skills using the completion of in-program activities (ie, formal skill enactment; 13/29, 45%) and intervention-specific (9/29, 31%) or standardized (8/29, 28%) questionnaires. Knowledge measures included tests of CBT knowledge (6/15, 40%) or mental health literacy (5/15, 33%) and self-report questionnaires (6/15, 40%). In total, 17 studies evaluated postintervention changes in skill enactment or knowledge acquisition, and findings were mostly significant for skill enactment (6/8, 75% of the studies), CBT knowledge (6/6, 100%), and mental health literacy (4/5, 80%). Of the 12 studies that evaluated the association between skill enactment and postintervention mental health outcomes, most reported ≥1 significant positive finding on standardized questionnaires (4/4, 100%), formal skill enactment indicators (5/7, 71%), or intervention-specific questionnaires (1/1, 100%). None of the 4 studies that evaluated the association between knowledge acquisition and primary mental health outcomes reported significant results. A total of 13 studies investigated predictors of skill enactment; only type of guidance and improvements in psychological variables were associated with increased skill enactment in ≥2 analyses. Predictors of knowledge acquisition were evaluated in 2 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBT for depression and anxiety can improve skill enactment and knowledge acquisition. However, only skill enactment appears to be associated with mental health outcomes, which may depend on the type of measure examined. Additional research is needed to understand what types and levels of skill enactment and knowledge acquisition are most relevant for outcomes and identify predictors of these constructs.

10.2196/17185,Internet and Face-to-face Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Postnatal Depression Compared With Treatment as Usual: Randomized Controlled Trial of MumMoodBooster,"Milgrom J, Danaher BG, Seeley JR, Holt CJ, Holt C, Ericksen J, Tyler MS, Gau JM, Gemmill AW.",J Med Internet Res,2021,2021.12.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has confirmed that symptoms of postnatal depression (PND) can be ameliorated through internet-delivered psychological interventions. Advantages of internet-delivered treatment include anonymity, convenience, and catering to women who are unable to access face-to-face (FTF) treatments. To date, no research has examined the efficacy of such interventions compared directly with FTF treatments in women clinically diagnosed with PND. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the efficacy of one of the first web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions (internet CBT+coach calls) for PND (MumMoodBooster [MMB]) with FTF-CBT in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: In this study, 116 postnatal women with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of major or minor depression were randomized to MMB (39/116, 33.6%), FTF-CBT (39/116, 33.6%), or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) control condition (38/116, 32.8%). Diagnostic status was determined at baseline and at 21-week follow-up using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was evaluated using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the revised Beck Depression Inventory at baseline, 12-week follow-up (after treatment), and 21-week follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 116 participants, 107 (92.2%) had a diagnosis of major depression at baseline. Rates of remission from a major or minor depressive episode at 21 weeks in both the FTF-CBT and MMB groups were superior to that of the TAU group (56.6% and 47.7% less likely to be depressed, respectively) and they were not significantly different from each other. Although remission rates differed between TAU and FTF-CBT, growth models showed that, in terms of symptom reduction across time, the FTF-CBT treatment was not significantly better than TAU. By comparison, MMB was statistically superior to both TAU and FTF-CBT in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress from baseline to the 21-week follow-up (large and moderate effect sizes). Thus, after 21 weeks, the average symptom scores for depression and anxiety of women receiving MMB were approximately half those of women in both the TAU and FTF-CBT groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this RCT, MMB was at least as effective as FTF-CBT in achieving remission from a diagnosed PND episode. MMB was superior to TAU and FTF-CBT in encouraging and maintaining reduction of symptom severity over the 21-week follow-up for depressed postnatal women. These findings replicate results of prior studies on MMB that showed clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and they provide direct empirical support that internet-delivered treatment for depressed postnatal women is a viable alternative to FTF treatment. The generalizability of the results needs to be examined in future research, as RCTs of internet-based versus FTF treatments necessarily involve a subset of people who are willing to undertake either modality of treatment.

Unguided computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) has the potential to bridge this treatment gap. However, the real-world effectiveness of unguided cCBT interventions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to report the design and development of a new unguided cCBT-based multicomponent intervention, TreadWill, and its pragmatic evaluation. TreadWill was designed to be fully automated, engaging, easy to use, and accessible to LMICs. METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of TreadWill and the engagement level, we performed a double-blind, fully remote, and randomized controlled trial with 598 participants in India and analyzed the data using a completer's analysis. RESULTS: The users who completed at least half of the modules in TreadWill showed significant reduction in depression-related (P=.04) and anxiety-related (P=.02) symptoms compared with the waitlist control. Compared with a plain-text version with the same therapeutic content, the full-featured version of TreadWill showed significantly higher engagement (P=.01).

By acting either as a bridge to therapy or as a form of therapy, digital tools, such as those that provide internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT), may help clinicians support their patients' mental health needs. At one academic health system, a digital mental health program was deployed in primary care and outpatient behavioral health programs to help patients meet needs identified through screening or clinical visits. Over the first two years of operation, 138 clinicians (40% of eligible clinicians) prescribed the program to 2,228 unique patients, from which 1,117 (48.9%) enrolled. Patients who enrolled tended to be younger and healthier than non-enrollees. On average, enrolled patients spent 114.6 minutes within the iCBT program. Clinical improvement was assessed using pre- and post PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores for depression and anxiety, respectively. Pre/Post scores were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Patients with at least moderate depression had an average 23% reduction in PHQ-9 scores (median change -3(interquartile range 7), p<0.001) and those with at least moderate anxiety had a 26% reduction in GAD-7 scores (-4(7), p<0.001). Improvements were clinically and statistically significant. Future steps include performing a cost analysis to understand whether models utilizing iCBT are net cost-saving for health systems."

While these societal changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19-related depression and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants' anxiety and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used 2-tailed paired t tests to detect changes in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later. RESULTS: The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an average reduction of -1.72 (95% CI -2.35 to -1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and -0.48 (95% CI -0.71 to -0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during the 60-day intervention period. Text messaging interventions could serve as an important public health tool for disseminating strategies to manage mental health.

OBJECTIVE: This study developed and investigated a new, comprehensive, multifactorial, daily, intensive, psychologist coaching program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules. The program was delivered via the digital health care mobile services Noom Coach and InBody. METHODS: This was an open-label, active-comparator, randomized controlled trial. A total of 70 female participants with BMI scores above 24 kg/m2 and no clinical problems besides obesity were randomized into experimental and control groups. The experimental (ie, digital CBT) group (n=45) was connected with a therapist intervention using a digital health care service that provided daily feedback and assignments for 8 weeks. The control group (n=25) also used the digital health care service, but practiced self-care without therapist intervention. The main outcomes of this study were measured objectively at baseline, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks and included weight (kg) as well as other body compositions. Differences between groups were evaluated using independent t tests and a per-protocol framework. RESULTS: Mean weight loss at 8 weeks in the digital CBT group was significantly higher than in the control group (-3.1%, SD 4.5, vs -0.7%, SD 3.4, P=.04). Additionally, the proportion of subjects who attained conventional 5% weight loss from baseline in the digital CBT group was significantly higher than in the control group at 8 weeks (32% [12/38] vs 4% [1/21], P=.02) but not at 24 weeks. Mean fat mass reduction in the digital CBT group at 8 weeks was also significantly greater than in the control group (-6.3%, SD 8.8, vs -0.8%, SD 8.1, P=.02). Mean leptin and insulin resistance in the digital CBT group at 8 weeks was significantly reduced compared to the control group (-15.8%, SD 29.9, vs 7.2%, SD 35.9, P=.01; and -7.1%, SD 35.1, vs 14.4%, SD 41.2, P=.04). Emotional eating behavior (ie, mean score) measured by questionnaire (ie, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) at 8 weeks was significantly improved compared to the control group (-2.8%, SD 34.4, vs 21.6%, SD 56.9, P=.048). Mean snack calorie intake in the digital CBT group during the intervention period was significantly lower than in the control group (135.9 kcal, SD 86.4, vs 208.2 kcal, SD 166.3, P=.02). Lastly, baseline depression, anxiety, and self-esteem levels significantly predicted long-term clinical outcomes (24 weeks), while baseline motivation significantly predicted both short-term (8 weeks) and long-term clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that technology-based interventions should be multidimensional and are most effective with human feedback and support. This study is innovative in successfully developing and verifying the effects of a new CBT approach with a multidisciplinary team based on digital technologies rather than standalone technology-based interventions.

The first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), due to a lack of well-trained therapists and patient time constraints (travelling, work), CBT-I has not been popularized. The development of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is making the treatment more accessible. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: Interventions for dCBT-I were significantly better than other control conditions in both reducing insomnia and improving depression in patients with depression and insomnia comorbidities. The effect was found to be related to the duration of the intervention and the severity of insomnia before the intervention and therapist-involved dCBT-I has less shedding than self-help. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It's important for mental health practitioners to realize that insomnia in depressed people needs to be treated. Future trials may explore the effectiveness of therapist-guided dCBT-I in depressed populations and analyse the cost-effectiveness of this treatment. ABSTRACT: Aim The aim of the study was to systematically identify and synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioural therapy in insomnia with comorbid depression. Design Systematic review and metaanalysis. Methods A search was conducted on five English and four non-English databases from the inception of the databases to November 2023. This review adhered to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Statement 2020 and the included studies were evaluated using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This review examined sleep-related outcomes, including insomnia severity and sleep diaries, along with psychological outcomes, such as depression. We conducted a meta-analysis of each outcome using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 statistic. Results A total of seven articles with 1864 participants were included in this review. The results showed that the digital cognitive behavioural therapy group demonstrated a statistically significant amelioration in the severity of insomnia symptoms, as well as a reduction in depressive symptomatology compared with the control groups. The post-intervention effect was found to be related to the duration of the intervention and the severity of insomnia before the intervention. Conclusions Digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia application in patients with depression and insomnia was demonstrated to be effective, less time-consuming and more accessible. Relevance to Clinical Practice We may consider incorporating nurses into treatment plans and conducting nurse-led interventions in specific programs. In the future, nurses may be able to provide exclusive digital behavioural therapy for insomnia to patients with depression to achieve greater effectiveness."
10.1177/0300060520928686,Digital psychotherapy as an effective and timely treatment option for depression and anxiety disorders: Implications for rural and remote practice,Weightman M.,J Int Med Res,2020,2020.6.13,,,"Patients in regional, rural and remote communities experience perennial difficulties accessing mental health treatments in a timely manner, which contributes to inequitable outcomes when compared with their metropolitan counterparts. This situation frequently stems from a shortage of specialised face-to-face psychotherapy services available in local areas. The recent development of digital psychotherapy as an alternative treatment delivery method provides an opportunity to address this healthcare gap and to avoid the challenges related to workforce maldistribution. This article provides a targeted narrative review of the relevant evidence base, and discusses the potential applications within the rural and remote context. Multiple randomised controlled trials and a large meta-analysis demonstrate that digital psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy, is as effective as face-to-face psychotherapy. Its use has consequently been endorsed across international clinical practice guidelines as an efficacious and practical way to provide mental healthcare. Despite this, the adoption of digital psychotherapeutic options has been limited to date. Increased awareness of the available options may improve access to psychological treatments in rural and remote populations. Digital psychotherapy should be considered an option for patients with depressive or anxiety disorders of mild-to-moderate severity."

Insufficient sleep quality and quantity directly affect individuals; in turn, they indirectly affect the productivity, viability and safety of workplaces. Sleep issues also represent a global health concern for people and workplaces around the world. In addition to pharmaceutical aids, effective and accessible interventions need to address the underlying problems, as might be achieved by behavioural therapies or structured, cognitive interventions like mindfulness-based programs. The time intensity and relatively high costs of such tactics has limited their widespread adoption though. With a sample of 606 full-time working adults, the current study tests the potential effectiveness of a short, inexpensive, app-based, self-help mindfulness meditation programme for promoting sleep quality and quantity. Using a longitudinal randomised experimental design, the authors compared the utility of a 10-day mindfulness programme with a passive control group, as well as with an active control group that engaged in 10 days of mind-wandering exercises. Sleep benefits emerged immediately after the 10-day intervention but seemingly wore off about three months later. Acknowledging the interactions between sleep, depression and anxiety, we also measured the two latter variables. We also find that the intervention was effective on depression, but not on anxiety. These insights offer implications for both research and practice."

Yet, their limited access to and uptake of traditional mental health care is inequitable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile interventions emerged as a potential solution to this discontinued healthcare access, but more knowledge is needed about their effectiveness and impact on health equity. This equity-focused systematic review examined the effectiveness and equity impact of mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and 3 other databases, from date of database inception and until January 2021, for experimental studies on mobile interventions targeting pregnant and postpartum women. We used pooled and narrative synthesis methods to analyze effectiveness and equity data, critically appraised the methodological rigour of included studies using Cochrane tools, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search identified 6148 records, of which 18 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included. Mobile interventions had a clinically important impact on reducing the occurrence of depression (OR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.64]; absolute risk reduction RD: 7.14% [95% CI 4.92 to 9.36]; p<0.001) and preventing its severity perinatally (MD = -3.07; 95% CI -4.68 to -1.46; p<0.001). Mobile cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in managing postpartum depression (MD = -6.87; 95% CI -7.92 to -5.82; p<0.001), whereas other support-based interventions had no added benefit. Results on anxiety outcomes and utilization of care were limited. Our equity-focused analyses showed that ethnicity, age, education, and being primiparous were characteristics of influence to the effectiveness of mobile interventions. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for virtual mental health care, mobile interventions show promise in preventing and managing common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women. Such interventions carry the potential to address health inequity but more rigorous research that examines patients' intersecting social identities is needed."

STEADY is a novel complex intervention for people with type 1 diabetes and disordered eating (T1DE) of mild to moderate severity. The STEADY intervention integrates cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with diabetes education, and was developed using Experience-Based Co-Design. METHODS: The feasibility of STEADY will be tested using a randomised controlled feasibility trial. Forty adults with T1DE will be recruited and randomised into the STEADY intervention or treatment as usual control group. We will collect demographic, biomedical and psychometric data, routine glucose metrics and conduct the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Participants randomised to the STEADY intervention will receive 12 STEADY therapy sessions with a diabetes specialist nurse trained in CBT, delivered via videoconference and an optional smartphone app. The main outcome at 6 months will be the feasibility of STEADY (recruitment, dropout rates, feasibility of delivery). The secondary outcomes are biomedical (HbA1c and glucose time in range) and psychological (person-reported outcome measures in disordered eating, diabetes distress, depression and anxiety). A process evaluation will evaluate the fidelity, feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of STEADY, and participant experiences. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the East of England-Essex Research Ethics Committee (21/EE/0235).

Insomnia is associated with health consequences for cardiometabolic and immune systems, neurobehavioral function, depression, fatigue, and quality of life and may put BCS at particular risk. While pharmacotherapy for insomnia may address symptoms in the short-term, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is considered the gold standard insomnia treatment. We describe our protocol to determine the efficacy of voice-activated delivery of CBT-I components on insomnia symptoms compared to a sleep education control among BCS. METHODS: We will conduct a 6-week, randomized controlled trial with two arms. Intervention arm participants will receive a smart speaker device and will be asked to engage with the program daily, using a voice-activated speaker with an accompanying smart-phone app. Control participants will have access to a website with basic information about CBT-I, sleep, and breast cancer survivorship and will be asked to engage with the website as desired. DISCUSSION: Our primary outcome is the Insomnia Severity Index total score. Secondary outcomes include sleep diary outcomes (sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality). This study will provide evidence on a promising modality to deliver elements of CBT-I for BCS experiencing insomnia. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05233800 Released 3/25/2022."

New technologies allow delivery of prevention programs scalable to large and disparate populations. OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the novel mobile phone delivery of a depression prevention intervention for adolescents. We describe the development of the intervention and the results of participants' self-reported satisfaction with the intervention. METHODS: The intervention was developed from 15 key messages derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The program was fully automated and delivered in 2 mobile phone messages/day for 9 weeks, with a mixture of text, video, and cartoon messages and a mobile website. Delivery modalities were guided by social cognitive theory and marketing principles. The intervention was compared with an attention control program of the same number and types of messages on different topics. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken in high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, from June 2009 to April 2011. RESULTS: A total of 1348 students (13-17 years of age) volunteered to participate at group sessions in schools, and 855 were eventually randomly assigned to groups. Of these, 835 (97.7%) self-completed follow-up questionnaires at postprogram interviews on satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and adherence to the intervention. Over three-quarters of participants viewed at least half of the messages and 90.7% (379/418) in the intervention group reported they would refer the program to a friend. Intervention group participants said the intervention helped them to be more positive (279/418, 66.7%) and to get rid of negative thoughts (210/418, 50.2%)--significantly higher than proportions in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Key messages from CBT can be delivered by mobile phone, and young people report that these are helpful. Change in clinician-rated depression symptom scores from baseline to 12 months, yet to be completed, will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the intervention. If proven effective, this form of delivery may be useful in many countries lacking widespread mental health services but with extensive mobile phone coverage.

10.1016/j.invent.2022.100558,An Internet-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) in adults: A multiple-baseline single-case experimental design study,"Tur C, Campos D, Suso-Ribera C, Kazlauskas E, Castilla D, Zaragoza I, García-Palacios A, Quero S.",Internet Interv,2022,2022.7.22,,,"The death of a loved one has physical, psychological, and social consequences. Between 9.8 and 21.5 % of people who lose a loved one develop Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Internet- and computer-based interventions (i.e., Internet-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, iCBT) are cost-effective and scalable alternatives that make it possible to reach more people with PGD. The main goal of the present investigation was to examine the effect and feasibility (usability and satisfaction) of an iCBT (GROw program) for adults with PGD. A secondary objective was to detect adherence to the app (Emotional Monitor) used to measure daily grief symptoms. The study had a single-case multiple-baseline AB design with six participants. The GROw program is organized sequentially in eight modules, and it is based on the dual-process model of coping with bereavement. Evaluations included a pre-to-post treatment assessment of depression, grief symptoms, and typical grief beliefs, along with daily measures of symptom frequency and intensity on the Emotional Monitor App. Treatment opinions and adherence to the App were also collected. Efficacy data were calculated using a Nonoverlap of All Pairs (NAP) analysis and Reliable Change Index (RCI). The mean age of the sample was 29.5 years (SD = 8.19). Two participants dropped out of the study. Adherence to the App varied across patients (4.8 % -77.8 %). Most participants (75 %) showed a clinically significant change (recovered) in depression, and 50 % obtained a clinically significant improvement (recovered) in symptoms of loss and typical beliefs in complicated grief. The participants reported high usability and satisfaction with the treatment content and format. In sum, the GROw program was very well accepted and generally feasible, and it has strong potential for treating PGD. The results support scaling up the treatment by using more complex designs with larger samples (i.e., randomized controlled trials comparing GROw with active conditions)."

Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is the first-line treatment, limited accessibility leaves many older adults with few effective treatment options. This study assessed the efficacy of digital CBT (dCBT) for treating insomnia, anxiety, and depression symptoms in adults aged 65 and older. METHOD: Data from three published randomized controlled trials of dCBT for insomnia (Sleepio) versus controls were combined for those aged 65+ with insomnia disorder (N = 315). Insomnia, anxiety, and depression scores were standardized into z-scores for comparison. Mixed-effects models estimated the treatment effect on insomnia, depression, and anxiety outcomes at post-treatment (8-10 wk) and follow-up (24 wk). Chi-squared tests of Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI-8) scores evaluated post-treatment insomnia remission rates between groups. RESULTS: Compared with controls, dCBT generated significantly greater improvements at post-treatment and follow-up in insomnia (gs ≤ -1.88, ps < 0.001) and depression (gs ≤ -0.44, ps ≤ 0.001) and significantly greater improvements in anxiety at post-treatment (g = -0.33, p < 0.001). dCBT generated higher post-treatment insomnia remission rates (60% vs. 16%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: dCBT can effectively improve symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression in adults aged 65+. Digital CBT may serve as an accessible means for older adults to receive guideline-concordant treatment at scale and avoid adverse side effects from common pharmacologic interventions."

Physical activity and sleep are also important for contextualizing mood data but can be difficult to track manually and rely on retrospective recall. Smartwatches could enhance self-monitoring by addressing difficulties in recall of sleep and physical activity and reducing the burden on patients in terms of remembering to track and the effort of tracking. This feasibility study will explore the acceptance of a smartwatch app for self-monitoring of mood, sleep, and physical activity, in an internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression offered in a routine care setting. METHODS: Seventy participants will be randomly allocated to (i) iCBT intervention plus smartwatch app or (ii) iCBT intervention alone. Patient acceptance will be measured longitudinally using a theory-based acceptance questionnaire to understand and compare the evolution of acceptance of the technology-delivered self-report in the two groups. A post-treatment interview will explore participants subjective experience of using the smartwatch. Engagement with the intervention, including self-report, and clinical outcomes, will be measured across both groups to assess for any differences. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study investigating the evolution of patient acceptance of smartwatch self-report in an iCBT delivered intervention in a clinical sample. Through an engaging and convenient means of capturing ecologically valid mood data, the study has the potential to show that smartwatches are an acceptable means for patient self-monitoring within iCBT interventions for depression and support potential use-cases for smartwatches in the context of mental health interventions in general.

10.2196/39787,Waiting Lists for Psychotherapy and Provider Attitudes Toward Low-Intensity Treatments as Potential Interventions: Survey Study,"Peipert A, Krendl AC, Lorenzo-Luaces L.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.9.16,,,"BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders, including depression and anxiety, are leading causes of disability worldwide. Digital mental health interventions, such as web-based self-help and other low-intensity treatments (LITs) that are not digital (eg, bibliotherapy), have the potential to reach many individuals by circumventing common barriers present in traditional mental health care. It is unclear how often LITs are used in clinical practice, or whether providers would be interested in their use for treatment waiting lists. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) describe current practices for treatment waiting lists, (2) describe providers' attitudes toward digital and nondigital LITs for patients on a waiting list, and (3) explore providers' willingness to use digital and nondigital LITs and their decisions to learn about them. METHODS: We surveyed 141 practicing mental health care providers (eg, therapists and psychologists) and provided an opportunity for them to learn about LITs. RESULTS: Most participants reported keeping a waiting list. Few participants reported currently recommending digital or nondigital LITs, though most were willing to use at least one for patients on their waiting list. Attitudes toward digital and nondigital LITs were neutral to positive. Guided digital and nondigital LITs were generally perceived to be more effective but less accessible, and unguided interventions were perceived to be less effective but more accessible. Most participants selected to access additional information on LITs, with the most popular being web-based self-help. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest providers are currently not recommending LITs for patients on treatment waiting lists but would be willing to recommend them. Future work should explore barriers and facilitators to implementing digital and nondigital LITs for patients on treatment waiting lists."
10.2196/67682,AI Chatbots for Psychological Health for Health Professionals: Scoping Review,"Baek G, Cha C, Han JH.",JMIR Hum Factors,2025,2025.3.19,,,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals face significant psychological burdens including burnout, anxiety, and depression. These can negatively impact their well-being and patient care. Traditional psychological health interventions often encounter limitations such as a lack of accessibility and privacy. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are being explored as potential solutions to these challenges, offering available and immediate support. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the characteristics and effectiveness of AI chatbots designed specifically for health professionals. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to evaluate the existing literature on the use of AI chatbots for psychological health support among health professionals. METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across eight databases, covering studies published before 2024, including backward and forward citation tracking and manual searching from the included studies. Studies were screened for relevance based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, among 2465 studies retrieved, 10 studies met the criteria for review. RESULTS: Among the 10 studies, six chatbots were delivered via mobile platforms, and four via web-based platforms, all enabling one-on-one interactions. Natural language processing algorithms were used in six studies and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques were applied to psychological health in four studies. Usability was evaluated in six studies through participant feedback and engagement metrics. Improvements in anxiety, depression, and burnout were observed in four studies, although one reported an increase in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: AI chatbots show potential tools to support the psychological health of health professionals by offering personalized and accessible interventions. Nonetheless, further research is required to establish standardized protocols and validate the effectiveness of these interventions. Future studies should focus on refining chatbot designs and assessing their impact on diverse health professionals."

This study is part of a multi-phased project aimed at adapting a depression prevention DHI for Jordanian adolescents. It evaluated the feasibility, cultural acceptability, and effectiveness of the translated and culturally adapted DHI, named Al-Khaizuran, with comparisons to school-based group CBT. METHODS: A two-arm, single-blind randomized controlled trial with a mixed-methods design was conducted among 109 Jordanian adolescents aged 15-17 years experiencing mild to moderate depression. Participants were randomly assigned to either Al-Khaizuran DHI (n=55) or school-based group CBT (n=54). The adaptation of Al-Khaizuran DHI components was guided by the Ecological Validity Framework, while the procedural adaptation followed Barrera and Castro's Heuristic Framework, incorporating iterative refinement based on user feedback and contextual considerations. RESULTS: Al-Khaizuran DHI was found to be a culturally relevant and acceptable intervention for Jordanian adolescent. Over half of the participants reported that the intervention was effective, empowering, and easy to use, with 51% expressing satisfaction and willingness to recommend it. However, challenges such as limited access to personal devices, privacy concerns, and participants' reliance on shared family resources emerged as significant barriers to consistent engagement. Participants showed a preference for individualized, blended interventions, with a significant reduction in support for group CBT. No significant difference was found in depression scores between the two groups. However, the Al-Khaizuran DHI group demonstrated higher post-intervention resilience scores (p=0.026). Beliefs about the effectiveness of the intervention significantly predicted behavioral intention (p=0.022), while perceived difficulty was a barrier to adherence (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Al-Khaizuran DHI exemplifies the potential of culturally adapted digital interventions in bridging mental health care gaps in resource-limited settings. However, its effectiveness is contingent upon addressing barriers to access, enhancing program interactivity, and integrating hybrid support systems that combine digital tools with in-person guidance. Future implementations should consider strategies to actively engage parents to foster a supportive environment that promotes the well-being of adolescents.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization reported that 80% of new HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014 occurred in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania has a particularly high HIV incidence, AIDS prevalence, and number of related deaths. HIV incidence in Romania is largely attributed to sexual contact among gay and bisexual men. However, homophobic stigma in Romania serves as a risk factor for HIV infection for gay and bisexual men. The Comunică intervention aims to provide a much-needed HIV risk reduction strategy, and it entails the delivery of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy skills across 8 live text-based counseling sessions on a mobile platform to gay and bisexual men at risk of HIV. The intervention is based on the information-motivation-behavior and minority stress models. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that Comunică holds promise for reducing gay and bisexual men's co-occurring sexual (eg, HIV transmission risk behavior), behavioral (eg, heavy alcohol use), and mental (eg, depression) health risks in Romania. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of Comunică in a national trial. METHODS: To test Comunică's efficacy, 305 gay and bisexual men were randomized to receive Comunică or a content-matched education attention control condition. The control condition consisted of 8 time-matched educational modules that present information regarding gay and bisexual men's identity development, information about HIV transmission and prevention, the importance of HIV and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, heavy alcohol use and its associations with HIV transmission risk behavior, sexual health communication, finding social support, and creating sexual health goals. Participants undergo rapid HIV and syphilis testing and 3-site chlamydia and gonorrhea testing at baseline and the 12-month follow-up. Outcomes are measured before the intervention (baseline) and at the 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: The study was funded in September 2018, and data collection began in May 2019. The last participant follow-up was in January 2024. Currently, the data analyst is cleaning data sets in preparation for data analyses, which are scheduled to begin in April 2024. Data analysis meetings are scheduled regularly to establish timelines and examine the results as analyses are gradually being conducted. Upon completion, a list of manuscripts will be reviewed and prioritized, and the team will begin preparing them for publication. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to test the efficacy of an intervention with the potential to simultaneously support the sexual, behavioral, and mental health of gay and bisexual men in Central and Eastern Europe using motivational interviewing support and sensitivity to the high-stigma context of the region. If efficacious, Comunică presents a scalable platform to provide support to gay and bisexual men living in Romania and similar high-stigma, low-resource countries.

10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2024.12.022,Effectiveness of information technology-based cognitive behavioral therapy on depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Qiu Y, Wu M, Liu J, Li C, Yu Y, Zeng L, Yang F, Zhang X, Chen G.",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,2025,2025.1.6,,,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent among older adults. However, most older adults have poor access to age-specific mental health services. While Information technology-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) has shown promise as an accessible alternative to face-to-face interventions, its effectiveness specifically within the older adults warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of ICBT on depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults. METHODS: Research articles retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE from inception to April 10, 2024, were reviewed. The search was designed to identify Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy of ICBT in reducing self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms in older adults. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, version 2.0. Posttreatment means and standard deviations (SDs) were compared between intervention and control groups, and pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 11 RCTs were eligible for inclusion in this review. Compared to control groups, ICBT yielded small to medium post-treatment pooled effect sizes regarding depressive symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.65, 95 % CI -0.95 to -0.35; P < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.47, 95 % CI -0.74 to -0.19; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that: (1) interventions lasting ≥8 weeks (Hedges' g = -0.88, 95 % CI -1.37 to -0.39; P < 0.001) were more effective than <8 weeks for depressive symptoms; however, <8 weeks (Hedges' g = -0.52, 95 % CI -0.93 to -0.10; P = 0.014) was more effective for anxiety symptoms; (2) ICBT delivered through slideshows was more effective than through other digital platforms for both depressive (Hedges' g = -1.36, 95 % CI -2.40 to -0.31; P = 0.011) and anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = -1.00, 95 % CI -1.30 to -0.70; P < 0.001); and (3) non-tailored ICBT was more effective than tailored versions for both depressive (Hedges' g = -1.06, 95 % CI -2.03 to -0.09; P = 0.032) and anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.70, 95 % CI -1.14 to -0.27; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis reinforces the effectiveness of ICBT in relieving depression and anxiety symptoms among older adults. Future research should identify the most effective components of ICBT to optimize their development."

BT may improve access to treatment, therapy uptake, and adherence. However, research is scarce on the structure of BT models. OBJECTIVE: We synthesized the literature to describe BT models used for the treatment of psychological disorders in adults. We investigated whether BT structure, content, and ratio affected treatment efficacy, uptake, and adherence. We also conducted meta-analyses to examine treatment efficacy in intervention-control dyads and associations between treatment outcomes versus BT model structure. METHODS: PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, and MEDLINE databases were searched. Eligibility criteria included articles published in English till March 2023 that described digital and face-to-face elements as part of an intervention plan for treating psychological disorders in adult patients. We developed a coding framework to characterize the BT interventions. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate effect size (ES; Cohen d and 95% CIs) regarding pre- and posttreatment outcomes in depression and anxiety versus BT structure. The review was registered with PROSPERO and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. RESULTS: Searches identified 8436 articles, and data were extracted from 29 studies. BT interventions were analyzed and classified according to mode of interaction between digital and face-to-face components (integrated vs sequential), role of the components (core vs supplementary), component delivery (alternate vs case-by-case), and digital materials assignment mode (standardized vs personalized). Most BT interventions (n=24) used a cognitive behavioral therapy approach for anxiety or depression treatment. Mean rates of uptake (91%) and adherence (81%) were reported across individual studies. BT interventions were more effective or noninferior to treatment as usual, with large spread in the data and a moderate to large ES in the treatment of depression (n=9; Cohen d=-1.1, 95% CI -0.6 to -1.6, P<.001, and z score=-4.3). A small, nonsignificant ES was found for anxiety outcomes (n=5; Cohen d=-0.1, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.05, P=.17, and z score=-1.4). Higher ESs were found in blended interventions with supplementary design (depression: n=11, Cohen d=-0.75, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.95; anxiety: n=8, Cohen d=-0.9, 95% CI -0.6 to -1.2); fewer (≤6) face-to-face sessions (depression: n=9, Cohen d=-0.7, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.9; anxiety: n=7, Cohen d=-0.8, 95% CI -0.3 to -1.3); and a lower ratio (≤50%) of face-to-face versus digital sessions (depression: n=5, Cohen d=-0.8, 95% CI -0.6 to -1.1; anxiety: n=4, Cohen d=-0.8, 95% CI 0.006 to -1.6). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed integrated BT models as feasible to deliver. We found BT to be effective in depression treatment, but anxiety treatment results were nonsignificant. Future studies assessing outcomes across different psychological disorders and therapeutic approaches are required.

10.1016/j.sleep.2020.03.016,A randomized controlled trial of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in pregnant women,"Kalmbach DA, Cheng P, O'Brien LM, Swanson LM, Sangha R, Sen S, Guille C, Cuamatzi-Castelan A, Henry AL, Roth T, Drake CL.",Sleep Med,2020,2020.6.20,,,"OBJECTIVE: Despite high rates of prenatal insomnia, efficacious treatment options for this population are quite limited. Early evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the efficacy of face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for prenatal insomnia. Yet, as many patients are unable to access this specialist-driven care, a critical need exists to increase its accessibility. This RCT examined the efficacy internet-based digital CBTI in pregnant women with insomnia. METHODS: Single-site RCT. A total of 91 pregnant women (29.03 ± 4.16 years) nearing/entering the third trimester who screened positive for clinical insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were randomized to digital CBTI or digital sleep education control. The ISI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale's Cognitive factor (PSAS-C) served as study outcomes, which were collected before treatment and after treatment during pregnancy, then six weeks after childbirth. RESULTS: From pre to posttreatment, CBTI patients reported reductions in ISI (-4.91 points, p < 0.001) and PSQI (-2.98 points, p < 0.001) and increases in nightly sleep duration by 32 min (p = 0.008). Sleep symptoms did not change during pregnancy in the control group. After childbirth, CBTI patients, relative to controls, slept longer by 40 min per night (p = 0.01) and reported better sleep maintenance. No pre or postnatal treatment effects on depression or cognitive arousal were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBTI improves sleep quality and sleep duration during pregnancy and after childbirth. To better optimize outcomes, CBTI should be tailored to meet the changing needs of women as the progress through pregnancy and early parenting.

10.5498/wjp.v11.i4.133,Effectiveness of digital psychotherapeutic intervention among perinatal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Lau Y, Cheng JY, Wong SH, Yen KY, Cheng LJ.",World J Psychiatry,2021,2021.4.23,,,"BACKGROUND: The perinatal period is a challenging time of substantial emotional, physiological, social, and relational changes. Depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms are common, and co-exist in the perinatal period. Digital technology continues to grow at an unprecedented pace with wide application, including psychotherapeutic intervention. A growing number of meta-analyses supported the application of digital psychotherapeutic intervention across different populations, but relatively few meta- and meta-regression analyses have concentrated on perinatal women. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of digital psychotherapeutic intervention on improving psychological outcomes among perinatal women and identify its essential features. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were obtained from eight databases, including Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses from inception up until November 24, 2020. Comprehensive Meta-analysis 3.0 software was used to conduct meta- and meta-regression analyses. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Grading of the Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system were adopted to assess the individual and overall qualities of the evidence, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 25 RCTs that included 3239 women were identified. Meta-analyses revealed that intervention significantly improved depression (Hedges's g = 0.49), anxiety (g = 0.25), and stress (g = 0.47) symptoms compared to the control. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that a website platform with ≥ eight therapist-guided sessions using the theoretical principle of cognitive behavioral therapy was more effective than other treatments in improving depression symptoms in postnatal women. Meta-regression analyses observed that the age of perinatal women and the type of psychotherapy also had statistically significant effects on depression symptoms. Egger's regression asymmetry tests suggested that no publication biases occurred, but the overall quality of the evidence was very low. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that digital psychotherapeutic intervention may be a potential solution to reduce psychological problems in perinatal women. Further high-quality RCTs with large sample sizes are needed."

Traditional treatments for insomnia include pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but these options may not be accessible to everyone who needs treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the app-based Headspace Sleep Program in adults with clinical insomnia on sleep disturbance and mental health outcomes, compared with a waitlist control group. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 132 adults with clinical insomnia who were assigned to either the Headspace Sleep Program (an 18-session self-guided, in-app program utilizing CBT-I techniques augmented by mindfulness) or a waitlist control group. Sleep disturbance outcomes were assessed by changes in insomnia symptoms (measured using the Insomnia Severity Index) and sleep efficiency (measured via sleep diary and actigraphy). Mental health outcomes included perceived stress (measured by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale), depressive symptoms (measured by the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire), sleep quality (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), anxiety symptoms (measured by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), and mindfulness (measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale). Changes from baseline to postintervention and follow-up were assessed for each outcome. RESULTS: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 37.2 (10.6) years, with 69 out of 132 (52.3%) identifying as female. Those randomized to the Headspace Sleep Program group experienced significantly greater improvements in insomnia symptoms from baseline to postintervention and follow-up compared with participants in the waitlist control group (P<.001, η²p=0.107). Improvements from baseline to postintervention and follow-up were also observed in the Headspace Sleep Program group for sleep efficiency, as measured by both sleep diary (P=.01, η²p=.03) and actigraphy outcomes (P=.01, η²p=.03). Participants in the Headspace Sleep Program group showed greater improvements in insomnia remission rates (8/66, 12%, at postintervention and 9/66, 14%, at follow-up) and treatment response (11/66, 17%, at postintervention and 15/66, 23%, at follow-up) compared with the control group (remission rate 2/66, 3%, at postintervention and 0/66, 0%, at follow-up; treatment response 3/66, 5%, at postintervention and 1/66, 2%, at follow-up). The results suggest significant improvements in depressive symptoms (P=.01, η²p=.04), anxiety symptoms (P=.02, η²p=.02), and mindfulness (P=.01, η²p=.03) in the Headspace Sleep Program group. CONCLUSIONS: The Headspace Sleep Program is an effective intervention for improving sleep disturbances in adults with clinical insomnia.

AIMS: Evaluating changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety after supported digital cognitive behavioural therapy (dCBT) for insomnia delivered via a community-based provider (Self Help Manchester) of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service. METHOD: Supported dCBT for insomnia was delivered to 98 clients (mean age 44.9 years, SD 15.2, 66% female) of Self Help Manchester. All clients received six support calls from an eTherapy coordinator to support the self-help dCBT. During these calls levels of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7) were determined. RESULTS: Depression (M difference-5.7, t(70) = 12.5, p < .001) and anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), M difference-4.1, t(70) = 8.0, p < .001] were reduced following supported dCBT for insomnia. This translated into an IAPT recovery rate of 68% for depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dCBT for insomnia alleviates depression and anxiety in clients presenting with mental health complaints in routine healthcare."
10.1016/j.invent.2023.100646,Use of tailoring features and reasons for dropout in a guided internet-based transdiagnostic individually-tailored cognitive behavioral therapy for symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in college students,"Ciharova M, Cuijpers P, Amanvermez Y, Riper H, Klein AM, Bolinski F, de Wit LM, van der Heijde CM, Bruffaerts R, Struijs S, Wiers RW, Karyotaki E.",Internet Interv,2023,2023.12.15,,,"Transdiagnostic individually-tailored digital interventions reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in adults with moderate effects. However, research into these approaches for college students is scarce and contradicting. In addition, the exact reasons for intervention dropout in this target group are not well known, and the use of individually-tailored intervention features, such as optional modules, has not yet been explored. The current study aimed to (1) investigate reasons for dropout from a guided internet-based transdiagnostic individually-tailored intervention for college students assessed in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and (2) evaluate whether participants used tailoring features intended for their baseline symptoms. A sample of college students with mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety symptoms (n = 48) in the Netherlands (partially) followed a guided internet-based transdiagnostic individually-tailored intervention. We contacted those who did not complete the entire intervention (n = 29) by phone to report the reasons for intervention dropout. Further, we descriptively explored the use of tailoring features (i.e., depression versus anxiety trajectory) and optional modules of the intervention in the whole sample. We identified a range of person- and intervention-related reasons for intervention dropout, most commonly busy schedules, needs for different kinds of help, or absence of personal contact. Furthermore, only less than half of the participants used the individually-tailoring features to address the symptoms they reported as predominant. In conclusion, digital interventions clear about the content and targeted symptoms, tested in user research could prevent dropout and create reasonable expectations of the intervention. Participants would benefit from additional guidance when using tailoring features of digital interventions, as they often do not choose the tailoring features targeting their baseline symptoms."
10.1002/da.22649,Ecological momentary interventions for depression and anxiety,"Schueller SM, Aguilera A, Mohr DC.",Depress Anxiety,2017,2017.5.12,,,"Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are becoming more popular and more powerful resources for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety due to advances in technological capacity and analytic sophistication. Previous work has demonstrated that EMIs can be effective at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as related outcomes of stress and at increasing positive psychological functioning. In this review, we highlight the differences between EMIs and other forms of treatment due to the nature of EMIs to be deeply integrated into the fabric of people's day-to-day lives. EMIs require unique considerations in their design, deployment, and evaluation. Furthermore, given that EMIs have been advanced by changes in technologies and that the use of behavioral intervention technologies for mental health has been increasing, we discuss how technologies and analytics might usher in a new era of EMIs. Future EMIs might reduce user burden and increase intervention personalization and sophistication by leveraging digital sensors and advances in natural language processing and machine learning. Thus, although current EMIs are effective, the EMIs of the future might be more engaging, responsive, and adaptable to different people and different contexts."

Baseline self-ratings on the reduced version of the Horne-Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire were used to categorize the sample into three chronotypes: morning type (n = 345; 20%); intermediate type (n = 843; 49%); and evening type (n = 524; 30%). Insomnia Severity Index, Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were assessed pre- and post-intervention (9 weeks). For individuals with self-reported morning or intermediate chronotypes, digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was superior to patient education on all ratings (Insomnia Severity Index, Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at follow-up (p-values ≤ 0.05). For individuals with self-reported evening chronotype, digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia was superior to patient education for Insomnia Severity Index and Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, but not on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (p = 0.139). There were significant differences in the treatment effects between the three chronotypes on the Insomnia Severity Index (p = 0.023) estimated difference between evening and morning type of -1.70, 95% confidence interval: -2.96 to -0.45, p = 0.008, and estimated difference between evening and intermediate type -1.53, 95% confidence interval: -3.04 to -0.03, p = 0.046. There were no significant differences in the treatment effects between the three chronotypes on the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (p = 0.488) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (p = 0.536). We conclude that self-reported chronotype moderates the effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on insomnia severity, but not on psychological distress or fatigue."

The present review evaluated the effectiveness of CBT in stressful conditions among clinical and general populations, and identified recent advances in CBT-related techniques. A search of the literature for studies conducted during 1987-2021 identified 345 articles relating to biopsychosocial medicine; 154 (45%) were review articles, including 14 systemic reviews, and 53 (15%) were clinical trials including 45 randomized controlled trials. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that CBT was effective for a variety of mental problems (e.g., anxiety disorder, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression, hypochondriasis), physical conditions (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, breast cancer), and behavioral problems (e.g., antisocial behaviors, drug abuse, gambling, overweight, smoking), at least in the short term; more follow-up observations are needed to assess the long-term effects of CBT. Mental and physical problems can likely be managed effectively with online CBT or self-help CBT using a mobile app, but these should be applied with care, considering their cost-effectiveness and applicability to a given population."

The aim of this research was to study whether a mobile, unguided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based Intervention for sleep problems, Sleep2, is feasible, acceptable, and potentially able to reduce mental health/sleep problems symptoms. METHODS: A single-arm, open-label, uncontrolled pre-post evaluation study was conducted with 487 registered participants: 283 started, 160 (56.55%) finished, out of which 95 completed without an ambulatory heart rate (HR) sensor and 65 with. Assessments were conducted through online questionnaires and objective measurements via HR sensors. Besides feasibility and acceptability, outcome measures included symptoms in several mental health domains alongside self-reported and objectively reported sleep parameter. RESULTS: Engagement with the Sleep2 app was high, achieving an 80.72% compliance rate, alongside high levels of feasibility and acceptance. Participants reported significant pre-post reductions in the severity of symptoms, with sleep problems decreasing by 22.60% (Cohen's d = 0.53), insomnia by 35.08% (d = 0.69), fear of sleep by 32.43% (d = 0.25), anxiety by 27.72% (d = 0.48), depression by 28.67% (d = 0.52), PTSD by 32.41% (d = 0.51), somatic symptoms by 24.52% (d = 0.51), and perceived stress by 17.90% (d = 0.39). Objective sleep measurements showed a significant reduction in sleep onset latency only. CONCLUSION: The 'Sleep2Ukraine' program demonstrated high feasibility and acceptance, with significant improvements in subjective sleep and mental health measures among participants. However, given the study's uncontrolled design and reliance on self-selected participants, these findings should be considered preliminary. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Nonetheless, the results highlight the potential of culturally adapted, scalable, mobile-based CBT-I interventions to address sleep and mental health needs in war-affected populations."

Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) enables large-scale dissemination at low costs. Evidence suggests that ICBT can reduce stress in subclinical and mixed diagnostic samples, but less is known about the effect of ICBT in targeted samples suffering from elevated perceived stress or stress-related disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of ICBT specifically aimed at reducing stress in adults with elevated perceived stress or stress-related disorders. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing ICBT with a control group in PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo between 2010 and 2021. A meta-analysis of 14 comparisons (total N = 1831) was performed, and Cohen's d was calculated to assess the difference between intervention and control groups at posttest for the primary outcome self-rated stress. Effects on secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression were also investigated. RESULTS: The pooled mean effect size for self-rated stress at posttest was d = 0.78 [CI 95 % 0.66-0.90]. For anxiety and depression, the effects were d = 0.69 [95 % CI 0.52-0.86] and d = 0.65 [95 % CI 0.56-0.75] respectively. The heterogeneity of results between studies was overall low to moderate. Subgroup analyses were not conducted due to the limited number of studies eligible for inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence of the efficacy of ICBT to reduce stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in adults suffering from elevated stress or stress-related disorders.

The current paper provides an empirical example of the use of the engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to build a remotely delivered responsive parenting intervention to prevent obesity among children of low-income mothers with and without depressive symptoms. METHODS: Participants were 107 mothers with (n = 45) and without (n = 62) depressive symptoms who had a child aged 12 to 42 months participating in the Women, Infants and Children program. Participants were randomized to one of sixteen experimental conditions using a factorial design that included a combination of the following eight remotely delivered intervention components: responsive feeding curriculum (given to all participants), parenting curriculum, portion size guidance, obesogenic risk assessment, personalized feedback on mealtime routines, feeding curriculum counseling, goal setting, mobile messaging, and social support. This design enabled efficient identification of components with low feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS: Completion rates were high (85%) and did not statistically differ by depressive symptoms. However, mothers with depressive symptoms who received obesogenic risk assessment and personalized feedback on mealtime routines components had lower completion rates than mothers without depressive symptoms. All intervention components were feasible to implement except the social support component. Regardless of experimental condition, most participants reported that the program increased their awareness of what, when, and how to feed their children. CONCLUSIONS: MOST provided an efficient way to assess the feasibility of components prior to testing them with a fully powered experiment. This framework helped identify potentially challenging combinations of remotely delivered intervention components. Consideration of how these results can inform future studies focused on the optimization phase of MOST is discussed."

Traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approaches are less effective for delusions, require significant resources, and specialized staff training. Symptom-specific therapy approaches, which target factors involved in the development and maintenance of psychotic symptoms, provide a valid alternative. Recent research demonstrates the efficacy of coping strategies as an intervention element, however, so far, only in the context of auditory hallucinations. Digital technologies, such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI), are gaining attention in mental health, providing enhanced assessment and intervention opportunities. The present single-arm trial aimed to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a smartphone-based blended EMA/I psychological therapy approach focusing on improving coping strategies for delusions in SSD. In total, N = 10 participants received four face-to-face therapy sessions alongside German university-level treatment-as-usual over an intervention period of four to six weeks. Feasibility was assessed by completion rates of the EMA/I questionnaires, use of the application between sessions and recruitment rates. Acceptability was assessed by a satisfaction questionnaire, open feedback, and analysis of adverse effects. Clinical outcomes included self-rated and rater-based intensity and distress of delusions and comorbid symptoms at pre- and post-intervention. Findings supported the feasibility and acceptability of the DICE (DICE - Delusion Ideation in the Context of Everyday life intervention) intervention, with high retention (10/13 participants, 77 %) and completion rates for the EMA- (59 %) and EMI-questionnaires (72 %), as well as a high protocol adherence (90-97 %), exceeding all predefined benchmarks. Open feedback indicated good satisfaction, with all participants using the application between sessions, reflecting a high engagement level. Clinical outcomes displayed relevant changes in ameliorating the intensity of delusions when being measured by the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales as well as by the Green Paranoid Thought Scale, and self-rated improvements in distress and depressive symptoms. Changes in the intensity and distress of delusions might be explained by improved coping behaviour. Further research with control conditions is needed to validate findings and analyze the efficacy as well as mechanisms of actions of the intervention in a fully powered trial."

We have developed an app that allows a peer with no prior experience of health-care delivery to deliver the cognitive therapy-based intervention for perinatal depression, the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP). This trial aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this Technology-assisted peer-delivered THP versus standard face-to-face Thinking Healthy Programme delivered by trained health workers. METHODS: We will employ a non-inferiority stratified cluster randomized controlled trial design comparing the two formats of intervention delivery. A total of 980 women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode, evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V Disorders (SCID), will be recruited into the trial. The unit of randomization will be 70 village clusters randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms. The primary outcome is defined as remission from major depressive episode at 3 months postnatal measured with the SCID. Data will also be collected on symptoms of anxiety, disability, quality of life, service use and costs, and infant-related outcomes such as exclusive breastfeeding and immunization rates. Data will be collected on the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes (depression and anxiety scores, exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 months postnatal to evaluate if the improvements are sustained in the longer-term. We are especially interested in sustained improvement (recovery) from major depressive episode. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a technology-assisted peer-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention in rural Pakistan. If shown to be effective, the novel delivery format could play a role in reducing the treatment gap for perinatal depression and other common mental disorders in LMIC.

The aim of this study was to conduct an exploratory examination on the acceptability of an interactive computerized cognitive behavior therapy program to reduce depressive symptoms for adults in a rural Western state. Partnering with the land-grant university Extension system and a state non-profit organization, we identified and interviewed 18 key informants and conducted 19 focus groups in 15 rural communities to ascertain attitudes and perspectives about the program. Key informants were provided access to the Thrive program prior to the interviews. Focus group participants were provided a brief demonstration of the program and asked to provide feedback. Content analyses of interview and focus group transcripts yielded four general themes of program acceptability: privacy, accessibility, user-friendliness, and cultural inappropriateness. Overall, participants indicated that the Thrive program would be useful for many in their communities. They also reported that the program could be improved by making videos that better represent rural community members' lifestyles and experiences. The study team members acted on these findings to improve the Thrive program for rural Western populations."

However, social distancing has negative consequences, including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital interventions, such as text messaging, can provide accessible support on a population-wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the effect of our 60-day text messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess whether the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time windows. METHODS: The messages were designed within two different categories: behavioral activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into (1) a random messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal probabilities, and (2) a reinforcement learning arm, with a learned decision mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood ratings; self-reported depression, using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire; and self-reported anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale at baseline and at intervention completion. RESULTS: The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California Berkeley approved this study in April 2020 (No. 2020-04-13162). Data collection began in April 2020 and will run to April 2021. As of August 24, 2020, we have enrolled 229 participants.

10.2196/33337,Digitalized Cognitive Behavioral Interventions for Depressive Symptoms During Pregnancy: Systematic Review,"Wan Mohd Yunus WMA, Matinolli HM, Waris O, Upadhyaya S, Vuori M, Korpilahti-Leino T, Ristkari T, Koffert T, Sourander A.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.2.23,,,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown a high prevalence of depression during pregnancy, and there is also evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychosocial interventions. Emerging evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has shown that technology has been successfully harnessed to provide CBT interventions for other populations. However, very few studies have focused on their use during pregnancy. This approach has become increasingly important in many clinical areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our study aimed to expand the knowledge in this particular clinical area. OBJECTIVE: Our systematic review aimed to bring together the available research-based evidence on digitalized CBT interventions for depression symptoms during pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EBSCO Open Dissertations databases was carried out from the earliest available evidence to October 27, 2021. Only RCT studies published in English were considered. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed, and the protocol was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. RESULTS: The review identified 7 studies from 5 countries (the United States, China, Australia, Norway, and Sweden) published from 2015 to 2021. The sample sizes ranged from 25 to 1342 participants. The interventions used various technological elements, including text, images, videos, games, interactive features, and peer group discussions. They comprised 2 guided and 5 unguided approaches. Using digitalized CBT interventions for depression during pregnancy showed promising efficacy, with guided intervention showing higher effect sizes (Hedges g=1.21) than the unguided interventions (Hedges g=0.14-0.99). The acceptability of the digitalized CBT interventions was highly encouraging, based on user feedback. Attrition rates were low for the guided intervention (4.5%) but high for the unguided interventions (22.1%-46.5%). A high overall risk of bias was present for 6 of the 7 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our search only identified a small number of digitalized CBT interventions for pregnant women, despite the potential of this approach. These showed promising evidence when it came to efficacy and positive outcomes for depression symptoms, and user feedback was positive. However, the overall risk of bias suggests that the efficacy of the interventions needs to be interpreted with caution. Future studies need to consider how to mitigate these sources of biases. Digitalized CBT interventions can provide prompt, effective, evidence-based interventions for pregnant women. This review increases our understanding of the importance of digitalized interventions during pregnancy, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

10.1186/s12991-015-0077-8,Integrating technology into cognitive behavior therapy for adolescent depression: a pilot study,"Kobak KA, Mundt JC, Kennard B.",Ann Gen Psychiatry,2015,2015.11.5,,,"Erratum in Ann Gen Psychiatry. 2016 Jan 15;15:2. doi: 10.1186/s12991-015-0089-4. BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in information technology and telecommunications have resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of mobile devices and the internet to enhance and facilitate access to treatment. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an empirically based treatment that is well suited for enhancement by new technologies, particularly with youth. To facilitate the dissemination of this evidence-based treatment, we developed a technology-enhanced CBT intervention for the treatment of adolescent depression consisting of (1) online therapist training (2) in-session use of tablets for teaching clients CBT concepts and skills, and (3) text messaging for between session homework reminders and self-monitoring. METHODS: Eighteen licensed clinicians (social workers n = 7, psychologists n = 9) were randomized to have their patients receive either the intervention (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Each clinician treated four adolescents for 12 weeks. Clinicians in the CBT arm completed an online tutorial on CBT treatment of adolescent depression, then received an iPad with access to patient education materials for teaching CBT concepts to patients during sessions. Individualized text messages were integrated into treatment for homework reminders, support, and outcomes measurement. Outcome measures included a 49-item multiple choice test for tutorial effectiveness; the system usability scale (SUS) for user satisfaction; quick inventory of depressive symptomatology-adolescent version (QIDS-A-Pat); and clinician and patient ratings on the therapeutic alliance scale for adolescents (TASA). RESULTS: A significant increase in knowledge of CBT concepts was found after completing the tutorial, t(8) = 7.02, p < 0.001. Clinician and patient ratings of user satisfaction were high for both the iPad teaching tools, and the text messaging. Ninety-five percent of teens said reviewing their text messages with their therapist was helpful, and all said they would use text messaging in treatment again. Ratings of the therapeutic alliance were higher in the CBT arm t(131) = 4.03, p = 0.001. A significant reduction in depression was found in both groups [t(34) = 8.453, p < 0.001 and t(29) = 6.67, p < 0.001 for CBT and TAU, respectively). Clinical ratings of improvement were greater on all outcome measures for the CBT arm; however, none reached statistical significance. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranged from small (QIDS-A) to large (TASA). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the feasibility of this technology-enhanced CBT intervention as a means of improving CBT treatment of adolescent depression and may help address the critical shortage of therapists trained on empirically based treatments."
10.1111/dme.14227,How 25 years of psychosocial research has contributed to a better understanding of the links between depression and diabetes,"Pouwer F, Schram MT, Iversen MM, Nouwen A, Holt RIG.",Diabet Med,2020,2020.1.8,,,"This narrative review of the literature provides a summary and discussion of 25 years of research into the complex links between depression and diabetes. Systematic reviews have shown that depression occurs more frequently in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with people without diabetes. Currently, it remains unclear whether depression is also more common in people with impaired glucose metabolism or undiagnosed type 2 diabetes compared with people without diabetes. More prospective epidemiological research into the course of depression and an exploration of mechanisms in individuals with diabetes are needed. Depression in diabetes is associated with less optimal self-care behaviours, suboptimal glycaemic control, impaired quality of life, incident micro- and macrovascular diseases, and elevated mortality rates. Randomized controlled trails concluded that depression in diabetes can be treated with antidepressant medication, cognitive-behavioural therapy (individual, group-based or web-based), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and stepped care. Although big strides forward have been made in the past 25 years, scientific evidence about depression in diabetes remains incomplete. Future studies should investigate mechanisms that link both conditions and test new diabetes-specific web- or app-based interventions for depression in diabetes. It is important to determine whether treatment or prevention of depression prevents future diabetes complications and lowers mortality rates."
10.1016/j.brat.2023.104318,Effectiveness and implementation of a text messaging intervention to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms among Latinx and Non-Latinx white users during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Haro-Ramos AY, Rodriguez HP, Aguilera A.",Behav Res Ther,2023,2023.5.5,,,"Text messaging interventions are increasingly used to help people manage depression and anxiety. However, little is known about the effectiveness and implementation of these interventions among U.S. Latinxs, who often face barriers to using mental health tools. The StayWell at Home (StayWell) intervention, a 60-day text messaging program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), was developed to help adults cope with depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. StayWell users (n = 398) received daily mood inquiries and automated skills-based text messages delivering CBT-informed coping strategies from an investigator-generated message bank. We conduct a Hybrid Type 1 mixed-methods study to compare the effectiveness and implementation of StayWell for Latinx and Non-Latinx White (NLW) adults using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Effectiveness was measured using the PHQ-8 depression and GAD-7 anxiety scales, assessed before starting and after completing StayWell. Guided by RE-AIM, we conducted a thematic text analysis of responses to an open-ended question about user experiences to help contextualize quantitative findings. Approximately 65.8% (n = 262) of StayWell users completed pre-and-post surveys. On average, depressive (-1.48, p = 0.001) and anxiety (-1.38, p = 0.001) symptoms decreased from pre-to-post StayWell. Compared to NLW users (n = 192), Latinx users (n = 70) reported an additional -1.45 point (p < 0.05) decline in depressive symptoms, adjusting for demographics. Although Latinxs reported StayWell as relatively less useable (76.8 vs. 83.9, p = 0.001) than NLWs, they were more interested in continuing the program (7.5 vs. 6.2 out of 10, p = 0.001) and recommending it to a family member/friend (7.8 vs. 7.0 out of 10, p = 0.01). Based on the thematic analysis, both Latinx and NLW users enjoyed responding to mood inquiries and sought bi-directional, personalized text messages and texts with links to more information to resources. Only NLW users stated that StayWell provided no new information than they already knew from therapy or other sources. In contrast, Latinx users suggested that engagement with a behavioral provider through text or support groups would be beneficial, highlighting this group's unmet need for behavioral health care. mHealth interventions like StayWell are well-positioned to address population-level disparities by serving those with the greatest unmet needs if they are culturally adapted and actively disseminated to marginalized groups.

10.2196/47691,Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression Among Homebound Older Adults: Development and Usability Study,"Xiang X, Kayser J, Ash S, Zheng C, Sun Y, Weaver A, Dunkle R, Blackburn JA, Halavanau A, Xue J, Himle JA.",JMIR Aging,2023,2023.9.19,,,"BACKGROUND: Homebound older adults are a high-risk group for depression. However, many of them face barriers to accessing evidence-supported mental health treatments. Digital mental health interventions can potentially improve treatment access, but few web-based interventions are explicitly tailored for depression in older adults. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the development process of Empower@Home, a web-delivered intervention for depression in homebound older adults that is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, and reports on the outcomes of usability studies. METHODS: Empower@Home was developed in collaboration with community agencies, stakeholders, and older adults, guided by user-centered design principles. User needs were assessed through secondary data analysis, demographic and health profiles from administrative data, and interviews and surveys of community partners. A comparative usability evaluation was conducted with 10 older adults to assess the usability of Empower@Home compared to 2 similar programs. Field testing was conducted with 4 end users to detect additional usability issues. RESULTS: Feedback and recommendations from community partners heavily influenced the content and design of Empower@Home. The intervention consists of 9 sessions, including psychoeducation and an introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy skills and tools through short video clips, in-session exercises, an animated storyline, and weekly out-of-session home practice. A printed workbook accompanies the web-based lessons. In comparative usability testing (N=10), Empower@Home received a System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 7.4), which was significantly higher than the 2 comparator programs (t9=3.28; P=.005 and t9=2.78; P=.011). Most participants, 80% (n=8), preferred Empower@Home over the comparators. In the longitudinal field test (n=4), all participants reported liking the program procedures and feeling confident in performing program-related tasks. The single-subject line graph showed an overall downward trend in their depression scores over time, offering an encouraging indication of the intervention's potential effects. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration with community stakeholders and careful consideration of potential implementation issues during the design process can result in more usable, engaging, and effective digital mental health interventions."
10.1111/imj.16521,Digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia versus digital sleep education control in an Australian community-based sample: a randomised controlled trial,"Sweetman A, Reynolds C, Richardson C.",Intern Med J,2024,2024.9.11,,,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent condition in Australia that increases the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) is the recommended 'first line' treatment but is accessed by a minority of people with insomnia. AIMS: To improve CBT-i access in Australia, we aimed to develop and test a self-guided interactive digital CBT-i program. METHODS: An online randomised controlled trial was conducted from August 2022 to August 2023 to investigate the effect of digital CBT-i, versus digital sleep education control, on symptoms of insomnia (ISI), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), fatigue, sleepiness and maladaptive beliefs about sleep at 8-week follow-up. The control group accessed the intervention after the 8-week follow-up. Questionnaires were additionally administered at 16 and 24 weeks. Intent-to-treat mixed models and complete-case chi-squared analyses were used. RESULTS: Participants included 62 adults with insomnia symptoms (age M (SD) = 52.5 (16.3), 82% female, ISI = 18.6 (2.9)). There were no between-group differences in baseline characteristics or missing 8-week data (14.5%). After adjusting for baseline scores, CBT-i was associated with lower insomnia (Diffadj (95% CI) = 7.32 (5.0-9.6), P < 0.001, d = 1.64), depression (3.36 (1.3-5.4), p = 0.002, d = 0.84), fatigue (5.2 (2.5-7.9), P < 0.001, d = 1.00) and maladaptive beliefs about sleep (11.0 (4.1-18.0), P = 0.002, d = 0.82), but not anxiety symptoms at 8 weeks (1.84 (-0.1 to 3.8), p = 0.060, d = 0.50). Compared to control, CBT-i was associated with greater rates of insomnia remission (ISI <8; 0.0%, vs 40.0%, P < 0.001) and response at 8 weeks (ISI reduction ≥6; 7.1% vs 72.0%, P < 0.001). Improvements in insomnia and depression were maintained at 24 weeks in the CBT-i group. CONCLUSIONS: This interactive digital CBT-i program resulted in large and sustained improvements in symptoms of insomnia, depression, fatigue and maladaptive beliefs about sleep in Australian adults with insomnia symptoms. Implementation programs are required to increase digital CBT-i access and uptake."
10.1007/s10549-023-07228-z,Identification of patient subgroups who benefit from a behavioral intervention to improve adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence: a randomized-controlled trial,"Walsh EA, Post K, Massad K, Horick N, Antoni MH, Penedo FJ, Safren SA, Partridge AH, Peppercorn J, Park ER, Temel JS, Greer JA, Jacobs JM.",Breast Cancer Res Treat,2024,2024.1.17,,,"PURPOSE: Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) reduces breast cancer morbidity and mortality; however, adherence is suboptimal. Interventions exist, yet few have improved adherence. Patient characteristics may alter uptake of an intervention to boost adherence. We examined moderators of the effect of a virtual intervention (STRIDE; #NCT03837496) on AET adherence after breast cancer. METHODS: At a large academic medical center, patients taking AET (N = 100; Mage = 56.1, 91% White) were randomized to receive STRIDE versus medication monitoring. All stored their medication in digital pill bottles (MEMS Caps) which captured objective adherence. Participants self-reported adherence (Medication Adherence Report Scale) at 12 weeks post-baseline. Moderators included age, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), AET-related symptom distress (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Symptom Scale), and AET-specific concerns (Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire). We used hierarchical linear modeling (time × condition × moderator) and multiple regression (condition × moderator) to test the interaction effects on adherence. RESULTS: Age (B = 0.05, SE = 0.02, p = 0.003) and AET-related symptom distress (B = -0.04, SE = 0.02, p = 0.02) moderated condition effect on self-reported adherence while anxiety (B = -1.20, SE = 0.53, p = 0.03) and depressive symptoms (B = -1.65, SE = 0.65, p = 0.01) moderated objective adherence effects. AET-specific concerns approached significance (B = 0.91, SE = 0.57, p = 0.12). Participants who received STRIDE and were older or presented with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms or AET-related symptom distress exhibited improved adherence. Post hoc analyses revealed high correlations among most moderators. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients who received STRIDE exhibited improvements in AET adherence. The interrelatedness of moderators suggests an underlying profile of patients with lower symptom burden who benefitted most from the intervention. STUDY REGISTRATION: NCT03837496."
10.2196/15841,Efficacy of a Theory-Based Cognitive Behavioral Technique App-Based Intervention for Patients With Insomnia: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Rajabi Majd N, Broström A, Ulander M, Lin CY, Griffiths MD, Imani V, Ahorsu DK, Ohayon MM, Pakpour AH.",J Med Internet Res,2020,2020.4.3,,,"BACKGROUND: Sleep hygiene is important for maintaining good sleep and reducing insomnia. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among insomnia patients. METHODS: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n=156) or a control group that received only patient education (PE, n=156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring, behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in outcomes between the two groups and across time. RESULTS: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE group (P=.02 at 1 month, P=.04 at 3 months, and P=.02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of the intervention on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers might consider using a CBT-I app to improve sleep among insomnia patients.

10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033457,Effects of e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (eCBTI) to prevent the transition from acute insomnia to chronic insomnia: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Yang Y, Luo X, Paudel D, Zhang J, Li SX, Zhang B.",BMJ Open,2019,2019.11.20,,,"Erratum in BMJ Open. 2020 Dec 12;10(12):1-3. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033457corr1. INTRODUCTION: Previous evidence suggested that online self-guided sleep intervention is efficacious in improving treatment outcomes in patients with chronic insomnia [corrected]. However, research on online sleep interventions targeting acute insomnia [corrected] has been scarce. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of brief e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (eCBTI) in preventing transition from acute insomnia to chronic insomnia [corrected]. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic two-arm multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing eCBTI with treatment as usual (TAU) in outpatients. Two hundred patients with acute insomnia [corrected] (as defined by DSM-5) will be recruited. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive 1 week eCBTI via a Smartphone application, or to receive TAU. Treatment effects will be assessed at 1 week and 3 months after intervention. The primary outcome of the study, whether the eCBTI program is sufficient in preventing transition from short-term to chronic insomnia [corrected], is measured by the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary outcome measurements include the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale, Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test, Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale, Pre-sleep Arousal Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Additionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey will be used for measurement of mood symptoms and quality of life. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of Southern Medical University (reference number: NFEC-2017-131). The results of the investigation will be published in scientific papers. The data from the investigation will be made available online if necessary.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) effectively reduces both insomnia and depression severity, and can be delivered digitally. This could substantially increase the accessibility to CBT-I, which could reduce the health disparities related to insomnia; however, the efficacy of digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) across a range of demographic groups has not yet been adequately examined. This randomized placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy of dCBT-I in reducing both insomnia and depression across a wide range of demographic groups. METHODS: Of 1358 individuals with insomnia randomized, a final sample of 358 were retained in the dCBT-I condition and 300 in the online sleep education condition. Severity of insomnia and depression was examined as a dependent variable. Race, socioeconomic status (SES; household income and education), gender, and age were also tested as independent moderators of treatment effects. RESULTS: The dCBT-I condition yielded greater reductions in both insomnia and depression severity than sleep education, with significantly higher rates of remission following treatment. Demographic variables (i.e. income, race, sex, age, education) were not significant moderators of the treatment effects, suggesting that dCBT-I is comparably efficacious across a wide range of demographic groups. Furthermore, while differences in attrition were found based on SES, attrition did not differ between white and black participants. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence that the wide dissemination of dCBT-I may effectively target both insomnia and comorbid depression across a wide spectrum of the population."

Traditionally, treatments for methamphetamine use have been delivered in-person - however, lockdowns initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced access to such in-person support in prisons. Therefore, in May 2020 a digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for substance use disorders - 'Breaking Free from Substance Abuse' - was made available across prisons in Ohio in order to meet this treatment gap. This represents the first time this digital CBT intervention has been made widely available to incarcerated people residing in prisons or jails in the United States (US). This was a within-subjects study using data from 2187 Ohio prison residents who engaged with this digital CBT program to address their methamphetamine use. RESULTS: Participants reported multiple psychosocial risk factors, including moderate to severe substance dependence, depression and anxiety; interpersonal conflict; aggressive behavior; paranoia; and difficulties with work, education and accommodation. Significant reductions in substance dependence, depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial impairment, and improvements in quality of life, were identified in the sample. Risk factors were associated with less positive outcomes, specifically interpersonal conflict and poor mental health. Completion of specific components of the program were associated with more positive outcomes - a dose response was also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBT can be delivered in secure US correctional settings and may help to fill unmet needs for in-person treatment. Specifically, this digital CBT program may support incarcerated individuals to address methamphetamine use, with outcomes being associated with psychosocial risk factors and program engagement."

Evidence-based technology-enabled interventions can provide cost-effective, accessible, and resource-efficient solutions for addressing mental health issues. This study evaluated the first year of a supported digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) service provided by the national health service in Ireland, which has been accessible to individuals who receive a referral from one of five referring groups: General Practitioners, Primary Care Psychology, Counselling Primary Care, Community Mental Health, and Jigsaw (a nationwide youth mental health service). METHODS: A retrospective, observational study examining data from the service between April 2021 to April 2022 was conducted. Descriptive statistics on referrals, account activations, user demographics, program usage, and user satisfaction were extracted, and pre-to-post clinical outcomes for depression measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and for anxiety measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 were analysed using linear mixed effect models. RESULTS: There were 5,298 referrals and 3,236 (61%) account activations within the year. Most users were female (72.9%) and aged between 18 and 44 years (75.4%). The CBT programs were associated with significant reductions in both depression (β = 3.34, 95% CI [3.03, 3.65], p < 0.001) and anxiety (β = 3.64, 95% CI [3.36, 3.93], p < 0.001), with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8). Time spent using the programs was also found to be a predictor of the variability in these clinical outcomes (p < 0.001), and accounting for this resulted in significantly better model fits (p < 0.001). User satisfaction ratings were also very high, exceeding 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve the representation of male and older adult users are warranted. However, overall, the results demonstrate how digital CBT can be provided at scale and lead to symptom reductions with large effect sizes for patients seeking help for depression and anxiety. The findings substantiate the continued use and expansion of this service in Ireland and the more widespread implementation of similar services in other international public healthcare settings."
10.1016/j.ebr.2021.100469,Remote delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with functional neurological disorders: Promise and challenges,"Lin A, Espay AJ.",Epilepsy Behav Rep,2021,2021.8.19,,,"Functional neurological disorders (FND) are an important source of healthcare utilization and morbidity. While there are no formal guidelines for treating these disorders, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is emerging as a safe and effective treatment. Currently, there is a global shortage of CBT providers, with only a small subset trained in and comfortable with treating patients with FND. We highlight four types of remote CBT delivery to patients with FND to alleviate the access obstacle: workbooks, internet-guided CBT, app-based CBT, and teletherapy. CBT workbooks and teletherapy have been studied in FND, with preliminary studies suggesting efficacy; internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT have not but have been effectively used in patients with psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic disorders. As these disorders are often comorbid and share overlapping neurobiology with FND, internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT represent promising delivery options of CBT for FND. Although remotely-delivered CBT is unlikely to replace in-person CBT and there are technical and logistical challenges to overcome prior to widespread deployment, it holds promise as an adjunct treatment when in-person CBT is inaccessible. We propose a rational approach to future allocation of remote CBT treatment options and highlight important research gaps to bridge beforehand."
10.1186/s12913-025-12641-9,User journey method: a case study for improving digital intervention use measurement,"Lukka L, Vesterinen M, Salonen A, Bergman VR, Torkki P, Palva S, Palva JM.",BMC Health Serv Res,2025,2025.4.1,,,"BACKGROUND: Many digital mental health interventions meet low levels of use. However, current use measurement methods do not necessarily help identify which intervention elements are associated with dropout, despite this information potentially facilitating iterative intervention development. Here, we suggest improving the comprehensiveness of intervention use measurement with the user journey method, which evaluates every intervention element to identify intervention-specific use barriers. METHODS: We applied user journey method in a clinical trial that investigated the efficacy of a novel game-based intervention, Meliora, for adult Major Depressive Disorder. We modelled the intervention for its four technological (Recruitment, Website, Questionnaires, Intervention Software) and two interpersonal elements (Assessment, Support). We then applied the user journey method to measure how many users proceeded from one element to the next combining social media analytics, website use data, signup data, clinical subject coordinator interview data, symptom questionnaire data, and behavioral intervention use data. These measurements were complemented with the qualitative analysis of the study discovery sources and email support contacts. RESULTS: Recruitment: The intervention recruitment reached at least 145,000 Finns, with social media, word-of-mouth, and news and web sources being the most effective recruitment channels. Website: The study website received 16,243 visitors, which led to 1,007 sign-ups. ASSESSMENT: 895 participants were assessed and 735 were accepted. Intervention Software: 498 participants were assigned to the active intervention or comparator, of whom 457 used them at least once: on average, for 17.3 h (SD = 20.4 h) on 19.7 days (SD = 20.7 d) over a period of 38.9 days (SD = 31.2 d). The 28 intervention levels were associated with an average dropout rate of 2.6%, with two sections exhibiting an increase against this baseline. 150 participants met the minimum adherence goal of 24 h use. Questionnaires: 116 participants completed the post-intervention questionnaire. SUPPORT: 313 signed-up participants contacted the researchers via email. CONCLUSION: The user journey method allowed for the comprehensive evaluation of the six intervention elements, and enabled identifying use barriers expediting iterative intervention development and implementation.

10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041745,Efficacy of the iDBT-Pain skills training intervention to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in people with chronic pain: protocol for a single-case experimental design with multiple baselines,"Norman-Nott N, Wilks C, Hesam-Shariati N, Schroeder J, Suh J, Czerwinski M, Gustin SM.",BMJ Open,2021,2021.4.15,,,"INTRODUCTION: Difficulties in emotional regulation are key to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60-90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the University of New South Wales (HC200199). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

10.3390/ijerph16234689,Stepping Up: Predictors of 'Stepping' within an iCBT Stepped-Care Intervention for Depression,"Nicholas J, Ringland KE, Graham AK, Knapp AA, Lattie EG, Kwasny MJ, Mohr DC.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2019,2019.11.29,,,"Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) may overcome barriers to mental health care and has proven efficacious. However, this approach currently exists outside the existing mental health care delivery system. Stepped care is a proposed framework for integrating digital mental health (DMH) into health systems by initiating iCBT and ""stepping up"" care to a more intensive intervention should iCBT prove ineffective. This study explores pre-treatment factors associated with reaching stepping criteria among patients receiving iCBT. This exploratory analysis of a stepped care arm of a larger randomized trial examined participants who were stepped to a more intensive intervention if they did not respond to iCBT. The association of pre-treatment factors on stepping were examined using Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests. One-fifth of the 151 participants met criteria for stepping within the 20-week treatment period. Only pre-treatment depression severity and treatment preference were associated with increased likelihood of stepping (p = 0.049 and 0.048, respectively). The low number of individuals who stepped provides support for iCBT as an effective, low intensity treatment for depression. The modest association of pre-treatment depression and preference to not receive iCBT may be useful in identifying patients who are less likely to respond."
10.3390/ijerph20064777,Digital Addiction Intervention for Children and Adolescents: A Scoping Review,"Ding K, Li H.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2023,2023.3.29,,,"Digital devices play a significant role in the learning and living of children and adolescents, whose overuse or addiction has become a global concern. This scoping review seeks to synthesize existing studies to investigate relevant interventions and their effects on digital addiction in children (ages 0-18). To understand the latest advances, we have identified 17 studies published in international peer-reviewed journals between 2018-2022. The findings revealed that, first, most interventions for digital addiction in children and adolescents were cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) or CBT-based interventions, which could improve anxiety, depression, and related symptoms of digital addiction. Second, rather than directly targeting addictive behaviors, some family-based interventions aim to strengthen family functions and relationships. Finally, digital-based interventions, such as website-based, application-based, and virtual reality interventions, are promising in adolescent digital addiction interventions. However, these studies shared the same limitations: small sample sizes, short intervention durations, no control group, and nonrandomized assignments. The small sample size problem is difficult to solve by offline intervention. Meanwhile, online digital-based intervention is still in its infancy, resulting in limited generalizability of the findings and the inability to popularize digital intervention. Accordingly, future intervention studies should integrate various assessments and interventions to form an integrated platform to provide interventions for addicted children and adolescents worldwide."

Due to various barriers, such as limitations of healthcare offers, digital interventions, for example medical apps, can provide a suitable approach to support affected people. In the envisaged prospective randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the efficacy of the LightMood intervention. The LightMood intervention is a manualized and user-centered, digital intervention for patients with obesity, with a duration of 4 months, which contains elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based and skills-based exercises. We expect the LightMood intervention to be superior to treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of reducing depression symptoms. METHODS: The trial incorporates four distinct measurement time points: the baseline assessment, the post-treatment assessment, and 1- and 3-month follow-up assessments. Furthermore, we implemented in-treatment assessments for both groups. Participants will be randomized into two groups (LightMood intervention vs TAU). The aim is to include 128 participants (64 per group) in the study. Inclusion criteria are patients who are obese, at least 18 years old, with a private Internet access, and with adequate digital literacy and show depression symptoms (PHQ ≥ 10). Exclusion criteria are weekly outpatient individual psychotherapy, obesity surgery within the last year or planned within the next 7 months, no private Internet access, and the prescription of a new psychotropic drug within the last 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the post-assessment reduction in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include the improvement in self-efficacy, quality of life, mindfulness, reduction in eating disorder symptoms, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we expect a positive development of depression symptoms throughout the different time points (T1, T2, and T3) in patients with obesity. DISCUSSION: LightMood is an evidence-based, efficient, low-threshold online intervention that aims to reduce depression symptoms in people with obesity. Online interventions could offer a promising alternative to conventional face-to-face therapy. The primary objective of the current study is to add essential insight into the feasibility, efficacy, effectiveness, and acceptance of e-mental health interventions for people with obesity and depression symptoms.

In-person programs to promote activity in cardiac patients have been poorly attended, and increasingly patients are focused on mobile, self-management-based approaches to health. Accordingly, we completed a one-arm trial of a novel one-way 14-day text message intervention among 40 patients with a prior acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The two-pronged psychological-behavioral intervention alternated daily messages focused on promoting psychological well-being with messages providing specific education/advice regarding physical activity. All messages were successfully transmitted, and nearly all participants found the intervention to be helpful (n=37; 92.5%) and performed at least one specific health-related action in response to a text message (n=35; 87.5%). Post-intervention, participants had improvements in happiness (Cohen's d=0.25), determination (d=0.37), depression (d=-0.01), and anxiety (d=-0.13), though not optimism. Moreover, participants reported an increase in moderate physical activity of 105 minutes/week (baseline: 261 [SD 265] minutes/week, follow-up: 366 [SD 519]; d=0.25). These improvements were largely maintained two weeks later, with further increases in physical activity (414 [SD 570] minutes/week). Text messaging focused on well-being and physical activity was well-accepted and associated with improvements in activity and mental health in this high-risk clinical population."

We aimed to test a novel cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) app-based intervention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors. METHODS: Participants were recruited from neurology clinics in Iran and comprised individuals diagnosed with epilepsy and having moderate to severe insomnia. A two-arm randomized controlled trial design was used, consisting of a treatment group (CBT-I; n = 160) and control group (patient education; n = 160). Primary outcomes were self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep hygiene behavior and objective sleep characteristics measured by actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, action planning, coping planning, behavioral automaticity, self-monitoring, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postintervention, except objective sleep, which was assessed at baseline, and one and six months postintervention. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Current findings showed that sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency were significantly improved in the CBT-I group compared with the patient education group at all measurement points. Also, the CBT-I group had significantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared with the patient education group. Mediation analyses showed that attitude, intention, coping planning, self-monitoring, and behavioral automaticity significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. CONCLUSION: Results support the use of the CBT-I app to improve sleep outcomes among people with epilepsy."

Access to psychological treatment is scarce and, when available, often focuses on treating primary mental health problems rather than illness-related anxiety/depression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a newly developed, therapist-supported, digital cognitive-behavioural treatment (COMPASS) for reducing LTC-related psychological distress (anxiety/depression), compared with standard charity support (SCS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial (1:1 ratio) with nested qualitative study will be conducted. Two-hundred adults with LTC-related anxiety and depression will be recruited through national LTC charities. They will be randomly allocated to receive COMPASS or SCS only. An independent administrator will use Qualtrics randomiser for treatment allocation, to ensure allocation concealment. Participants will access treatment from home over 10 weeks. The COMPASS group will have access to the digital programme and six therapist contacts: one welcome message and five fortnightly phone calls. Data will be collected online at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-randomisation for primary outcome (Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, daily functioning, COVID-19-related distress, illness-related distress, quality of life, knowledge and confidence for illness self-management, symptom severity and improvement). Analyses will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle by a data analyst blinded to treatment allocation. A purposively sampled group of COMPASS participants and therapists will be interviewed. Interviews will be thematically analysed.

Utilization of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for treating depression and anxiety disorders in stepped-care models, such as the UK's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), is a potential solution for addressing the treatment gap in mental health. We investigated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT when fully integrated within IAPT stepped-care settings. We conducted an 8-week pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a 2:1 (iCBT intervention: waiting-list) allocation, for participants referred to an IAPT Step 2 service with depression and anxiety symptoms (Trial registration: ISRCTN91967124). The primary outcomes measures were PHQ-9 (depressive symptoms) and GAD-7 (anxiety symptoms) and WSAS (functional impairment) as a secondary outcome. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on EQ-5D-5L (preference-based health status) to elicit the quality-adjust life year (QALY) and a modified-Client Service Receipt Inventory (care resource-use). Diagnostic interviews were administered at baseline and 3 months. Three-hundred and sixty-one participants were randomized (iCBT, 241; waiting-list, 120). Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant interaction effects for the PHQ-9 (b = -2.75, 95% CI -4.00, -1.50) and GAD-7 (b = -2.79, 95% CI -4.00, -1.58) in favour of iCBT at 8-week and further improvements observed up to 12-months. Over 8-weeks the probability of cost-effectiveness was 46.6% if decision makers are willing to pay £30,000 per QALY, increasing to 91.2% when the control-arm's outcomes and costs were extrapolated over 12-months. Results indicate that iCBT for depression and anxiety is effective and potentially cost-effective in the long-term within IAPT. Upscaling the use of iCBT as part of stepped care could help to enhance IAPT outcomes. The pragmatic trial design supports the ecological validity of the findings."
10.1093/pm/pnx090,Quality and Usability of Arthritic Pain Self-Management Apps for Older Adults: A Systematic Review,"Bhattarai P, Newton-John TRO, Phillips JL.",Pain Med,2018,2017.5.26,,,"OBJECTIVE: To appraise the quality and usability of currently available pain applications that could be used by community-dwelling older adults to self-manage their arthritic pain. METHODS: A systematic review. Searches were conducted in App Store and Google Play to identify pain self-management apps relevant to arthritic pain management. English language pain management apps providing pain assessment and documentation function and pain management education were considered for inclusion. A quality evaluation audit tool based on the Stanford Arthritis Self-Management Program was developed a priori to evaluate app content quality. The usability of included apps was assessed using an established usability evaluation tool. RESULTS: Out of the 373 apps that were identified, four met the inclusion criteria. The included apps all included a pain assessment and documentation function and instructions on medication use, communication with health professionals, cognitive behavioral therapy-based pain management, and physical exercise. Management of mood, depression, anxiety, and sleep were featured in most apps (N = 3). Three-quarters (N = 3) of the apps fell below the acceptable moderate usability score (≥3), while one app obtained a moderate score (3.2). CONCLUSIONS: Few of the currently available pain apps offer a comprehensive pain self-management approach incorporating evidence-based strategies in accordance with the Stanford Arthritis Self-Management Program. The moderate-level usability across the included apps indicates a need to consider the usability needs of the older population in future pain self-management app development endeavors."

However, diversity exists in the CBT delivery formats, and the optimal delivery format remains unconfirmed. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of different delivery formats of CBT interventions on depression in patients with cancer. DESIGN: Network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCE: Six databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PsycINFO, were searched from inception to May 30, 2024. METHODS: Two reviewers independently conducted study inclusion, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. A pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis were performed sequentially to determine the efficacy of CBT delivery formats for improving depression in patients with cancer. RESULTS: A total of 34 randomized controlled trials involving six delivery formats of CBT were included. Face-to-face group CBT (SMD = -0.88, 95% CI [-1.33, -0.44]), internet-based individual CBT (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.06]), app-based individual CBT (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI [-1.45, -0.18]), and combined delivery formats of CBT for individual (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.09]) were significantly more effective than the inactive control. The ranking probabilities revealed that face-to-face group CBT (P-score = 0.86), app-based individual CBT (P-score = 0.74) and internet-based individual CBT (P-score = 0.57) were the three most effective delivery formats of CBT. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the efficacy ranking of different CBT delivery formats in improving depression in patients with cancer. These findings are expected to provide evidence-based support for future research and clinical decision making for improving depression in patients with cancer.

METHODS: We searched five electronic databases from inception to June 2024. Data were synthesized using the inverse-variance method, reporting standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,128 participants were included. Exergames significantly improved depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.11 to -0.40, p < .001). Meta-regression showed no influence of sample size, health status, intervention duration, gender, or gaming device. No significant effects were found for ADLs (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.75 to 0.76, p = .988) or fear of falling (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.40 to 0.08, p = .189). CONCLUSIONS: Exergames enhance mental health in older adults but lack clear effects on physical function or fear of falling. High-quality, long-term studies are needed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Exergames offer an engaging intervention to reduce depressive symptoms, complementing mental health therapies. Clinicians should use modern platforms and combine exergames with physical or behavioral interventions to address ADLs and fear of falling."
10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.06.020,Interventions for Adolescent Mental Health: An Overview of Systematic Reviews,"Das JK, Salam RA, Lassi ZS, Khan MN, Mahmood W, Patel V, Bhutta ZA.",J Adolesc Health,2016,2016.9.25,,,"Many mental health disorders emerge in late childhood and early adolescence and contribute to the burden of these disorders among young people and later in life. We systematically reviewed literature published up to December 2015 to identify systematic reviews on mental health interventions in adolescent population. A total of 38 systematic reviews were included. We classified the included reviews into the following categories for reporting the findings: school-based interventions (n = 12); community-based interventions (n = 6); digital platforms (n = 8); and individual-/family-based interventions (n = 12). Evidence from school-based interventions suggests that targeted group-based interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective in reducing depressive symptoms (standard mean difference [SMD]: -.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -.26 to -.05) and anxiety (SMD: -.33; 95% CI: -.59 to -.06). School-based suicide prevention programs suggest that classroom-based didactic and experiential programs increase short-term knowledge of suicide (SMD: 1.51; 95% CI: .57-2.45) and knowledge of suicide prevention (SMD: .72; 95% CI: .36-1.07) with no evidence of an effect on suicide-related attitudes or behaviors. Community-based creative activities have some positive effect on behavioral changes, self-confidence, self-esteem, levels of knowledge, and physical activity. Evidence from digital platforms supports Internet-based prevention and treatment programs for anxiety and depression; however, more extensive and rigorous research is warranted to further establish the conditions. Among individual- and family-based interventions, interventions focusing on eating attitudes and behaviors show no impact on body mass index (SMD: -.10; 95% CI: -.45 to .25); Eating Attitude Test (SMD: .01; 95% CI: -.13 to .15); and bulimia (SMD: -.03; 95% CI: -.16 to .10). Exercise is found to be effective in improving self-esteem (SMD: .49; 95% CI: .16-.81) and reducing depression score (SMD: -.66; 95% CI: -1.25 to -.08) with no impact on anxiety scores. Cognitive behavioral therapy compared to waitlist is effective in reducing remission (odds ratio: 7.85; 95% CI: 5.31-11.6). Psychological therapy when compared to antidepressants have comparable effect on remission, dropouts, and depression symptoms. The studies evaluating mental health interventions among adolescents were reported to be very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, interventions, and outcomes; hence, meta-analysis could not be conducted in most of the included reviews. Future trials should also focus on standardized interventions and outcomes for synthesizing the exiting body of knowledge. There is a need to report differential effects for gender, age groups, socioeconomic status, and geographic settings since the impact of mental health interventions might vary according to various contextual factors."

Digital therapies are a promising means of promoting access to care. Currently, among the digital treatments for depression in adolescents recognized by the NICE guidelines, there is SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor), based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT. This narrative review aimed to evaluate: 1) Who were the depressed young people who used SPARX and what was their experience with the treatment? 2) Were users satisfied with the SPARX treatment? Did the youth's perceived level of satisfaction with using SPARX impact completion rates? 3) What was the role of professionals (researchers, consultants, teachers) in the SPARX studies? Has their support in running SPARX affected completion rates? METHODS: A narrative review of the English literature was performed. The articles were searched in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases (from 2012 to 2023) with keywords such as 'SPARX,' depression' and 'young adult'. RESULTS: Of 557 papers, 18 were included in our review. The young people who used SPARX were students or adolescents from special help-seeker populations at risk or with mild to moderate depression. The highest satisfaction levels were present in users of primary health services, such as general practice and counseling services. The support of the school counselor and experts in mental health clinicians was instrumental in impacting user satisfaction and completion rates. The personalization of the game in terms of user culture - symbols, language, norms, values, and artifacts; the customization of the avatar, the gender identity; the narrative structure; the presence of a guide character (virtual therapist); the CBT homework seemed to represent crucial SPARX characteristics related to satisfaction and completion rates. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our narrative review provides an overview of the main results of using SPARX with interesting considerations that may suggest improvements for broader use and diffusion of this digital treatment."

Digital interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, and mindfulness programs, have shown promise when applied in workplace settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews in order to critically evaluate, synthesize, and summarize evidence of various digital mental health interventions available within a workplace setting. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify systematic reviews relating to digital interventions for the workplace, using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). The review protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. Data were extracted using a predefined extraction table. To assess the methodological quality of a study, the AMSTAR-2 tool was used to critically appraise systematic reviews of health care interventions. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 11,875 records, which was reduced to 14 full-text systematic literature reviews with the use of Covidence to remove duplicates and screen titles and abstracts. The 14 included reviews were published between 2014 and 2023, comprising 9 systematic reviews and 5 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. AMSTAR-2 was used to complete a quality assessment of the reviews, and the results were critically low for 7 literature reviews and low for the other 7 literature reviews. The most common types of digital intervention studied were cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness/meditation, and stress management followed by other self-help interventions. Effectiveness of digital interventions was found for many mental health symptoms and conditions in employee populations, such as stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, and psychological well-being. Factors such as type of technology, guidance, recruitment, tailoring, and demographics were found to impact effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review aimed to critically evaluate, synthesize, and summarize evidence of various digital mental health interventions available within a workplace setting. Despite the low quality of the reviews, best practice guidelines can be derived from factors that impact the effectiveness of digital interventions in the workplace.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the psychological intervention with the most empirical support for the clinical management of anxiety and depressive disorders. Anxiety and depression frequently occur in women during the perinatal period, and there is growing evidence that internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) could be an acceptable and effective intervention. THIS WAY UP, an Australian digital mental health service, has developed a program for postnatal anxiety and depression. This study protocol aims to examine the acceptability and efficacy of a French-Canadian adaptation of the program. METHODS/DESIGN: The research team propose to conduct a mixed hybrid type 1 pragmatic randomized clinical trial and implementation study to replicate the findings of the trial conducted in Australia by Loughnan et al. (2019), as well as explore barriers and facilitators to potential large-scale implementation. TREATMENT AND CONTROL CONDITIONS: a) postnatal anxiety and depression iCBT program with three lessons to complete in a six-week period, added to treatment-as-usual (TAU); b) TAU. Participants will include French-speaking women with probable postnatal depression or anxiety as per the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) or the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The primary outcome measures will be the GAD-7 and the EPDS. Secondary outcome measures will comprise self-reported instruments to evaluate psychological distress, quality of life, mother-child experience, and treatment experience. Qualitative interviews with participants and health professionals will provide insights on acceptability and delivery of the iCBT program. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis will follow intent-to-treat principles. A mixed model regression approach will be used to account for between- and within-subject variations in the analysis of the effects of iCBT compared to TAU only intervention. DISCUSSION: The study will generate important data of efficacy and acceptability to patients, clinicians, and decision-makers to inform the scaling-up of the postnatal iCBT intervention in Canada.

10.1371/journal.pone.0286792,Molehill Mountain feasibility study: Protocol for a non-randomised pilot trial of a novel app-based anxiety intervention for autistic people,"Oakley B, Boatman C, Doswell S, Dittner A, Clarke A, Ozsivadjian A, Kent R, Judd A, Baldoza S, Hearn A, Murphy D, Simonoff E; Molehill Mountain Advisory Group.",PLoS One,2023,2023.7.5,,,"Up to 50% of autistic people experience co-occurring anxiety, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Consequently, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety has been indicated as a priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic community. Despite this, there are very few effective, evidence-based therapies available to autistic people that target anxiety; and those that are available (e.g., autism adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CBT) can be challenging to access. Thus, the current study will provide an early-stage proof of concept for the feasibility and acceptability of a novel app-based therapeutic approach that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. This paper describes the design and methodology of an ethically approved (22/LO/0291) ongoing non-randomised pilot trial that aims to enrol approximately 100 participants aged ≥16-years with an existing autism diagnosis and mild-to-severe self-reported anxiety symptoms (trial registration NCT05302167). Participants will be invited to engage with a self-guided app-based intervention-'Molehill Mountain'. Primary (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (medication/ service use and Goal Attainment Scaling) will be assessed at baseline (Week 2 +/- 2), endpoint (Week 15 +/- 2) and three follow-ups (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4). Participants will also be invited to complete an app acceptability survey/ interview at the study endpoint. Analyses will address: 1) app acceptability/ useability and feasibility (via survey/ interview and app usage data); and 2) target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention (via primary/ secondary outcome measures and survey/ interview)-with both objectives further informed by a dedicated stakeholder advisory group. The evidence from this study will inform the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a randomised-controlled trial, to provide a novel tool that can be accessed easily by autistic adults and may improve mental health outcomes."
10.1192/bjo.2022.546,Practitioners' experience of the working alliance in a blended cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention for depression: qualitative study of barriers and facilitators,"Doukani A, Free C, Araya R, Michelson D, Cerga-Pashoja A, Kakuma R.",BJPsych Open,2022,2022.7.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital technologies have been widely acknowledged as a potentially useful resource for increasing mental healthcare access. The working alliance is a key influence on outcomes in conventional psychotherapy, but little is known about therapists' experiences of forming an effective working alliance in blended interventions that involve in-person psychotherapy and a digital programme. AIMS: To investigate psychological well-being practitioners' (PWPs') experiences of the working alliance in a trial of blended cognitive-behavioural therapy (b-CBT) for depression. Trial registration ISRCTN12388725. METHOD: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 PWPs who delivered b-CBT in a two-arm, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of b-CBT compared with face-to-face CBT. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Participants reported four facilitating factors when building and maintaining a working alliance in b-CBT: having more time to deliver treatment, access to a wider toolkit, capacity to tailor components of b-CBT and receiving appropriate training and support. Participants also identified four barriers to building and maintaining a working alliance: time and resource constraints, usability challenges, limited flexibility to tailor the digital programme to patients' needs and lack of confidence in delivering b-CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first specifically to investigate practitioners' perceived facilitators and barriers to forming a working alliance in b-CBT for depression. Findings suggest that PWPs' experiences of the working alliance can be improved by: accounting for the time required to deliver b-CBT in service workflows to reduce time pressures; increasing opportunities to tailor the digital programme through offering transdiagnostic tools and adaptable features; and providing appropriate b-CBT training and technical support."
10.2196/57368,Psychological eHealth Interventions for Patients With Cardiovascular Diseases: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Su JJ, Lin R, Batalik L, Wong AKC, Grace SL.",J Med Internet Res,2025,2025.4.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. While eHealth is increasingly used to deliver psychological interventions, their effectiveness for patients with CVDs remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of eHealth psychological interventions for patients with CVDs. METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved from 5 databases (Embase, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library), covering the period from database inception to December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of evidence-based psychological eHealth interventions to improve psychosocial well-being and cardiovascular outcomes for people with CVDs were included. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (version 2) was used to judge the methodological quality of reviewed studies. RevMan (version 5.3) was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs, comprising 2319 participants from 10 countries, were included in the review. The results demonstrated significant alleviation of depressive symptoms for patients receiving psychological eHealth intervention compared to controls (number of paper included in that particular analysis, n=7; standardized mean difference=-0.30, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.14; I2=57%; P<.001). More specifically, in 6 trials where internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy was delivered, a significant alleviation of depressive symptoms was achieved (standardized mean difference=-0.39, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.21; I2=53%; P<.001). There was no significant change in anxiety or quality of life. Synthesis without meta-analysis regarding stress, adverse events, and cardiovascular events showed inconclusive findings. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological eHealth interventions, particularly internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, can significantly reduce depressive symptoms among patients with CVDs. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for comprehensively improving psychological and cardiovascular outcomes. Future studies should explore integrating persuasive design features into eHealth and involving mental health professionals for intervention delivery.

Innovative prevention strategies targeting both conditions are needed to reduce their health burden and costs. ICare Prevent is such an innovative strategy and contains a transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based and mobile-supported intervention. It addresses common risk factors of depression and anxiety as part of a large EU-funded multi-country project* (ICare). Little is known about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention compared to care as usual (CAU) for college students. We hypothesize that ICare Prevent will be more (cost-)effective than CAU in the reduction of symptoms of depression and anxiety. METHODS: A three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled superiority trial will be conducted comparing a guided and an unguided version of ICare Prevent with a control group receiving CAU. The trial will be open-label but outcome assessors will be blinded. A total of 252 college students (age ≥ 16 years) with subclinical symptoms of depression defined as a score ≥ 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and/or anxiety, defined as a score ≥ 5 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), will be included. Those meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder will be excluded. The primary outcome is change in disorder specific symptom severity from baseline to post-intervention. Secondary endpoints include self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms as well as time to onset of a mood or anxiety disorder until 12-month follow-up. Societal costs and quality of life will be assessed to estimate the intervention's cost-effectiveness compared to CAU. DISCUSSION: Transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based prevention could be a (cost-)effective approach to tackle the disease burden of depression and anxiety among college students.

10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad072,Identifying factors associated with user retention and outcomes of a digital intervention for substance use disorder: a retrospective analysis of real-world data,"Günther F, Wong D, Elison-Davies S, Yau C.",JAMIA Open,2023,2023.9.4,,,"OBJECTIVES: Successful delivery of digital health interventions is affected by multiple real-world factors. These factors may be identified in routinely collected, ecologically valid data from these interventions. We propose ideas for exploring these data, focusing on interventions targeting complex, comorbid conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively explores pre-post data collected between 2016 and 2019 from users of digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-containing psychoeducation and practical exercises-for substance use disorder (SUD) at UK addiction services. To identify factors associated with heterogenous user responses to the technology, we employed multivariable and multivariate regressions and random forest models of user-reported questionnaire data. RESULTS: The dataset contained information from 14 078 individuals of which 12 529 reported complete data at baseline and 2925 did so again after engagement with the CBT. Ninety-three percent screened positive for dependence on 1 of 43 substances at baseline, and 73% screened positive for anxiety or depression. Despite pre-post improvements independent of user sociodemographics, women reported more frequent and persistent symptoms of SUD, anxiety, and depression. Retention-minimum 2 use events recorded-was associated more with deployment environment than user characteristics. Prediction accuracy of post-engagement outcomes was acceptable (Area Under Curve [AUC]: 0.74-0.79), depending non-trivially on user characteristics. DISCUSSION: Traditionally, performance of digital health interventions is determined in controlled trials. Our analysis showcases multivariate models with which real-world data from these interventions can be explored and sources of user heterogeneity in retention and symptom reduction uncovered. CONCLUSION: Real-world data from digital health interventions contain information on natural user-technology interactions which could enrich results from controlled trials."

Digital trials have the potential to improve access to research and clinical treatments for the most vulnerable and minoritized, including pregnant and postpartum individuals. However, digital trials are underutilized in maternal and child health research, and there is limited evidence to inform the design and conduct of digital trials. Our research collaborative, consisting of 5 research teams in the U.S. and Australia, aimed to address this gap. We collaborated to share lessons learned from our experiences recruiting and retaining pregnant and postpartum individuals in digital trials of social and behavioral interventions. We first discuss the promise of digital trials in improving participation in research during the perinatal period, as well as the unique challenges they pose. Second, we present lessons learned from 12 completed and ongoing digital trials that have used platforms such as Ovia, Facebook, and Instagram for recruitment. Our trials evaluated interventions for breastfeeding, prenatal and postpartum depression, insomnia, decision making, and chronic pain. We focus on challenges and lessons learned in 3 key areas: (1) rapid recruitment of large samples with a diversity of minoritized identities, (2) retention of study participants in longitudinal studies, and (3) prevention of fraudulent enrollment. We offer concrete strategies that we pilot-tested to address these challenges. Strategies presented in this commentary can be incorporated, as well as formally evaluated, in future studies."
10.2196/10732,Efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Reducing Suicidal Ideation and Deliberate Self-Harm: Systematic Review,"Tighe J, Nicholas J, Shand F, Christensen H.",JMIR Ment Health,2018,2018.6.27,,,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in the 1980s, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has become a reputable evidence-based psychological therapy for certain disorders. Trials examining the efficacy of ACT are spread across a broad spectrum of presentations, such as chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, ACT has very rarely been trialed as an intervention for suicidal ideation (SI) or deliberate self-harm (DSH). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy of ACT in reducing SI and DSH and to examine the suitability of reported SI, DSH, and other measures in determining the efficacy of ACT. METHODS: We systematically reviewed studies on ACT as intervention for SI and self-harm. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched. The reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were examined to identify additional publications. Search terms were identified with reference to the terminology used in previous review papers on ACT and suicide prevention. The study design was not restricted to randomized controlled trials. Screening was completed by 2 reviewers, and all duplicates were removed. Publications were excluded if they were not published in English, were multicomponent therapy or were not based on ACT, or lacked a validated measure or structured reporting of SI/DSH outcomes. RESULTS: After removing the duplicates, 554 articles were screened for relevance. Following the screening, 5 studies that used ACT as an intervention for suicidal or self-harming individuals were identified. The studies used diverse methodologies and included 2 case studies, 2 pre-post studies, and 1 mHealth randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: The review found that ACT is effective in reducing SI in the 2 pre-post studies but not in other studies. However, given the small number and lack of methodological rigor of the studies included in this review, insufficient evidence exists for the recommendation of ACT as an intervention for SI or DSH."

Among different therapeutic approaches (eg, medication and psychotherapy), psychotherapy in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard treatment for MDD. However, although efficacious, CBT is not readily accessible to many patients in need because of hurdles such as stigma, long wait times, high cost, the large time commitment for health care providers, and cultural or geographic barriers. Electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT) can effectively address many of these accessibility barriers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of implementing an e-CBT program compared with in-person treatment for MDD. It is hypothesized that the e-CBT program will offer results comparable with those of the in-person treatment program, regarding symptom reduction and quality of life improvement. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will provide e-CBT for MDD through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants (aged 18-65 years) will be offered 12 weekly sessions of an e-CBT program tailored to MDD to address their depressive symptoms. Participants (n=55) will complete predesigned modules and homework assignments while receiving personalized feedback and interacting with a therapist through the platform. Using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, the efficacy of the e-CBT program will be compared with that of a group (n=55) receiving in-person CBT. Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at week 6 and week 12, and at a 6-month follow-up. Focus groups will be conducted to investigate personal, cultural, and social factors impacting the accessibility and feasibility of implementing a web-based psychotherapy tool from a patient and care provider perspective. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of MDD, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak and read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria include active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: Ethics approval was obtained in January 2019, and recruitment of participants began in June 2019. Recruitment has been conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 52 participants have been recruited to the e-CBT group, and 48 patients have been recruited to the in-person CBT group. Data collection is expected to be completed by March 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by June 2021, as linear regression (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes) are still being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can provide valuable information for the development of more accessible and scalable mental health interventions with increased care capacity for MDD, without sacrificing the quality of care.

10.1093/sleep/zsaa258,Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia promotes later health resilience during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic,"Cheng P, Casement MD, Kalmbach DA, Castelan AC, Drake CL.",Sleep,2021,2020.11.29,,,"Comment in Sleep. 2021 Apr 9;44(4):zsab036. doi: 10.1093/sleep/zsab036. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Stressful life events contribute to insomnia, psychosocial functioning, and illness. Though individuals with a history of insomnia may be especially vulnerable during stressful life events, risk may be mitigated by prior intervention. This study evaluated the effect of prior digital cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) versus sleep education on health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID impact, insomnia, general- and COVID-related stress, depression, and global health were assessed in April 2020 in adults with a history of insomnia who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I (n = 102) versus sleep education control (n = 106) in 2016-2017. Regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of intervention conditions on subsequent stress and health during the pandemic. RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with COVID-19 related disruptions, and those who previously received dCBT-I reported less insomnia symptoms, less general stress and COVID-related cognitive intrusions, less depression, and better global health than those who received sleep education. Moreover, the odds for resurgent insomnia was 51% lower in the dCBT-I versus control condition. Similarly, odds of moderate to severe depression during COVID-19 was 57% lower in the dCBT-I condition. CONCLUSIONS: Those who received dCBT-I had increased health resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with a history of insomnia and ongoing mild to moderate mental health symptoms. These data provide evidence that dCBT-I is a powerful tool to promote mental and physical health during stressors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02988375."

Yet, poor sleep has historically been neglected as a specific treatment target in mental health programmes (Freeman, Sheaves, Waite, Harvey, & Harrison, 2020). METHOD: All patients over a 12-month period entering the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service endorsing a 'poor sleep' questionnaire item at assessment, were offered a self-guided digital sleep intervention, Sleepio, in addition to routine care. Sleepio is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Propensity score matching established a non-Sleepio control group matched on demographic and baseline clinical measures. RESULTS: Patients who signed up to Sleepio (n = 510) achieved significantly better outcomes on core clinical metrics (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WSAS) than controls. IAPT recovery rates1 (on PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were 64.7%, versus 58% in the control group. Duration of clinical contact time was marginally elevated overall in the Sleepio group but by less than 1 h CONCLUSIONS: Significant clinical benefit was associated with the introduction of an evidence-based digital sleep intervention alongside other mental health interventions for depression and anxiety. Widespread deployment was achieved with immediate availability, minimal additional clinical time or staff training. This approach provides a feasible and highly scalable model for improving mental health outcomes in clinical services."

Despite significant barriers to seeking and receiving in-person mental health care, little research has focused on the efficacy of telepsychology among individuals with SCI. OBJECTIVES: To describe the design and implementation of an ongoing single-center, randomized controlled, video-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention among individuals with SCI. METHODS: Participants within 1 year of SCI will be randomized 1:1 to intervention or usual care in a 24-week study. Intervention participants will engage in 10 sessions of CBT over 12 weeks with a licensed clinical psychologist, using iPads via Apple FaceTime. Primary outcomes are depressive symptomatology, anxiety, and life satisfaction (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Satisfaction with Life Scale, respectively) measured at three time points (baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks). These and other measures are also assessed during monthly telephone surveys conducted between primary timepoints. RESULTS: Recruitment is ongoing. Forty-six participants have been enrolled thus far. CONCLUSION: Telepsychology is a convenient, flexible, and effective alternative to traditional in-person services. We anticipate that intervention participants will experience improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms and will have greater life satisfaction. Telepsychology interventions among individuals with SCI are tasked to maintain participant privacy, provide assistive technology and/or engage caregivers to minimize mobility limitations, and manage risk remotely. Challenges encountered include recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early intervention on symptoms of psychological morbidity using telepsychology may facilitate greater adaptation following SCI."

In this paper, we describe the development using a theory, evidence and person-based approach. DESIGN: Intervention development using a theory, evidence and person-based approach. SETTING: Primary Care in the South of England. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen participants with a range of antidepressant experience took part in 'think aloud' interviews for intervention optimisation. INTERVENTION: Our digital intervention prototype (called 'ADvisor') was developed on the basis of a planning phase consisting of qualitative and quantitative reviews, an in-depth qualitative study, the development of guiding principles and a theory-based behavioural analysis. Our optimisation phase consisted of 'think aloud' interviews where the intervention was iteratively refined. RESULTS: The qualitative systematic review and in-depth qualitative study highlighted the centrality of fear of depression relapse as a key barrier to discontinuation. The quantitative systematic review showed that psychologically informed approaches such as cognitive-behavioural therapy were associated with greater rates of discontinuation than simple advice to reduce. Following a behavioural diagnosis based on the behaviour change wheel, social cognitive theory provided a theoretical basis for the intervention. The intervention was optimised on the basis of think aloud interviews, where participants suggested they like the flexibility of the system and found it reassuring. Changes were made to the tone of the material and the structure was adjusted based on this qualitative feedback. CONCLUSIONS: 'ADvisor' is a theory, evidence and person-based digital intervention designed to support antidepressant discontinuation. The intervention was perceived as helpful and reassuring in optimisation interviews. Trials are now needed to determine the feasibility, clinical and cost-effectiveness of this approach."
10.2196/36978,Comparability of Patients in Trials of eHealth and Face-to-Face Psychotherapeutic Interventions for Depression: Meta-synthesis,"Aemissegger V, Lopez-Alcalde J, Witt CM, Barth J.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.9.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders (DDs) are a public health problem. Face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions are a first-line option for their treatment in adults. There is a growing interest in eHealth interventions to maximize accessibility for effective treatments. Thus, the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of eHealth psychotherapeutic interventions has increased, and these interventions are being offered to patients. However, it is unknown whether patients with DDs differ in internet-based and face-to-face intervention trials. This information is essential to gain knowledge about eHealth trials' external validity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the baseline characteristics of patients with DDs included in the RCTs of eHealth and face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions with a cognitive component. METHODS: In this meta-epidemiological study, we searched 5 databases between 1990 and November 2017 (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and the database of Cuijpers et al). We included RCTs of psychotherapeutic interventions with a cognitive component (eg, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], or interpersonal therapy) delivered face-to-face or via the internet to adults with DDs. Each included study had a matching study for predefined criteria to allow a valid comparison of characteristics and was classified as a face-to-face (CBT) or eHealth (internet CBT) intervention trial. Two authors selected the studies, extracted data, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We tested whether predefined baseline characteristics differed in face-to-face and internet-based trials using a mixed-effects model and testing for differences with z tests (statistical significance set at .05). For continuous outcomes, we also estimated the difference in means between subgroups with 95% CI. RESULTS: We included 58 RCTs (29 matching pairs) with 3846 participants (female: n=2803, 72.9%) and mean ages ranging from 20-74 years. White participants were the most frequent (from 63.6% to 100%). Other socioeconomic characteristics were poorly described. The participants presented DDs of different severity measured with heterogeneous instruments. Internet CBT trials had a longer depression duration at baseline (7.19 years higher, CI 95% 2.53-11.84; 10.0 vs 2.8 years; P=.002), but the proportion of patients with previous depression treatment was lower (24.8% vs 42%; P=.04). Subgroup analyses found no evidence of differences for the remaining baseline characteristics: age, gender, education, living area, depression severity, history of depression, actual antidepressant medication, actual physical comorbidity, actual mental comorbidity, study dropout, quality of life, having children, family status, and employment. We could not compare proficiency with computers due to the insufficient number of studies. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline characteristics of patients with DDs included in the RCTs of eHealth and face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions are generally similar. However, patients in eHealth trials had a longer duration of depression, and a lower proportion had received previous depression treatment, which might indicate that eHealth trials attract patients who postpone earlier treatment attempts.

Women face a heightened risk of depression during pregnancy and after childbirth, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and her family. It is essential to explore preventive strategies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of education focused on health-promoting behaviors in preventing postpartum depression (PPD) through social messaging among pregnant women. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial study involved 108 non-depressed eligible pregnant women with a gestational age of 28-30 weeks during 2022-2023. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups using a block randomization method. The intervention group received virtual education based on health-promoting behaviors weekly over six sessions. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP II) questionnaires were utilized to evaluate outcomes. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 23, with a significance level set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean differences between the scores of EPDS, PHQ-9 and HPLP II before and after the intervention in two groups were - 4.85 (CI95%= -3.22, -6.48), -6.22 (CI95%= -4.43, -8.00) and 28.22 (CI95%= 23.41, 33.03), respectively, which were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The findings regarding the dimensions of health-promoting behaviors also indicated that all dimensions increased significantly in the intervention group. The greatest and least amount of change was observed in the physical activity dimension at 5.50 (CI95%= 4.31, 6.68) and in interpersonal relations at 3.48 (CI95%= 2.24, 4.72), respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) for depression, based on the Edinburgh questionnaire six weeks postpartum was approximately 2.571, indicating that nearly one in two mothers who received education benefited. CONCLUSION: The app-based health-promoting behaviors intervention-benefiting from not requiring in-person referrals and providing a common platform for communication-is effective in enhancing health-promoting behaviors, reducing depression scores and decreasing the frequency of PPD. In other words, this type of intervention led to the prevention of postpartum depression and the promotion of health-promoting behaviors among pregnant women. REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered with the IRCT Registry on 31/05/2024 (registration number: IRCT20221109056451N2)."

However, despite the virtual ubiquity of technology in young people's lives, and good evidence that online treatments can be effective, there remain barriers to real-world implementation. We argue that remote therapist support and blended approaches to therapy will be important models in harnessing the potential of digital technology in CYP mental health."

This study assessed the feasibility of two-year follow-up of the Wellness Enhancement for Caregivers (WECARE) intervention for Chinese American dementia caregivers, examined the changes in psychosocial health and explored future strategies. METHOD: A mixed-method study was conducted two years after the initial WECARE intervention trial. Participants completed an online survey and phone interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed complementarily. RESULTS: Eighteen of 24 participants completed the survey and 15 participated in interviews. Caregivers reported deteriorating conditions of care-recipients and increased caregiving burden, but their depressive symptoms and life satisfaction remained lower compared to baseline. Participants highlighted sustained benefits of WECARE, including stress management, improved communication, and a sense of community through group chats. They expressed a need for ongoing social and information support. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term evaluation for digital interventions like WECARE and emphasizes the need for continuous support. Sustained benefits underscore the potential of culturally tailored digital health interventions for underserved dementia caregivers. Future efforts should integrate ongoing resource access to enhance caregivers' long-term well-being."
10.1016/j.cpr.2024.102520,Are digital psychological interventions for psychological distress and quality of life in cancer patients effective? A systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Zhang T, Ren Z, Wakefield CE, Hui BPH, Akechi T, Shi C, Du X, Chen W, Lai L, Zhao C, Li Y, Zhou Y.",Clin Psychol Rev,2025,2024.11.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Many cancer patients experience psychological distress and/or poor quality of life during or after their cancer treatment, yet they face multiple barriers to accessing psychological support. Digital psychological interventions represent a promising approach for addressing these barriers, however their comparative effectiveness remains uncertain. METHODS: Nine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to July 2024. The primary outcomes were psychological distress and quality of life, and the secondary outcomes were measures of depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, and fear of cancer recurrence in this study. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six RCTs with 23,154 participants were identified. Of these interventions, three types-digitally-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), health education, and virtual reality therapy (VRT)-demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared to non-active controls. Digital CBT, narrative interventions, and VRT significantly improved quality of life compared to non-active controls. For depression, both digital CBT and VRT were superior to the non-active control group. Regarding anxiety, CBT, psychoeducation, and VRT outperformed the non-active control group. In terms of fatigue, CBT, psychoeducation, VRT, and multi-component interventions all showed enhanced efficacy compared to the non-active control group. However, only CBT exhibited significantly superior effectiveness in alleviating insomnia compared to non-active controls. Similarly, only mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduced fear of cancer recurrence compared to the non-active control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that digital CBT and VRT are highly promising options for reducing psychological distress and enhancing the quality of life among cancer patients; further high-quality randomized controlled trials involving diverse populations are essential to validate these findings."

However, there is a lack of evidence-based interventions that are tailored to the population, and psychological support needs are commonly unmet. An internet-administered low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (LICBT)-based intervention (EJDeR [internetbaserad självhjälp för föräldrar till barn som avslutat en behandling mot cancer]) may provide a solution. OBJECTIVE: The first objective is to provide an overview of a multimethod approach that was used to inform the development of the EJDeR intervention. The second objective is to provide a detailed description of the EJDeR intervention in accordance with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist. METHODS: EJDeR was developed through a multimethod approach, which included the use of existing evidence, the conceptualization of distress, participatory action research, a cross-sectional survey, and professional and public involvement. Depending on the main presenting difficulty identified during assessment, LICBT behavioral activation or worry management treatment protocols are adopted for the treatment of depression or generalized anxiety disorder when experienced individually or when comorbid. EJDeR is delivered via the Uppsala University Psychosocial Care Programme (U-CARE) portal, a web-based platform that is designed to deliver internet-administered LICBT interventions and includes secure videoconferencing. To guide parents in the use of EJDeR, weekly written messages via the portal are provided by e-therapists comprising final year psychology program students with training in cognitive behavioral therapy. RESULTS: An overview of the development process and a description of EJDeR, which was informed by the TIDieR checklist, are presented. Adaptations that were made in response to public involvement are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: EJDeR represents a novel, guided, internet-administered LICBT intervention for supporting parents of children treated for cancer. Adopting the TIDieR checklist offers the potential to enhance fidelity to the intervention protocol and facilitate later implementation. The intervention is currently being tested in a feasibility study (the ENGAGE study). INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023708."
10.7717/peerj.16137,The efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Lin W, Li N, Yang L, Zhang Y.",PeerJ,2023,2023.11.6,,,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia and depression often co-occur. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) seems to be effective and safe for mitigating insomnia and depression. However, the efficacy of digitally-delivered CBT-I (dCBT-I) remains unclear. Therefore, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to systematically review and evaluate the efficacy of dCBT-I in adults with insomnia and depression. METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases (as of June 5, 2022) was conducted for RCTs on dCBT-I. Statistical analyses were performed using Revan Manager. The effects of dCBT-I on insomnia and depression were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Seven studies involving 3,597 participants were included. This meta-analysis showed that dCBT-I reduced the severity of insomnia (SMD = -0.85, 95% CI [-1.00 to -0.69], p < 0.001) and depression (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI [-0.55 to -0.38], p < 0.001) in short terms, and also mitigated the severity of insomnia (SMD = -0.71, 95% CI [-1.00 to -0.44], p < 0.001) and depression (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI [-0.68 to -0.15], p = 0.002) in long terms. The effect of dCBT-I was comparable to that of traditional face-to-face CBT-I, and was generally maintained at follow-ups of 6 weeks to 6 months. CONCLUSION: dCBT-I seems to be effective in alleviating insomnia and depression and might be considered as a viable treatment option for depression."

The UK's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme is part of the National Health Service (NHS) designed to provide a stepped care approach to treating people with anxiety and depressive disorders. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is widely used, with computerised and internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT and iCBT, respectively) being a suitable IAPT approved treatment alternative for step 2, low- intensity treatment. iCBT has accumulated a large empirical base for treating depression and anxiety disorders. However, the cost-effectiveness and impact of these interventions in the longer-term is not routinely assessed by IAPT services. The current study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders in IAPT. METHODS: The study is a parallel-groups, randomised controlled trial examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCBT interventions for depression and anxiety disorders, against a waitlist control group. The iCBT treatments are of 8 weeks duration and will be supported by regular post-session feedback by Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, during, and at the end of the 8-week treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-up. A diagnostic interview will be employed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Participants in the waitlist control group will complete measures at baseline and week 8, at which point they will receive access to the treatment. All adult users of the Berkshire NHS Trust IAPT Talking Therapies Step 2 services will be approached to participate and measured against set eligibility criteria. Primary outcome measures will assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. Secondary outcome measures will allow for the evaluation of long-term outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Analysis will be conducted on a per protocol and intention-to-treat basis. DISCUSSION: This study seeks to evaluate the immediate and longer-term impact, as well as the cost effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions for depression and anxiety. This study will contribute to the already established literature on internet-delivered interventions worldwide. The study has the potential to show how iCBT can enhance service provision, and the findings will likely be generalisable to other health services.

Digital self-management approaches could improve this disparity, potentially bolstering outreach and providing easy, relatively low-cost access to pain self-management interventions. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the short-term efficacy of EPIO (ie, inspired by the Greek goddess for the soothing of pain, Epione), a digital self-management intervention, for people living with chronic pain. METHODS: Patients (N=266) were randomly assigned to either the EPIO intervention (n=132) or a care-as-usual control group (n=134). Outcome measures included pain interference (Brief Pain Inventory; primary outcome measure), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-regulatory fatigue (Self-Regulatory Fatigue 18 scale), health-related quality of life (SF-36 Short Form Health Survey), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and pain acceptance (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire). Linear regression models used change scores as the dependent variables. RESULTS: The participants were primarily female (210/259, 81.1%), with a median age of 49 (range 22-78) years and a variety of pain conditions. Analyses (n=229) after 3 months revealed no statistically significant changes for the primary outcome of pain interference (P=.84), but significant reductions in the secondary outcomes of depression (mean difference -0.90; P=.03) and self-regulatory fatigue (mean difference -2.76; P=.008) in favor of the intervention group. No other statistically significant changes were observed at 3 months (all P>.05). Participants described EPIO as useful (ie, totally agree or agree; 95/109, 87.2%) and easy to use (101/109, 92.7%), with easily understandable exercises (106/109, 97.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-informed, user-centered digital pain self-management interventions such as EPIO may have the potential to effectively support self-management and improve psychological functioning in the form of reduced symptoms of depression and improved capacity to regulate thoughts, feelings, and behavior for people living with chronic pain.

Facebook is frequently used by Australian mothers, and offers flexibility, high levels of engagement and the ability to disseminate information and advice via social contacts. The Mums Step it Up Program is a newly developed 50 day team-based physical activity intervention delivered via a Facebook app. The program involves post-partum women working in teams of 4-8 friends aiming to achieve 10,000 steps per day measured by a pedometer. Women are encouraged to use the app to log their daily steps and undertake social and supportive interactions with their friends and other participants. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Mums Step it Up Program. METHOD/DESIGN: A sample of 126 women up to 12 months post-partum will be recruited through community-based health and family services. Participants will be randomly allocated into one of three groups: control, pedometer only and the Mums Step it Up Program. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome (objective physical activity) and the secondary outcomes (sleep quality and quantity, depressive symptoms, weight and quality of life) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the Mums Step it Up Program compared with the control and pedometer only groups. Analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat-basis using random effects mixed modeling. The effect of theorized mediators (physical activity attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control) will also be examined. DISCUSSION: This study will provide information about the potential of a Facebook app for the delivery of health behavior interventions. If this intervention proves to be effective it will be released on a mass scale and promoted to the general public.

10.1093/braincomms/fcad210,The role of brain white matter in depression resilience and response to sleep interventions,"Bresser T, Leerssen J, Hölsken S, Groote I, Foster-Dingley JC, van den Heuvel MP, Van Someren EJW.",Brain Commun,2023,2023.8.9,,,"Erratum in Brain Commun. 2025 Feb 28;7(1):fcaf064. doi: 10.1093/braincomms/fcaf064. Insomnia poses a high risk for depression. Brain mechanisms of sleep and mood improvement following cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia remain elusive. This longitudinal study evaluated whether (i) individual differences in baseline brain white matter microstructure predict improvements and (ii) intervention affects brain white matter microstructure. People meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 criteria for Insomnia Disorder (n = 117) participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing 6 weeks of no treatment with therapist-guided digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, circadian rhythm support or their combination (cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia + circadian rhythm support). Insomnia Severity Index and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report were assessed at baseline and followed up at Weeks 7, 26, 39 and 52. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired at baseline and Week 7. Skeletonized white matter tracts, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were quantified both tract-wise and voxel-wise using tract-based spatial statistics. Analyses used linear and mixed effect models while correcting for multiple testing using false discovery rate and Bonferroni for correlated endpoint measures. Our results show the following: (i) tract-wise lower fractional anisotropy in the left retrolenticular part of the internal capsule at baseline predicted both worse progression of depressive symptoms in untreated participants and more improvement in treated participants (fractional anisotropy × any intervention, PFDR = 0.053, Pcorr = 0.045). (ii) Only the cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia + circadian rhythm support intervention induced a trend-level mean diffusivity decrease in the right superior corona radiata (PFDR = 0.128, Pcorr = 0.108), and individuals with a stronger mean diffusivity decrease showed a stronger alleviation of insomnia (R = 0.20, P = 0.035). In summary, individual differences in risk and treatment-supported resilience of depression involve white matter microstructure. Future studies could target the role of the left retrolenticular part of the internal capsule and right superior corona radiata and the brain areas they connect."
10.1038/s41746-023-00800-3,Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia on depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Lee S, Oh JW, Park KM, Lee S, Lee E.",NPJ Digit Med,2023,2023.3.25,,,"Despite research into the development of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I), research into the outcomes of dCBT-I on insomnia and the associated clinical conditions of depression and anxiety have been limited. The PubMed, PsycINFO (Ovid), Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on adult patients with insomnia also having reported measures of depressive or anxiety symptoms. In total, 2504 articles were identified after duplicate removal, and 22 RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. At the post-treatment assessment, the dCBT-I group had a small to moderate effect in alleviating depressive (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.28; p < 0.001; k = 21) and anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI: -0.40, -0.19; p < 0.001; k = 18), but had a large effect on sleep outcome measures (SMD = -0.76; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.57; p < 0.001; k = 22). When considering treatment adherence, the treatment effects of those in the high adherent groups identified a more robust outcome, showing greater effect sizes than those in the low adherent groups for depression, anxiety, and sleep outcomes. Furthermore, additional subgroup analysis on studies that have used the fully automated dCBT-I treatment without the support of human therapists reported significant treatment effects for depression, anxiety, and sleep outcomes. The results demonstrated that digital intervention for insomnia yielded significant effects on alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as insomnia symptoms. Specifically, the study demonstrated significant effects on the above symptoms when considering treatment adherence and implementing fully automated dCBT-I."

Cognitive-behavioral coaching is rooted in evidence-based principles and has the potential to address some of these unmet care needs. Harnessing technology to facilitate broader dissemination within a blended care model shows additional promise for overcoming barriers to care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of a blended care coaching (BCC) program for clients presenting with moderate levels of anxiety and depression in real-world settings. METHODS: This study examined retrospective data from US-based individuals (N=1496) who presented with moderate levels of depression and anxiety symptoms and who received blended care coaching services. Using a short-term framework, clients met with coaches via a secure video conference platform and also received digital video lessons and exercises. To evaluate the effectiveness of the BCC program, mixed effects modeling was used to examine growth trajectories of anxiety and depression scores over the course of care. RESULTS: Out of the total sample of 1496 clients, 75.9% (n=1136) demonstrated reliable improvement, and 88.6% (n=1326) recovered based on either the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (anxiety) or Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression). On average, clients exhibited a significant decline in anxiety and depression symptoms during the initial weeks of coaching, with a continued decline over subsequent weeks at a lower rate. Engaging in a coaching session was associated with lower anxiety (b=-1.04) and depression (b=-0.79) symptoms in the same week, as well as lower anxiety (b=-0.74) and depression (b=-0.91) symptoms the following week (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The BCC program demonstrated strong outcomes in decreasing symptomology for clients presenting with moderate levels of anxiety and depression. When clients received coaching sessions, significant decreases in symptoms were observed, reflecting the importance of session attendance. Additionally, the steepest declines in symptoms tended to occur during the initial weeks of coaching, emphasizing the importance of client buy-in and early engagement. Collectively, these findings have implications for addressing unmet mental health care needs in a more accessible, cost-effective manner."

Traditional exposure-based treatment is hampered by the limited availability of airplane practice situations, which is a result of economical and practical concerns. Easily accessible and low-cost virtual reality exposure therapy may address these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of ZeroPhobia: Aviophobia (a self-help mobile app-based treatment) in reducing flight anxiety symptoms and depressive and anxiety symptoms. We will also investigate the effects of usage intensity, the sense of immersion, inherent absorption ability, and perceived user-friendliness on the treatment effect. METHODS: Participants (N=114) who are aged 18-64 years and experience at least mild symptoms of aviophobia will be recruited from the general Dutch population and randomized into a treatment group or waitlist control group. By using their own phones and rudimentary mobile virtual reality headsets, participants will receive six modules of psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy, which will include six levels of virtual reality exposure therapy over a period of 6 weeks. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, posttest (ie, after 6 weeks), and 3- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure of our study is the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures include anxiety and depression measures and additional covariates (including usage intensity, the degree of immersion, etc). We will test treatment effectiveness by conducting an intention-to-treat analysis and estimating average treatment effects on the treated. The mechanisms of treatment effect will also be explored.

10.3389/fgwh.2025.1497740,Proactive approaches to preventing postpartum depression in non-depressive pregnant women: a comprehensive scoping review,"Nguyen NT, Pengpid S.",Front Glob Womens Health,2025,2025.4.24,,,"INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression is a significant global health challenge that affects mothers, infants, and families. Although various preventive strategies show promise, comprehensive reviews evaluating interventions among pregnant women without a clinical diagnosis of depression remain limited. This scoping review aims to identify and synthesize the existing evidence on proactive postpartum depression prevention programs initiated during pregnancy. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews, we systematically searched PubMed and Scopus, supplemented by manual reference reviews. Our search strategy combined terms related to postpartum depression, pregnancy, and preventive interventions. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions conducted during pregnancy, targeting women without a clinical diagnosis of depression, and assessed PPD outcomes using established diagnostic criteria or validated screening tools. Only English-language articles published between 2013 and 2023 were considered. RESULTS: A total of 49 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were categorized into nine themes: psychoeducation (n = 18), home visits (n = 6), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (n = 6), mindfulness (n = 6), exercise (n = 4), dietary supplements (n = 3), interpersonal therapy (IPT) (n = 4), consultation (n = 1), and inhalation aromatherapy (n = 1). Psychoeducational and mindfulness-based interventions consistently reduce PPD risk, particularly when delivered in structured, theory-driven formats and incorporating family support. Digital CBT interventions demonstrated limited effectiveness due to lower engagement, while home-visit and consultation-based interventions were effective when integrated into existing maternal healthcare despite scalability challenges. Exercise and dietary supplement interventions yielded inconsistent outcomes, indicating that factors such as adherence, duration, and intensity are crucial determinants of effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Various proactive interventions are available to prevent PPD, and this scoping review systematically maps the different strategies used and their outcomes. Proactive, theory-based, and multi-component interventions, particularly psychoeducational and mindfulness programs, demonstrate promising potential. Future research should emphasize evaluating long-term outcomes, optimizing digital engagement strategies, and developing culturally tailored models to enhance scalability and accessibility across diverse populations, including low-resource settings."

OBJECTIVE: The current analysis focuses on changes in symptoms of depression in a guided sample of patients with depression who registered for an internet-based intervention, the iFightDepression tool, as well as the extent of intervention use, compared to an unguided sample. The objective is to further understand the effects of guidance and adherence on the intervention's potential to induce symptom change. METHODS: Log data from two convenience samples in German routine care were used to assess symptom change after 6-9 weeks of intervention as well as minimal dose (finishing at least two workshops). A linear regression model with changes in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score as a dependent variable and guidance and minimal dose as well as their interaction as independent variables was specified. RESULTS: Data from 1423 people with symptoms of depression (n=940 unguided, 66.1%) were included in the current analysis. In the linear regression model predicting symptom change, a significant interaction of guidance and minimal dose revealed a specifically greater improvement for patients who received guidance and also worked with the intervention content (β=-1.75, t=-2.37, P=.02), while there was little difference in symptom change due to guidance in the group that did not use the intervention. In this model, the main effect of guidance was only marginally significant (β=-.53, t=-1.78, P=.08). CONCLUSIONS: Guidance in internet-based interventions for depression is not only an important factor to facilitate adherence, but also seems to further improve results for patients adhering to the intervention compared to those who do the same but without guidance."

OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop the Interactive Maternal Group for Information and Emotional Support (IMAGINE) intervention, a facilitated social media group CBT intervention to prevent perinatal depression in youth in the United States, by adapting the Mothers and Babies (MB) course, an evidence-based in-person group CBT intervention. In this study, we report perspectives of youth and health care providers on perinatal youths' mental health needs and document how they informed IMAGINE design.

All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and inductive approaches to characterize perceptions of challenges and facilitators of youth perinatal mental health. Using a human-centered design approach, stakeholder perspectives were incorporated into the IMAGINE design. We classified MB adaptations to develop IMAGINE according to the Framework for Modification and Adaptation, reporting the nature, timing, reason, and goal of the adaptations. RESULTS: Youth and health care workers described stigma associated with young pregnancy and parenting, social isolation, and lack of material resources as significant challenges to youth mental wellness. They identified nonjudgmental support, peer companionship, and access to step-by-step guidance as facilitators of youth mental wellness. They endorsed the use of a social media group to prevent perinatal depression and recommended that IMAGINE facilitate peer support, deliver content asynchronously to accommodate varied schedules, use a confidential platform, and facilitate the discussion of topics beyond the MB curriculum, such as navigating support resources or asking medical questions. IMAGINE was adapted from MB to accommodate stakeholder recommendations and facilitate the transition to web-based delivery. Content was tailored to be multimodal (text, images, and video), and the language was shortened and simplified. All content was designed for asynchronous engagement, and redundancy was added to accommodate intermittent access. The structure was loosened to allow the intervention facilitator to respond in real time to topics of interest for youth. A social media platform was selected that allows multiple conversation channels and conceals group member identity. All adaptations sought to preserve the fidelity of the MB core components. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the effect of stigmatization of young pregnancy and social determinants of health on youth perinatal mental health. Stakeholders supported the use of a social media group to create a supportive community and improve access to evidence-based depression prevention. This study demonstrates how a validated intervention can be tailored to this unique group."

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, ""Depression in College Students,"" as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). RESULTS: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT."

Shifting the focus from depression treatment to preventing depression might be a viable way to reduce the disease burden. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention to reduce the incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) in patients with persistent back pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prevention of Depression in Back Pain Patients (PROD-BP) was a pragmatic, observer-blinded randomized clinical trial with a parallel design conducted in Germany. Eligible adults with a diagnosis of persistent back pain and subclinical depressive symptoms, but who were depression free, were recruited either on-site or after discharge from 82 orthopedic clinics between October 1, 2015, and July 31, 2017. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle from October 31, 2018, to April 30, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received an e-coach-guided, web-based self-help intervention that was based on cognitive behavioral therapy and tailored to the needs of patients with persistent back pain. The intervention included 6 obligatory modules and 3 optional modules to be completed by participants as well as feedback from e-coaches. Both the intervention and control groups had unrestricted access to treatment as usual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was time to onset of an MDE over a 12-month period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Secondary outcomes included depression severity, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related disability, pain self-efficacy, work capacity, and user satisfaction assessed with a variety of instruments. RESULTS: A total of 295 participants (mean [SD] age, 52.8 [7.7] years; 184 women [62.4%]) were recruited and randomized to either the intervention group (n = 149) or control group (n = 146). The intervention reduced the risk of MDE onset by 52% (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81; P < .001). Twenty-one participants (14.1%) in the intervention group and 41 participants (28.1%) in the control group experienced an MDE over the 12-month period. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 new case of MDE was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.79-9.44). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this trial showed that among patients with persistent back pain, depression can be prevented by a guided web-based self-help intervention in addition to treatment as usual. This finding suggests that using a scalable digital approach to integrate psychological treatment into routine pain management is feasible.

There is now strong evidence that a range of behavioral interventions are efficacious in reducing sexual risk behavior in these populations. Although a handful of these programs are just beginning to be disseminated widely, we still have not implemented effective programs to a level that would reduce the population incidence of HIV for minorities. We proposed that innovative approaches involving computational technologies be explored for their use in both developing new interventions and in supporting wide-scale implementation of effective behavioral interventions. Mobile technologies have a place in both of these activities. First, mobile technologies can be used in sensing contexts and interacting to the unique preferences and needs of individuals at times where intervention to reduce risk would be most impactful. Second, mobile technologies can be used to improve the delivery of interventions by facilitators and their agencies. Systems science methods including social network analysis, agent-based models, computational linguistics, intelligent data analysis, and systems and software engineering all have strategic roles that can bring about advances in HIV prevention in minority communities. Using an existing mobile technology for depression and 3 effective HIV prevention programs, we illustrated how 8 areas in the intervention/implementation process can use innovative computational approaches to advance intervention adoption, fidelity, and sustainability."
10.2196/48437,Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial in Hong Kong,Pan JY.,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023.9.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most common mental disorders worldwide. In Hong Kong, the prevalence of SAD is high, but its treatment rate is low. SAD has immense impact on academic or work performance, social life, career development, and quality of life. One of the most effective treatments for SAD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with internet-based CBT (iCBT) and virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) showing promise in treating SAD. However, internet interventions are underdeveloped in Chinese communities including Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an iCBT program that includes VRET, called ""Ease Anxiety in Social Event Online"" (Ease Online), for Hong Kong adults with SAD in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The 14-week Ease Online program is a guided self-help iCBT program with a blended mode of service delivery. The program comprises 9 web-based modules and 5 individual counseling sessions (including 2 VRET sessions) conducted remotely or face-to-face with a therapist to provide therapist support, as guided iCBT shows superior effects than unguided iCBT. Other program components include therapist feedback on assignments, internal messages, forums, client portfolios, web-based questionnaires, reminders, and web-based bookings. The program can be accessed either through a mobile app or program website through a PC with an internet connection. The participants are openly recruited and screened using a questionnaire and through an intake interview. Eligible participants are randomized by placing them into a web-based iCBT group, app-based iCBT group, or a waitlist control (WLC) group. Participants in the WLC group are assigned to the app-based program upon completion of the service of the 2 experimental groups. Measurements of social anxiety, depression and anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, automatic thoughts, and quality of life are administered at pretest, posttest, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Multivariate ANOVA with repeated measures will be performed to determine the intervention effectiveness on the continuous variables over time. RESULTS: Participant recruitment commenced in January 2021. As of February 2023, a total of 1811 individuals applied for the Ease Online program. In total, 401 intake interviews have been completed, and 329 eligible participants have joined the program, among whom 166 have completed the service. Data collection is still ongoing, which is expected to be completed in March 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind in combining iCBT and VRET for the treatment of SAD in Hong Kong. At a theoretical level, this study contributes to the development and evaluation of internet-based psychological interventions in Hong Kong. At a practical level, the Ease Online program may serve as an alternative service option for SAD clients in Hong Kong if proven effective.

10.2196/47636,Reduction of Sleep Medications via a Combined Digital Insomnia and Pharmacist-Led Deprescribing Intervention: Protocol for a Feasibility Trial,"Bramoweth AD, Hough CE, McQuillan AD, Spitznogle BL, Thorpe CT, Lickel JJ, Boudreaux-Kelly M, Hamm ME, Germain A.",JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023.7.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is one of the most common health problems among veterans and negatively impacts their health, function, and quality of life. Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line recommended treatment, sedative-hypnotic medications remain the most common. Sedative-hypnotics, however, have mixed effectiveness, are frequently prescribed longer than recommended, and are associated with numerous risks and adverse effects that negatively impact veteran function. Meeting the treatment needs of veterans impacted by insomnia requires delivering gold standard behavioral care, like CBT-I, and the reduction of sedative-hypnotics through innovative methods. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this feasibility clinical trial is to test a digital CBT-I approach combined with deprescribing to improve the success of sedative-hypnotic reduction among veterans. The intervention combines Noctem Health Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST), an effective and efficient, scalable, and adaptable digital platform to deliver CBT-I, with clinical pharmacy practitioner (CPP)-led deprescribing of sedative-hypnotic medications. METHODS: In this nonrandomized single-group clinical trial, 50 veterans will be recruited and enrolled to receive CBT-I delivered via Noctem COAST and CPP-led deprescribing for up to 12 weeks. Assessments will occur at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. The aims are to (1) assess the feasibility of recruiting veterans with chronic sedative-hypnotic use to participate in the combined intervention, (2) evaluate veterans' acceptability and usability of the COAST platform, and (3) measure changes in veterans' sleep, sedative-hypnotic use, and function at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: The institutional review board approved the study in October 2021 and the trial was initiated in May 2022. Recruitment and data collection began in September 2022 and is anticipated to be completed in April 2024. Aim 1 will be measured by tracking the response to a mail-centric recruitment approach using electronic medical records to identify potentially eligible veterans based on sedative-hypnotic use. Aim 2 will be measured using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire, assessing overall usability as well as system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality. Aim 3 will use the Insomnia Severity Index and sleep diaries to measure change in insomnia outcomes, the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Profile to measure change in physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles, pain, cognitive function, and self-reported sedative-hypnotic use to measure change in dose and frequency of use. CONCLUSIONS: Findings will inform the utility of a combined digital CBT-I and CPP-led deprescribing intervention and the development of an adequately powered clinical trial to test the effectiveness in a diverse sample of veterans. Further, findings will help inform potential new approaches to deliver care and improve access to care for veterans with insomnia, many of whom use sedative-hypnotics that may be ineffective and increase the risk for negative outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of 2 GET.ON interventions, GET.ON Mood Enhancer and GET.ON Stress, in a national digital mental health service implemented across Germany. METHODS: Following an initial web-based questionnaire, participants were allocated to either intervention based on their baseline symptom severity and personal choice and received a semistandardized guided, feedback-on-demand guided, or self-guided version of the treatment. Uncontrolled routine care data from 851 participants were analyzed using a pretest-posttest design. Half of the participants (461/851, 54.2%) were allocated to the stress intervention (189/461, 41% semistandardized; 240/461, 52% feedback on demand; and 32/461, 6.9% self-guided), and almost all participants in the mood intervention (349/352, 99.2%) received semistandardized guidance. RESULTS: Results on depression-related symptom severity indicated a reduction in reported symptoms, with a large effect size of d=-0.92 (95% CI -1.21 to -0.63). Results on perceived stress and insomnia indicated a reduction in symptom severity, with large effect sizes of d=1.02 (95% CI -1.46 to -0.58) and d=-0.75 (95% CI -1.10 to -0.40), respectively. A small percentage of participants experienced deterioration in depression-related symptoms (11/289, 3.8%), perceived stress (6/296, 2%), and insomnia (5/252, 2%). After completing treatment, 51.9% (150/289) of participants showed a clinically reliable change in depression-related symptoms, whereas 20.4% (59/289) achieved a close to symptom-free status. Similar improvements were observed in perceived stress and insomnia severity. Guidance moderated the effectiveness of and adherence to the interventions in reducing depressive symptom severity. Effect sizes on depression-related symptom severity were d=-1.20 (95% CI -1.45 to -0.93) for the semistandardized group, d=-0.36 (95% CI -0.68 to -0.04) for the feedback-on-demand group, and d=-0.83 (95% CI -1.03 to -0.63) for the self-guided group. Furthermore, 47.6% (405/851) of the participants completed all modules of the intervention. Participant satisfaction was high across all patient groups and both interventions; 89.3% (242/271) of participants would recommend it to a friend in need of similar help. Limitations include the assignment to treatments and guidance formats based on symptom severity. Furthermore, part of the differences in symptom change between groups must be assumed to be due to this baseline difference in the measures. CONCLUSIONS: Future digital health implementation and routine care research should focus on monitoring symptom deterioration and other negative effects, as well as possible predictors of deterioration and the investigation of individual patient trajectories. In conclusion, this study supports the effectiveness of tailored digital mental health services in routine care for depression- and stress-related symptoms in Germany. The results highlight the importance of guidance in delivering internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions and provide further evidence for its potential delivered as web-only solutions for increasing access to and use of psychological treatments."

This Review reports on a scoping review followed by a systematic review to consider interventions designed to address or manage depression or anxiety in children and young people up to the age of 25 years without the need to involve mental health professionals. The scoping review identified 132 approaches, 103 of which referred to children or young people (younger than 25 years). These approaches included social interaction, engagement with nature, relaxation, distraction, sensory stimulation, physical activity, altering perceptions, engaging in hobbies, self-expression, and exploration. A systematic review of effectiveness studies from the literature identified in the scoping review found only 38 studies on seven types of intervention that met the inclusion criteria. 16 studies were based on cognitive or behavioural principles (15 on digital interventions and one on bibliotherapy), ten focused on physical exercise, five on light therapy, three on dietary supplements, two on massage therapy, one on online peer support, and one on contact with a dog. Most studies focused on adolescents or young adults. Evidence suggested that light therapy could be effective for season depression and that digital interventions based on attention bias modification are ineffective for anxiety. Mixed evidence was available on the effectiveness of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety, and of physical exercise for depression. All other studies had insufficient certainty to obtain even tentative conclusions about effectiveness. These results highlight the disparity between the extensive range of approaches identified in the scoping review and the restricted number and focus found in the systematic review of effectiveness of these approaches. We call for an expanded research agenda that brings evaluation rigour to a wide range of self or community approaches."
10.2196/jmir.4145,Computerized Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Anxiety and Depression in Rural Areas: A Systematic Review,"Vallury KD, Jones M, Oosterbroek C.",J Med Internet Res,2015,2015.6.7,,,"BACKGROUND: People living in rural and remote communities have greater difficulty accessing mental health services and evidence-based therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), than their urban counterparts. Computerized CBT (CCBT) can be used to effectively treat depression and anxiety and may be particularly useful in rural settings where there are a lack of suitably trained practitioners. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the global evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of CCBT interventions for anxiety and/or depression for people living in rural and remote locations. METHODS: We searched seven online databases: Medline, Embase Classic and Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. We also hand searched reference lists, Internet search engines, and trial protocols. Two stages of selection were undertaken. In the first, the three authors screened citations. Studies were retained if they reported the efficacy, effectiveness or acceptability of CCBT for depression and/or anxiety disorders, were peer reviewed, and written in English. The qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 10, was then used to run automated text searches for the word ""rural,"" its synonyms, and stemmed words. All studies identified were read in full and were included in the study if they measured or meaningfully discussed the efficacy or acceptability of CCBT among rural participants. RESULTS: A total of 2594 studies were identified, of which 11 met the selection criteria and were included in the review. The studies that disaggregated efficacy data by location of participant reported that CCBT was equally effective for rural and urban participants. Rural location was found to both positively and negatively predict adherence across studies. CCBT may be more acceptable among rural than urban participants—studies to date showed that rural participants were less likely to want more face-to-face contact with a practitioner and found that computerized delivery addressed confidentiality concerns. CONCLUSIONS: CCBT can be effective for addressing depression and anxiety and is acceptable among rural participants. Further work is required to confirm these results across a wider range of countries, and to determine the most feasible model of CCBT delivery, in partnership with people who live and work in rural and remote communities."

AIM: To explore the landscape of IDPIs for late-life depression, examining current characteristics, psychotherapies, intervention strategies, facilitators, and barriers. METHOD: Guided by a PRISMA-guided scoping review, we systematically searched five electronic databases. RESULTS: 25 relevant studies were identified. IDPIs were used for treatment, prevention, and assessment. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy was the most common psychotherapy. Seven strategies to provide tailored services include psychotherapy courses, professional involvement, mood and progress tracking, virtual community, timed reminders, additional learning resources, and gamification elements. Barriers contained cognitive impairment, low digital literacy, device inaccessibility, limited depression awareness, adherence issues, and acclimation time, while facilitators included prior treatment experience, real-life character stories, strong client-worker bonds, and integration into daily care routines. CONCLUSION: IDPIs present an accessible and convenient avenue for older adults. Future directions suggest exploring minimalist interventions, diverse strategies, and optimized implementation to amplify IDPIs impact among this vulnerable group."

Single-session interventions (SSIs) are designed to be scalable and accessible, delivering core evidence-based intervention components within a one-off encounter. OBJECTIVE: COMET (Common Elements Toolbox) is an online self-help SSI that includes behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, gratitude, and self-compassion. COMET has previously been evaluated in India, Kenya, and the United States with promising results. This study tests the acceptability, appropriateness, perceived utility, and efficacy of COMET among UK university students during the peripandemic period. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of COMET compared with a control group, with 2- and 4-week follow-ups. Outcome variables were subjective well-being, depression severity, anxiety severity, positive affect, negative affect, and perceived stress. We also measured intervention satisfaction immediately after completion of COMET. All UK university students with access to the internet were eligible to participate and were informed of the study online. The data were analyzed using linear mixed models and reported in accordance with the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth) checklist. RESULTS: Of the 831 people screened, 468 participants were randomized to a condition, 407 completed the postintervention survey, 147 returned the 2-week follow-up survey, 118 returned the 4-week follow-up survey, and 89 returned both. Of the 239 randomized, 212 completed COMET. Significant between-group differences in favor of the COMET intervention were observed at 2-week follow-ups for subjective well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale; mean difference [MD] 1.39, 95% CI 0.19-2.61; P=.03), depression severity (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; MD -1.31, 95% CI -2.51 to -0.12; P=.03), and perceived stress (4-item Perceived Stress Scale; MD -1.33, 95% CI -2.10 to -0.57; P<.001). Overall, participants were satisfied with COMET, with the majority endorsing the intervention and its modules as acceptable, appropriate, and exhibiting high utility. The self-compassion module was most often reported as the participants' favorite module and the behavioral activation module was their least favorite. Qualitative analysis revealed that participants found COMET generally accessible, but too long, and experienced immediate and long-term beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high engagement with the COMET intervention, along with preliminary short-term efficacy. Almost all participants completed the intervention, but study attrition was high. Participant feedback indicated a high level of overall satisfaction with the intervention, with perceived accessibility, immediate benefits, and potential long-term impact being notable findings. These findings support the potential value of COMET as a mental health intervention and highlight important areas for further improvement.

This review aimed to: (i) examine the features and scientific evidence for e-mental health programs; (ii) describe the growth in these programs in the past decade, and track the extent and quality of scientific research over time; and (iii) examine Australian and international contribution to the field. METHOD: Two types of e-mental health programs; 'web interventions' and mobile applications'; targeting depression, bipolar disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety, panic disorder and general stress were included. Data were collected from the Beacon website (www.beacon.anu.edu.au; last updated July 2011). Features of each program and their supporting scientific evidence were coded. RESULTS: In total, 62 web interventions and 11 mobile applications were identified. Half of these were developed in Australia. The majority of programs were aimed towards adults and were based upon cognitive behavioural therapy. Approximately equal numbers of programs were developed for all targeted disorders except bipolar disorder, which was underrepresented. Only 35.5% of programs, all of which were web-based, had been evaluated by at least one RCT. The number of publications over the last decade is increasing. The majority were from Australian sources. Non-Australian research was lower in diversity and quantity. CONCLUSIONS: E-mental health research is increasing globally. Australia continues to be an international leader in this field. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder remain the disorders most targeted. Whilst the scientific evidence supporting e-mental health programs is growing, a substantial lack of high-quality empirical support was evident across the field, particularly for mobile applications and bipolar and social anxiety."

METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in multiple academic databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Keywords related to cognitive behavioral therapy, cultural adaptation, and specific populations were used. The inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pilot studies that assessed CA-CBT for various mental health conditions. RESULTS: The review included studies involving Chinese Americans, Latino caregivers, Syrian refugees, Jordanian children, Malaysian Muslims, Afghan refugees, Iraqi women, Japanese children and adolescents, and Tanzanian and Kenyan children. CA-CBT demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and psychosis. For instance, research has shown that CA-CBT is more effective than standard CBT in reducing depressive symptoms among Chinese Americans and in significantly lowering PTSD symptoms in Syrian refugee women. This method has been well-received and is feasible for use in diverse populations, such as Jordanian children and Afghan refugees. The long-term benefits are promising, with sustained improvements being reported in various studies. Additionally, digital and remote delivery methods have demonstrated potential for expanding the accessibility of CA-CBT. CONCLUSIONS: CA-CBT is a valuable and effective intervention for diverse cultural populations, significantly improving mental health outcomes. However, future research must address limitations such as small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and variability in assessment tools. Future studies should include larger and more diverse sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, rigorous control groups, and comprehensive outcome measures to further validate and enhance the application of CA-CBT across different cultural contexts."

Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users' levels of stress and depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% (16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and two. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available online-based interventions.

10.1016/j.invent.2021.100383,Involving patients' perspective in the development of an internet- and mobile-based CBT intervention for adolescents with chronic medical conditions: Findings from a qualitative study,"Geirhos A, Lunkenheimer F, Holl RW, Minden K, Schmitt A, Temming S, Baumeister H, Domhardt M.",Internet Interv,2021,2021.4.5,,,"OBJECTIVE: A user-centered approach is critical for increasing the adherence to and effectiveness of an internet- and mobile-based intervention program. Therefore, potential future intervention users were involved in the development of an internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (iCBT) for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with chronic medical conditions and comorbid symptoms of anxiety or depression. We aimed to identify challenges and coping strategies of the intended target group, as well as their needs and preferred intervention characteristics for an iCBT program. METHODS: Twenty AYA (aged 14-20, 60% females) with either type 1 diabetes (55%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (25%) or cystic fibrosis (20%) were interviewed in condition-specific focus groups (4-11 participants per group) either via videoconferencing or face-to-face. Transcript verbatim data was analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Frequently reported disease-specific burdens were among others fear of disease progression, non-acceptance of disease and stressful incidents related to and aversions against medical therapy. Most frequently reported coping strategies included, seeking social support and accepting the disease. Recommendations for the content of an iCBT for comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression comprised: dealing with disease-related fears and getting advice on health-promoting lifestyles. iCBT characteristics considered preferable by participants were: providing individual feedback by a real-person; implementation of a feature to monitor treatment progress; youthful and varied content presentation; time per session not exceeding 1 h; non-involvement of parents. A mobile-based reminder feature was considered useful, and individual tailoring and self-determination of iCBT content was considered desirable. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight important patient perspectives and age-specific recommendations which can help design more optimal iCBT interventions for AYA with chronic medical conditions."
10.1016/j.invent.2018.09.001,Internet- and mobile-based aftercare and relapse prevention in mental disorders: A systematic review and recommendations for future research,"Hennemann S, Farnsteiner S, Sander L.",Internet Interv,2018,2018.12.5,,,"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are characterized by a high likelihood of recurrence. Thus, aftercare and follow-up interventions aim to maintain treatment gains and to prevent relapse. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may represent promising instruments in tertiary prevention. This systematic review summarizes and evaluates the research on the efficacy of IMIs as aftercare or follow-up interventions for adults with mental health issues. METHODS: A systematic database search (PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CENTRAL) was conducted and studies selected according to predefined eligibility criteria (RCTs, adult population, clinical symptoms/disorder, assessed with validated instruments, clinical-psychological intervention rationale, aftercare/follow-up intervention, web-/mobile-based, minimum follow-up measurement of three months, inclusion of a control group). Inspected outcomes were symptom severity, recurrence- and rehospitalization rates, functioning, quality of life and adherence to primary treatment.Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42017055289. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria, covering trials on depression (n = 5), eating disorders (n = 4) and transdiagnostic interventions (n = 7). The majority of the interventions were based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles and were web-based (n = 11). Methodological quality of included studies was suboptimal. Limitations included attrition bias and non-specification of routine care co-interventions. IMIs yielded small to medium post-treatment effects for symptom severity (d = -0.08 - d = -0.45) in comparison to control groups. Best evidence base was found for symptom severity of depression and anxiety. Study results regarding recurrence and rehospitalization were inconsistent. DISCUSSION: There is some evidence, that IMIs are feasible instruments for maintaining treatment gains for some mental disorders. However, further high quality, large-scale trials are needed to expand research fields, improve adherence to and uptake of IMIs and facilitate implementation of effective interventions into routine care."
10.1186/s12978-022-01422-w,Transtheoretical model-based mobile health application for PCOS,"Wang L, Liu Y, Tan H, Huang S.",Reprod Health,2022,2022.5.13,,,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification (diet, exercise, and behavioral interventions) is the first-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The benefits of face-to-face lifestyle modification intervention in a short time have been demonstrated. However, few studies have investigated the mobile technology effects on lifestyle modification in PCOS. Therefore, we examined the effect of transtheoretical model-based mobile health application intervention program for PCOS. METHODS: A randomised controlled, single-blind trial, was carried out from October 2018 to March 2019, which included 122 participants recruited from gynecology outpatient clinics of affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University in Guizhou. The study participants were randomised into intervention (n = 61) and control groups (n = 61). Participants in the intervention group undertook a TTM-based mobile health application program in addition to routine care, and participants in the control group received only routine care. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants in the intervention group and 49 in the control group completed the study. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group showed statistically significant decrease for BMI (P < 0.05), WC (P < 0.05), SAS (P < 0.05), and SDS (P < 0.05) scores at 6-month and 12-month, respectively. Behavior stage change of exercise and diet among paticipants with PCOS was significant at 6 months (c2 = 43.032, P < 0.05) and 12th months (c2 = 49.574, P < 0.05) between the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the TTM-based mobile health application program can decrease BMI, WC, anxiety, and depression, and improve exercise and diet adherence in patients with PCOS in the long term. The TTM-based mobile health application program can be applied for lifestyle modification in women with PCOS. Trial registration This study was approved by the ethics committee NO.[2019]1-028 in March 2018 and was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (website: www.chictr.org.cn , registry number: ChiCTR2000034572). Plain Language Summary: Poor adherence of life management in patients with PCOS and many then go on to adherence poor health outcomes as a result. There is an urgent need for new approach to enhance to life management compliance for patients with PCOS. TTM is a common behavior change model, which can effectively promote the behavior change of patients, but it has not been used in the life management of PCOS patients. Meanwhile, the traditional life management of PCOS is mainly face-to-face intervention, few studies have investigated the mobile technology effects on lifestyle modification in PCOS. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of TTM-based mobile technology (for lifestyle modification) on the maintenance of health-related behavior changes among women with PCOS. This study confirmed that the TTM-based mobile health application program can decrease BMI, WC, anxiety, and depression, and improve exercise and diet adherence in patients with PCOS in the long term. Our study conducted TTM-based mobile health application program can provide a reference for other researchers or research organizations."

However, there is currently a paucity of studies on digital cognitive behavioral therapy as a treatment for insomnia. AIM: To assess digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia regarding its positive impact on brain function. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to either a go/no-go group or a dot-probe group. The primary outcome was quality of sleep as assessed by the actigraphy sleep monitoring bracelet, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), insomnia severity index (ISI), and depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Eighty patients were included in the analysis (go/no-go group: n = 40; dot-probe group: n = 40). We combined the total scale scores of the two groups before and after the intervention in the analysis of covariance. Our study explored whether insomnia symptoms in both groups can be improved by using digital cognitive behavioral therapy instead of trying to compare the two trials; therefore, only one P value is listed. In both groups, we found a short-term time effect on insomnia symptom severity (PSQI: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.336; ISI: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.667; DASS-depression: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.582; DASS-anxiety: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.337; DASS-stress: P < 0.001, η 2 = 0.443) and some effect on sleep efficiency (but it was not significant, P = 0.585, η 2 = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Go/no-go task training of inhibitory function had a short-term positive effect on sleep efficiency, whereas dot-probe task training had a positive short-term effect on emotion regulation."
10.1186/s13063-025-08826-6,Intensive 7-day internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for social anxiety disorder: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Steele KR, Upton E, Holden M, Regan A, Coleshill MJ, Li S, Joubert AE, Mahoney AEJ, Millard M, Newby JM.",Trials,2025,2025.4.18,,,"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a serious mental health disorder that when left untreated can lead to significant social, occupational, educational, and functional impairment. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the recommended first-line psychological treatment for SAD and has been shown to be efficacious in face-to-face and online formats. However, treatment is lengthy, and many people drop out prematurely. Pilot research suggests that brief intensive internet CBT (iCBT) for SAD is feasible and acceptable, but further evaluation using randomised controlled trials (RCT) is needed. METHODS: A RCT to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an intensive 7-day iCBT program for adults diagnosed with SAD (with or without comorbid major depressive disorder) in comparison to a waitlist control (WLC) is currently in progress. Eligible participants will be randomised to an intervention or WLC group. Participants allocated to the intervention will complete 6 iCBT modules over 7 days, with CBT skills practice each day, and clinician guidance provided remotely by telephone and email. Participants allocated to the WLC will be given access to the program after a 6-week waiting period. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 weeks post-baseline. Outcome measures will assess for social anxiety (SIAS, SPS), depression (PHQ-9), personality (LPFS, PID-5-BF), and functioning (WSAS). Intention-to-treat linear mixed model analyses will be used to evaluate primary and secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: Previous findings from a pilot trial showed that 7-day iCBT is feasible and acceptable to clients with SAD. Based on these findings, we expect the treatment group will improve significantly on measures of symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and functional impairment compared to the WLC, and these improvements will be sustained at 1-month follow-up. If demonstrated to be effective in this RCT, intensive 7-day iCBT for SAD is a novel way to deliver CBT more quickly, with potential to reach more clients and reduce drop-out rates. It has great potential to provide rapid symptom improvement to individuals with SAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on March 1, 2022 (ACTRN12622000361707)."

Heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate for autonomic nervous system activity, is a promising digital biomarker that has been linked to important outcomes. The objectives of this study were to prospectively describe the trajectory of HRV among AYAs receiving HCT and explore the association between HRV and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: This was a multi-site study embedded in a randomized trial among AYAs receiving HCT (NCT03640325). We collected sequential 24-h HRV metrics, including the standard deviation of normal-to-normal beats (SDNN), root-mean-square of successive differences (RMSSD), as well as frequency domain measures. PRO surveys queried anxiety, depression, quality of life, hope, and resilience at baseline and 3 months. We summarized outcomes using descriptive statistics, and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between HRV and PROs. RESULTS: Thirty-nine HRV recordings were collected from n = 16 participants aged 12-21 years. There was a moderately strong correlation between inferior baseline HRV and higher anxiety and depression (anxiety: r = -0.35 (p = 0.18) for SDNN, r = -0.47 (p = 0.07) for RMSSD; depression: r = -0.26 (p = 0.34) for SDNN, r = -0.39 (p = 0.14) for RMSSD). Among participants with elevated baseline anxiety, higher HRV suggested greater improvement in anxiety over time (r = -0.66 (p = 0.08) for SDNN, r = -0.31 (p = 0.45) for RMSSD). CONCLUSIONS: There was a correlation between HRV and PROs in this study, and among those with elevated anxiety, HRV predicted improvement over time. Digital biomarkers may augment behavioral intervention design and implementation."

Patient education can influence patient behavior that subsequently may lead to changes in attitudes and skills necessary for maintenance or improvement in management of symptom severity and quality of life. However, as postdiagnostic patient education can be resource demanding, assessment of digital approaches and verification of their effectiveness is warranted. OBJECTIVE: This cohort study aimed to investigate the effects of a digital web-based multidisciplinary eHealth program on the domains of symptom severity (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS]), quality of life (irritable bowel syndrome quality of life [IBS-QOL]), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and a measure of general client satisfaction (client satisfaction questionnaire), compared with an onsite multidisciplinary 2-day group-based education program (""IBS-school""), in 2 cohorts of 255 patients with IBS. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with IBS, aged 15-70 years, were enrolled after referral to the Section of Gastroenterology at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. In total, 132 patients were recruited to the eHealth program and 123 to the IBS-school group for comparison. Data were self-reported and collected digitally at enrollment and after 3 months, between 2017 and 2019. Furthermore, 71 attending the eHealth program and 49 attending the IBS-school completed the questionnaires at 3 months. Intervention response was defined as a reduction of ≥50 points on the IBS-SSS. RESULTS: Patients attending the eHealth program reported a significant reduction in IBS symptom severity 3 months after treatment (n=71), compared with patients attending the IBS-school (n=50). Overall, patients categorized as intervention responders in both programs showed a significant reduction in symptom severity at 3 months. Here, 41% (29/71) of patients attending the eHealth program reported a mean IBS-SSS reduction of 103 (SD 72.0) points (P<.001). In addition, these patients reported reduced anxiety (P>.001) and depression (P=.002) and enhanced quality of life (P=.03), especially the degrees of dysphoria, body image, food avoidance, health worry, interference with activity, relations, and social relations. Patients responding to the IBS-school intervention (18/50, 36%) reported a mean IBS-SSS reduction of 119 (SD 86.2) points (P<.001), and reduced depression scores (P=.046), but no difference in overall quality of life. Both groups reported the respective interventions as ""good"" quality health care programs, scoring them 23.5 (SD 4)-the eHealth program 23.5 (SD 4), and the IBS-school 24.2 (SD 4)-on the client satisfaction questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the digital multidisciplinary eHealth program has a significant effect on IBS symptom severity in a portion of patients; it is useful as a tool in disease self-management and does not result in worse symptom scores than an onsite multidisciplinary 2-day group-based education program after 3 months. We believe these results indicate that a digital eHealth approach is preferable to an onsite multidisciplinary 2-day group-based education program covering the same topics."

Digitalization of various services has brought a paradigm shift in consumerism. Treading this path, mental health practice has gradually moved to Digital Mental Health Interventions (DMHI), to improve service access and delivery. Applied games are one such innovation that has gained recent popularity in psychiatry. Based on the principles of gamification, they target psychosocial and cognitive domains, according to the deficits in various psychiatric disorders. They have been used to deliver cognitive behaviour therapy, cognitive training and rehabilitation, behavioural modification, social motivation, attention enhancement, and biofeedback. Research shows their utility in ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress, impulse control disorders, depression, schizophrenia, dementia, and even healthy aging. Virtual reality and artificial intelligence have been used in conjunction with gaming interventions to improvise their scope. Even though these interventions hold promise in engagement, ease of use, reduction of stigma, and bridging the mental-health gap, there are pragmatic challenges, especially in developing countries. These include network quality, infrastructure, feasibility, socio-cultural adaptability, and potential for abuse. Keeping this in the background, this review summarizes the scope, promise, and evidence of digital gaming in psychiatric practice, and highlights the potential caveats in their implementation."
10.1111/jsr.13888,Digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia in individuals with self-reported insomnia and chronic fatigue: A secondary analysis of a large scale randomized controlled trial,"Ramfjord LS, Faaland P, Scott J, Saksvik SB, Lydersen S, Vedaa Ø, Kahn N, Langsrud K, Stiles TC, Ritterband LM, Harvey AG, Sivertsen B, Kallestad H.",J Sleep Res,2023,2023.3.22,,,"Insomnia is associated with fatigue, but it is unclear whether response to cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia is altered in individuals with co-occurring symptoms of insomnia and chronic fatigue. This is a secondary analysis using data from 1717 participants with self-reported insomnia in a community-based randomized controlled trial of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia compared with patient education. We employed baseline ratings of the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire to identify participants with more or fewer symptoms of self-reported chronic fatigue (chronic fatigue, n = 592; no chronic fatigue, n = 1125). We used linear mixed models with Insomnia Severity Index, Short Form-12 mental health, Short Form-12 physical health, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale separately as outcome variables. The main covariates were main effects and interactions for time (baseline versus 9-week follow-up), intervention, and chronic fatigue. Participants with chronic fatigue reported significantly greater improvements following digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia compared with patient education on the Insomnia Severity Index (Cohen's d = 1.36, p < 0.001), Short Form-12 mental health (Cohen's d = 0.19, p = 0.029), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Cohen's d = 0.18, p = 0.010). There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia between chronic fatigue and no chronic fatigue participants on any outcome. We conclude that in a large community-based sample of adults with insomnia, co-occurring chronic fatigue did not moderate the effectiveness of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia on any of the tested outcomes. This may further establish digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia as an adjunctive intervention in individuals with physical and mental disorders."

Although unguided digital SSIs have shown promise in the treatment of youth psychopathology, the data are more mixed regarding their efficacy in adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of COMET-SSI versus a waiting list control in depression and other transdiagnostic mental health outcomes for Prolific participants with a history of psychopathology. METHODS: We conducted an investigator-blinded, preregistered randomized controlled trial comparing COMET-SSI (n=409) with an 8-week waiting list control (n=419). Participants were recruited from the web-based workspace Prolific and assessed for depression, anxiety, work and social functioning, psychological well-being, and emotion regulation at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the intervention. The main outcomes were short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (8 weeks) changes in depression and anxiety. The secondary outcomes were the 8-week changes in work and social functioning, well-being, and emotion regulation. Analyses were conducted according to the intent-to-treat principle with imputation, without imputation, and using a per-protocol sample. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses to identify inattentive responders. RESULTS: The sample comprised 61.9% (513/828) of women, with a mean age of 35.75 (SD 11.93) years. Most participants (732/828, 88.3%) met the criteria for screening for depression or anxiety using at least one validated screening scale. A review of the text data suggested that adherence to the COMET-SSI was near perfect, there were very few inattentive respondents, and satisfaction with the intervention was high. However, despite being powered to detect small effects, there were negligible differences between the conditions in the various outcomes at the various time points, even when focusing on subsets of individuals with more severe symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the use of the COMET-SSI in adult Prolific participants. Future work should explore alternate ways of intervening with paid web-based participants, including matching individuals to SSIs they may be most responsive to.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia self-help interventions could increase availability, especially if unguided. Optimizing cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia methods and system user-friendliness, we developed a short, digital, self-help programme-FastAsleep-based on the behavioural components of sleep restriction and stimulus control. This study investigated its feasibility and preliminary effects. Thirty media-recruited participants with moderate to severe insomnia were assessed via telephone before using FastAsleep for 4 weeks, and were interviewed afterwards. Self-ratings with web questionnaires were conducted at screening, pre-, mid- and post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were feasibility (credibility, adherence, system user-friendliness and adverse effects), and secondary outcomes were changes in symptom severity (insomnia, depression and anxiety). Adherence was generally high, participants' feasibility ratings were favourable, and adverse effects matched previously reported levels for cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. Symptoms of insomnia decreased after the treatment period (Hedge's g = 1.79, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-2.39), as did symptoms of depression and anxiety. FastAsleep can be considered feasible and promising for alleviating insomnia symptoms among patients fit for self-care. Future controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of FastAsleep and its suitability in a stepped care model."

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of digital psychological interventions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unclear. We aimed to systematically investigate the available evidence for digital psychological interventions in reducing mental health problems in LMICs. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control conditions (Hedges'g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019137755. FINDINGS: We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study population was 20-35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when compared with control interventions (Hedges'g 0·60 [95% CI 0·45-0·75]; Hedges'g with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 0·54 [0·35-0·73]). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I2=74% [95% CI 60-83]). There was no evidence of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was generally high. INTERPRETATION: Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs. However, the considerable heterogeneity observed in our analysis highlights the need for more studies to be done, with standardised implementation of digital psychological intervention programmes to improve their reproducibility and efficiency. Digital psychological interventions should be considered for regions where usual care for mental health problems is minimal or absent. FUNDING: None.

10.2196/27965,Engagement and Effectiveness of a Healthy-Coping Intervention via Chatbot for University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Proof-of-Concept Study,"Gabrielli S, Rizzi S, Bassi G, Carbone S, Maimone R, Marchesoni M, Forti S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021.5.5,,,"BACKGROUND: University students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and they frequently face barriers to seeking psychological support because of stigma, cost, and availability of mental health services. This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of university students. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement Scale-Short Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention. RESULTS: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement (10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t39=0.94; P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t39=2.00; P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the benefit of deploying a digital healthy-coping intervention via a chatbot to support university students experiencing higher levels of distress. While findings collected during the COVID-19 pandemic show promise, further research is required to confirm conclusions."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, engagement, durability, and adaptability of dCBT-I. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using longitudinal data collected via a mobile app named Good Sleep 365 between November 14, 2018, and February 28, 2022. Three therapeutic modes (ie, dCBT-I, medication, and their combination) were compared at month 1, month 3, and month 6 (primary). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores was applied to enable homogeneous comparisons between the 3 groups. EXPOSURES: Treatment with dCBT-I, medication therapy, or combination therapy according to prescriptions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score and its essential subitems were used as the primary outcomes. Effectiveness on comorbid somnolence, anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms were used as secondary outcomes. Cohen d effect size, P value, and standardized mean difference (SMD) were used to measure differences in treatment outcomes. Changes in outcomes and response rates (≥3 points change in PSQI score) were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 4052 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.29 [12.01] years; 3028 [74.7%] female participants) were selected for dCBT-I (n = 418), medication (n = 862), and their combination (n = 2772). Compared with the change in PSQI score at 6 months for participants receiving medication alone (from a mean [SD] of 12.85 [3.49] to 8.92 [4.03]), both dCBT-I (from a mean [SD] of 13.51 [3.03] to 7.15 [3.25]; Cohen d, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.38; P < .001; SMD = 0.484) and combination therapy (from a mean [SD] of 12.92 [3.49] to 6.98 [3.43]; Cohen d, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.58; P < .001; SMD = 0.518) were associated with significant reductions; dCBT-I had a comparable effect as combination therapy (Cohen d, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.15; P = .66; SMD = 0.05), but showed unstable durability. Outcomes of dCBT-I improved steadily and rapidly during the first 3 months, and then fluctuated. The response rates with dCBT-I and combination therapy were higher than with medication. Changes in secondary outcomes indicated statistically significant benefits from dCBT-I and combination therapy. The results of subgroup analysis were consistent with the main findings, demonstrating the superiority of dCBT-I vs medication therapy in various subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, clinical evidence suggested that combination therapy was optimal, and dCBT-I was more effective than medication therapy, with long-term benefits for insomnia. Future studies are needed to analyze its clinical effectiveness and reliability in distinct subpopulations."

A systematic review,"Stefanopoulou E, Hogarth H, Taylor M, Russell-Haines K, Lewis D, Larkin J.",J Ment Health,2020,2020.1.29,,,"Background: There is a significant lack of outcomes research examining the effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing suicidal ideation and self-harm.Aims: To systematically review the effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing suicidal ideation and self-harm in adult populations. The possible mediating effects of depression are also discussed.Methods: The databases Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, IEEEXplore, ACM and CRESP were searched. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and risk of bias using standard assessment criteria.Results: Fourteen RCTs were reviewed, reporting data on 3455 participants. Although findings were more consistent for the effectiveness of online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness-Based CBT and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there was insufficient research to consider any as evidence-based treatments for suicidal ideation and self-harm.Conclusions: Digital interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm can be a safe and acceptable option for individuals unwilling or unable to access face-to-face interventions. However, further research is needed to understand the types of interventions that could support people and the risk-benefit ratio of digital interventions for these individuals."

Behavioural technology adequately integrated into clinical care delivery has potential to improve care access and efficiency. This multisite randomised controlled trial evaluates how a coach-enhanced digital cognitive behavioural intervention (dCBI) enhances usual care for depressed AYAs in paediatric practices with minority enriched samples. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants (n=750) ages 16-22 who meet threshold criteria for depressive severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9 score 10-24) will be recruited through paediatric practices across three academic institutions (Boston, Pittsburgh and San Diego). Participants will be randomised to 12 weeks of dCBI+treatment as usual (TAU) (n=450) or TAU alone (n=300) in outpatient paediatric practices. Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks with the primary outcome being improvement in clinician-rated and self-reported depressive severity (Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and PHQ-9) and secondary outcomes being self-reported suicidal ideation (item 9 on PHQ-9), anxiety severity (Generalised Anxiety Disorder), general quality of life (Satisfaction with Life Scale) and general functioning (Children's Global Assessment Scale). The study design is an intent-to-treat mixed effects regression with group, and covariates nested within the sites. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All participants or their parent/guardian (under 18 years or unemancipated) will give informed consent to a study team member. All data are expected to be collected over 18 months. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a board at each institution in the United States that reviews and monitors research involving human subjects. IRB approval from the University of Pittsburgh was obtained on 30 November 2021 (STUDY21080150), from the University of California San Diego's Human Research Protection Program IRB on 14 July 2022 (802047), and from the Boston Children's Hospital IRB on 25 October 2022 (P00040987). Full study results are planned to be published within 2 years of initial study recruitment (October 2024). Dissemination of findings will occur in peer-reviewed journals, professional conferences and through reports to participating entities and stakeholders.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.921527,Benefits of Digital Mental Health Care Interventions for Correctional Workers and Other Public Safety Personnel: A Narrative Review,"Moghimi E, Knyahnytska Y, Omrani M, Nikjoo N, Stephenson C, Layzell G, Frederic Simpson AI, Alavi N.",Front Psychiatry,2022,2022.7.25,,,"Chronic exposure to stressors and potentially psychologically traumatic events contributes to the high prevalence of mental health disorders in correctional workers (CWs) and other public safety personnel (PSP). Digital mental health interventions are an accessible and scalable method of improving and maintaining the mental health of this population. The current review explores the benefits of digital mental health interventions for PSP-with a focus on CWs-and how these innovations can address the limitations in in-person mental health care. A systematic literature search of five databases (Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar) was conducted until March 2022. The search yielded 16 publications that focused on digital mental health interventions or care available to CWs and other PSP. The benefits of digital innovations were summarized into five categories which discussed (1) their ability to enhance accessibility and reduce stigma; (2) the provision of evidence-based and structured psychotherapy programs; (3) variability in the degree of therapist engagement; (4) the integration of proactive interventions; and (5) enhancing engagement by acknowledging unique experiences and interpersonal relationships. Although digital mental health technologies for CWs are still in their infancy, there is strong evidence to support their effectiveness in ameliorating symptoms of mental distress. Future research should consider how ethnicity, gender, culture, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status can be integrated into these therapies and how the interplay between different stakeholders and organizations can impact the effectiveness of online therapies and programs."

There is a lack of digital interventions tailored to the needs of people living with all types of cancer. We developed a 6-week, digital, peer-delivered, self-management program: iHOPE (Help to Overcome Problems Effectively; where 'i' indicates the digital version of the program). The program is underpinned by positive psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy to meet these psychosocial challenges. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the iHOPE program among people living with cancer. Program adherence and satisfaction along with changes in psychological distress and positive well-being were measured. METHODS: A pre-post, acceptability, and feasibility design was used. People living with cancer (N=114) were recruited via a national cancer charity in the United Kingdom and were given access to the iHOPE program. Demographic and other participant characteristics were recorded. Participants completed digital measures at baseline and the end of the 6-week program for depression, anxiety, cancer-related fatigue, cancer worry or fear of cancer recurrence, positive mental well-being, hope, gratitude, and health status. The website's system recorded data on the usage of the program. Satisfaction with the program was also measured. RESULTS: A total of 114 participants completed the baseline questionnaires. Of these, 70 people (61.4%) participated in all 6 sessions. The mean number of sessions undertaken was 5.0 (SD 1.5). Moreover, 44.7% (51/114) of participants completed at least three sessions and end-of-program outcome measures. A total of 59 participants completed the satisfaction questionnaire, where ≥90% (54/58) of participants reported that the program was easy to navigate and was well managed by the peer facilitators, and that they found the social networking tools useful. Preliminary efficacy testing among the 51 participants who completed baseline and postprogram outcome measures showed that postprogram scores decreased for depression, anxiety, cancer-related fatigue, and fear of recurrence (all P<.001) and increased for positive mental well-being (P<.001), hope (both P<.001), and gratitude (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility evidence is promising, showing that the peer-delivered digital iHOPE program is acceptable and practical. Implementation of the iHOPE program on a wider scale will incorporate further research and development to maximize the completion rates of the measures. Initial effectiveness data suggest positive impacts on important cancer-related quality of life and mental well-being outcomes. A randomized controlled trial design with a longer follow-up is needed to confirm the potential of the iHOPE program for improving mental and physical health outcomes for cancer survivors."

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is a promising but understudied approach for treating depression among older adults with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the experiences of homebound older adults who participated in a pilot feasibility trial of an iCBT for depression. METHODS: The participants included 21 homebound older adults who participated in a generic iCBT program that was not specifically designed for older adults and 8 home care workers who assisted in the iCBT program. Informants completed semistructured individual interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using methods informed by grounded theory. A hierarchical code structure of themes and subthemes was developed after an iterative process of constant comparisons and questionings of the initial codes. The data analysis was conducted by using dedoose, a web app for mixed methods research. RESULTS: Three themes and various subthemes emerged related to participants' experience of the iCBT intervention, as follows: intervention impact, which involved subthemes related to participants' perceived impact of the intervention; challenges and difficulties, which involved subthemes on the challenges and difficulties that participants experienced in the intervention; and facilitators, which involved subthemes on the factors that facilitated intervention use and engagement. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT is a promising intervention for homebound older adults experiencing depression. Home care workers reported improved relationships with their clients and that the program did not add a burden to their duties. Future programs should involve accessible technical features and age-adapted content to improve user experience, uptake, and adherence.

10.1177/26334895211053659,The Implementation and Effectiveness of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Primary Care: A Pilot Study,"Hermes EDA, Rosenheck RA, Burrone L, Dante G, Lukens C, Martino S.",Implement Res Pract,2021,2023.4.24,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions delivering Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (Digital CBTi) may increase utilization of effective care for a common and serious condition. A low-intensity implementation strategy may facilitate digital CBTi use in healthcare settings. This pilot study assessed the feasibility of implementing a digital CBTi in Veterans Health Administration (VA) primary care through iterative modifications to a low-intensity implementation strategy, while evaluating clinical outcomes of a specific digital CBTi program. METHODS: A self-directed digital CBTi was implemented in the primary care clinics of a single VA facility using a cohort trial design that iteratively modified an implementation strategy over three 8-month phases. The phase 1 implementation strategy included (1) provider education; (2) point-of-care information via pamphlets; and (3) provider referral to digital CBTi through phone calls or messages. Phases 2 and 3 maintained these activities, while (1) adding a clinic-based coach who performed initial patient education and follow-up support contacts, (2) providing additional recruitment pathways, and (3) integrating the referral mechanism into provider workflow. Implementation outcomes included provider adoption, patient adoption, and acceptability. Clinical outcomes (insomnia severity, depression severity, and sedative hypnotic use) were compared among enrollees at baseline and 10 weeks. RESULTS: Across all phases 66 providers (48.9%) made 153 referrals, representing 0.38% of unique clinic patients. Of referrals, 77 (50.3%) enrolled in the study, 45 (29.4%) engaged in the program, and 24 (15.7%) completed it. Provider and patient adoption did not differ meaningfully across phases. Among enrollees, digital CBTi was acceptable and the Insomnia Severity Index decreased by 4.3 points (t = 6.41, p < 0.001) and 13 (18.6%) reached remission. The mean number of weakly sedative-hypnotic doses decreased by 2.2 (35.5%) (t = 2.39, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Digital CBTi implementation in VA primary care is feasible using low-intensity implementation strategy, resulting in improved clinical outcomes for users. However, iterative implementation strategy modifications did not improve adoption.The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03151083)."

Therapies aimed at reducing cognitive arousal may benefit pregnant women with insomnia. This proof-of-concept trial evaluated Perinatal Understanding of Mindful Awareness for Sleep (PUMAS, which combines mindfulness with behavioral sleep strategies) on insomnia, depression, and cognitive arousal. METHODS: A single-arm trial of 12 pregnant women with DSM-5 insomnia disorder (n = 5/12 with comorbid depression) who received six sessions of PUMAS delivered individually via telemedicine. Pretreatment and posttreatment outcomes included the insomnia severity index (ISI), Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS), pre-sleep arousal scale's cognitive factor (PSASC; nocturnal cognitive arousal), perinatal-focused rumination (appended to PSASC), and Glasgow sleep effort scale. RESULTS: Eleven of 12 patients completed all sessions. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed a 10.83-point reduction in ISI (Cohen's dz = 3.05), resulting in 83.3% insomnia remission. PUMAS produced large reductions in EPDS (Cohen's dz = 2.76 in depressed group), resulting in all five baseline depressed patients remitting from depression. PUMAS produced large reductions in nocturnal cognitive arousal, perinatal-focused rumination, and sleep effort (all Cohen's dzs>2.00). Patients were highly satisfied with PUMAS and identified the telemedicine format and meditation app as positive features of its delivery. Patients rated sleep restriction and guided meditations as the most helpful treatment components. CONCLUSION: Prenatal insomnia patients were highly engaged in PUMAS, which produced large acute reductions in insomnia, depression, and cognitive arousal. These findings support the concept and feasibility of PUMAS for pregnant women with insomnia who present with or without comorbid depression. GOV ID: NCT04443959."

In cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the current gold-standard psychotherapeutic treatment for depression, cognitive restructuring techniques are employed to address dysfunctional cognitions. However, high drop-out and non-response rates suggest a need to boost the efficacy of CBT for depression. This might be achieved by enhancing the role of emotional and kinesthetic (i.e., body movement perception) features of interventions. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive restructuring task augmented with the performance of anti-depressive facial expressions in individuals with and without depression. Further, we aim to investigate to what extent kinesthetic markers are intrinsically associated with and, hence, allow for the detection of, depression. METHODS: In a four-arm, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will randomize 128 individuals with depression and 128 matched controls without depression to one of four study conditions: (1) a cognitive reappraisal training (CR); (2) CR enhanced with instructions to display anti-depressive facial expressions (CR + AFE); (3) facial muscle training focusing on anti-depressive facial expressions (AFE); and (4) a sham control condition. One week after diagnostic assessment, a single intervention of 90-120-minute duration will be administered, with a subsequent follow-up two weeks later. Depressed mood will serve as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include current positive mood, symptoms of depression, current suicidality, dysfunctional attitudes, automatic thoughts, emotional state, kinesthesia (i.e., facial expression, facial muscle activity, body posture), psychophysiological measures (e.g., heart rate (variability), respiration rate (variability), verbal acoustics), as well as feasibility measures (i.e., treatment integrity, compliance, usability, acceptability). Outcomes will be analyzed with multiple methods, such as hierarchical and conventional linear models and machine learning. DISCUSSION: If shown to be feasible and effective, the inclusion of kinesthesia into both psychotherapeutic diagnostics and interventions may be a pivotal step towards the more prompt, efficient, and targeted treatment of individuals with depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was preregistered in the Open Science Framework on August 12, 2022 ( https://osf.io/mswfg/ ) and retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on November 25, 2024.

However, poor provider and patient adherence characterize most measurement-based care tools. Therefore, a new approach for measuring intervention effects and communicating them to providers in a seamless manner is warranted. This paper provides a brief overview of the available research evidence on novel ways to measure the effects of behavioral treatments, integrating both objective and subjective data. We highlight the importance of analyzing therapeutic conversations through natural language processing. We then suggest a conceptual framework for capitalizing on data captured through directly collected and nondisruptive methodologies to describe the client's characteristics and needs and inform clinical decision-making. We then apply this context in exploring a new tool to integrate the content of therapeutic conversations and patients' self-reports. We present a case study of how both subjective and objective measures of treatment effects were implemented in cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression and anxiety and then utilized in treatment planning, delivery, and termination. In this tool, called Eleos, the patient completes standardized measures of depression and anxiety. The content of the treatment sessions was evaluated using nondisruptive, independent measures of conversation content, fidelity to the treatment model, and the back-and-forth of client-therapist dialogue. Innovative applications of advances in digital health are needed to disseminate empirically supported interventions and measure them in a noncumbersome way. Eleos appears to be a feasible, sustainable, and effective way to assess behavioral health care."

Concerns about the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been widespread and provide a unique impetus to examine the utility and responsivity of DMHS. This study examined the service utilisation and user characteristics of two DMHS (THIS WAY UP and Just a Thought) in Australia and New Zealand before and during the early pandemic period in these countries (March to June 2020). METHODS: Service use indices (website visits, course registrations and prescriptions, clinician registrations) were compared across different time periods before (12, 6 and 3 months) and during the pandemic in Australia and New Zealand. The demographic and clinical characteristics of course registrants (anxiety and depression symptom severity and psychological distress) were also compared across the pre- and during-COVID periods. RESULTS: Comparing pre-COVID to during-COVID time periods, we observed substantial increases across all service use indices in both DMHS (increases of >100% on the majority of service use indices). For example, in the 3 months prior to the pandemic, 2806 people registered for a THIS WAY UP course and 1907 people registered for a Just a Thought course, whereas 21,872 and 5442 registered for a THIS WAY UP and Just a Thought course, respectively, during the first 3 months of the COVID pandemic. Slight differences in the demographic and clinical profiles of course registrants were found between pre- and during-COVID time periods, with limited evidence of elevated anxiety and depression symptom severity in the COVID period. CONCLUSIONS: Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Australia and New Zealand, the volume of users accessing DMHS increased yet the demographic and clinical characteristics of course registrants remained stable. Results underscore how nimble and scalable DMHS can be during periods of high demand."

Despite the high prevalence of depression, unacceptable treatment access disparities persist. When depression goes untreated, it leads to substantial negative impacts in multiple life domains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychosocial treatment for depression, remains largely unavailable to individuals living with depression, particularly individuals who are members of underrepresented groups in our society. Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) have led to important advances in extending the reach of CBT for depression; however, they are underutilized and treatment engagement remains low. We sought to address some of the current gaps in DMHI by developing an online platform for delivering CBT for depression that is entertaining, simple and straightforward, and tailorable. First, this article introduces our online platform, Entertain Me Well (EMW) and its key innovations, including the use of an engaging, character-driven storyline presented as ""episodes"" within each session, as well as customizable content that allows for tailoring of text, images, and examples to create content most relevant to the target client population, context, or setting. Next, we describe two EMW depression treatment programs that have been tailored: one for delivery in the rural church setting, called Raising Our Spirits Together, and one tailored for delivery in dialysis centers, called Doing Better on Dialysis. Finally, we discuss future directions for the EMW platform, including the ability to create programs for other common mental health and health conditions, the development of additional character-driven storylines with greater treatment personalization, translation of content in multiple languages, and the use of additional technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence like natural language processing, to enhance platform interactivity."

Six databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL) were searched for randomized controlled trials published from database inception to March 2023. Mind-body IMIs included cognitive behavioral therapy, breathwork, meditation, mindfulness, yoga or Tai-chi. To focus on interventions with a greater potential for scale, the intervention delivery needed to be online with no or limited facilitation by study personnel. The primary outcome was mean change scores for anxiety and depression (Hedges' g). In subgroup analyses, random-effects models were used to calculate pooled effect size estimates based on personnel support level, intervention techniques, chronic physical condition, and survey type. Meta-regression was conducted on age and intervention length. Fifty-six studies met inclusion criteria (sample size 7691, mean age of participants 43 years, 58% female): 30% (n = 17) neurological conditions, 12% (n = 7) cardiovascular conditions, 11% cancer (n = 6), 43% other chronic physical conditions (n = 24), and 4% (n = 2) multiple chronic conditions. Mind-body IMIs demonstrated statistically significant pooled reductions in depression (SMD = -0.33 [-0.40, -0.26], p<0.001) and anxiety (SMD = -0.26 [-0.36, -0.17], p<0.001). Heterogeneity was moderate. Scalable mind-body IMIs hold promise as interventions for managing anxiety and depression symptoms in adults with chronic physical conditions without differences seen with age or intervention length. While modest, the effect sizes are comparable to those seen with pharmacological therapy. The field would benefit from detailed reporting of participant demographics including those related to technological proficiency, as well as further evaluation of non-CBT interventions.

10.1002/wps.20218,Telemental health: A status update,"Aboujaoude E, Salame W, Naim L.",World Psychiatry,2015,2015.6.5,,,"A rather large body of literature now exists on the use of telemental health services in the diagnosis and management of various psychiatric conditions. This review aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of telemental health, focusing on four main areas: computerized CBT (cCBT), Internet-based CBT (iCBT), virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), and mobile therapy (mTherapy). Four scientific databases were searched and, where possible, larger, better-designed meta-analyses and controlled trials were highlighted. Taken together, published studies support an expanded role for telepsychiatry tools, with advantages that include increased care access, enhanced efficiency, reduced stigma associated with visiting mental health clinics, and the ability to bypass diagnosis-specific obstacles to treatment, such as when social anxiety prevents a patient from leaving the house. Of technology-mediated therapies, cCBT and iCBT possess the most efficacy evidence, with VRET and mTherapy representing promising but less researched options that have grown in parallel with virtual reality and mobile technology advances. Nonetheless, telepsychiatry remains challenging because of the need for specific computer skills, the difficulty in providing patients with a deep understanding or support, concerns about the ""therapeutic alliance"", privacy fears, and the well documented problem of patient attrition. Future studies should further test the efficacy, advantages and limitations of technology-enabled CBT, as well as explore the online delivery of other psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological modalities."
10.1093/sleep/zsad184,The clinical effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in a heterogenous study sample: results from a randomized controlled trial,"Schuffelen J, Maurer LF, Lorenz N, Rötger A, Pietrowsky R, Gieselmann A.",Sleep,2023,2023.7.10,,,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies worldwide have reported the beneficial effects of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I). However, few focus on real-world study samples that reflect people in regular care. To test whether dCBT-I is suitable within German regular care, we designed a randomized controlled trial recruiting a heterogenous insomnia population. METHODS: Participants aged ≥18 who met the criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to 8-weeks dCBT-I + care-as-usual (CAU) or they were set on a waitlist + CAU. The intervention group was followed-up at 6- and 12-months. The primary outcome was self-reported insomnia severity, assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at 8-weeks post-randomization. A one-way ANCOVA with baseline score as a covariate was fitted to determine group differences. Secondary outcomes included measures of daytime functioning, quality of life, depression, anxiety, dreams, and nightmares. RESULTS: Of the N = 238 participants (67.6% female), age range 19-81 years, n = 118 were randomized to dCBT-I and n = 120 to the control group. At posttreatment, the use of dCBT-I was associated with a large reduction in the ISI (Diffadj = -7.60) in comparison to WLC (d = -2.08). This clinical improvement was also reflected in responder and remission rates. Treatment effects were also observed for daytime functioning, quality of life, symptoms of depression and anxiety (ds = 0.26-1.02) and at long-term follow-up (intervention group only; ds = 0.18-1.65). No effects were found for dream and nightmare frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that dCBT-I reduces insomnia symptoms and improves daytime functioning in a heterogenous insomnia population in Germany with sustained long-term treatment effects in the intervention group. Our results underscore the potential of digital health applications, their suitability within regular care, and their role in facilitating widespread implementation of CBT-I as a first-line treatment for insomnia."
10.1080/14737175.2018.1400381,Long-term effects of internet-supported cognitive behaviour therapy,"Andersson G, Rozental A, Shafran R, Carlbring P.",Expert Rev Neurother,2018,2017.11.3,,,"Internet-supported and therapist-guided cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is effective for a range of problems in the short run, but less is known about the long-term effects with follow-ups of two years or longer. Areas covered: This paper reviews studies in which the long-term effects of guided ICBT were investigated. Following literature searches in PubMed and other sources meta-analytic statistics were calculated for 14 studies involving a total of 902 participants, and an average follow-up period of three years. Studies were from Sweden (n = 11) or the Netherlands (n = 3). Long-term outcome studies were found for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, mixed anxiety and depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, pathological gambling, stress and chronic fatigue. The duration of the treatments was usually short (8-15 weeks). The pre-to follow-up effect size was Hedge's g = 1.52, but with a significant heterogeneity. The average symptom improvement across studies was 50%. Treatment seeking in the follow-up period was not documented and few studies mentioned negative effects. Expert commentary: While effects may be overestimated, it is likely that therapist-supported ICBT can have enduring effects. Long-term follow-up data should be collected for more conditions and new technologies like smartphone-delivered treatments."

Several studies exist describing the benefits and advantages of this technology as a complement to psychotherapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder, to name a few. A small number of these works implement capabilities in the virtual agent focused on the detection and prevention of suicidality risks. The work presented in this paper describes the development of an embodied conversational agent used as the main interface in HelPath, a mobile-based application addressed to individuals detected with any of the suicidal behaviours: ideation, planning or attempt. The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's information that, complemented with data from the electronic health record, supports the identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the virtual agent, the users also receive information and suggestions based on cognitive behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy condition. The paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to assess the acceptability, perception and adherence of users towards the virtual agent. The obtained results are presented and discussed, and some actions for further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified."

Nowadays, there are only three DTx officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration for mental conditions and there are still very few DTx developed in the context of mood disorders. The current comprehensive overview aims at providing a summary of currently published studies on DTx clinical applications in major depressive disorder (MDD), depressive symptomatology and bipolar disorder (BD), by using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Fifteen studies have been selected (10 on DTx in depressive symptomatology and/or MDD; 4 on BD; 1 on MDD and BD). Literature on DTx in mood disorders is still lacking, being mostly constituted by feasibility and acceptability rather than efficacy/effectiveness outcomes, particularly in BD. More studies focused on MDD compared to BD. Most DTx on MDD have been developed based on cognitive behaviour therapy interventions while on BD are based on psychoeducation. All studies assessing symptom severity improvement pre- vs. postinterventions demonstrated a significant postintervention improvement. Therefore, despite the preliminary encouraging results of studies here retrieved, their methodology is still too heterogeneous to allow comparisons and the generalizability of their findings. Further studies are warranted, in more larger samples involving multiple sites, including measures of both specific symptom effects as well as acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness in the real-world settings."

Approximately half of the individuals do not receive adequate treatment. Consequently, finding solutions to deliver cost-effective treatments for EDs has become a key goal of today's clinical psychology. Blended treatments, a combination of face-to-face and online interventions, have emerged as a potential solution to the previous. The Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of EDs (UP) might serve this purpose, as it can be applied to a variety of disorders simultaneously and its manualised format makes it suitable for blended interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a multicentre, randomised, superiority, clinical trial. Participants will be 310 individuals with a diagnosis of an ED. They will be randomised to a treatment as usual (individual cognitive behavioural therapy) or a UP condition in a blended format (face-to-face individual UP +online, app-based UP). Primary outcomes will be ED diagnostic criteria and depression and anxiety symptoms. Cost efficiency of the intervention, app usability, as well as opinion and confidence in the treatment will also be evaluated. Assessment points will include baseline and 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after UP treatment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approvals by the Ethics Research Committee of Navarra, Castellón, Euskadi, Castilla y León, Extremadura, Lleida and Aragón. The study is currently under an approval process by the Ethics Research Committees of all the remaining collaborating centres. Outcomes will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conference meetings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04304911."

While digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been shown to be clinically effective, the relationship between DMHI use and outcome is unclear. The current study sought to identify the factors affecting the relationship between DMHI use and depression and anxiety symptom improvement in sub-groups of young people. METHOD: An observational cohort design included young people aged 12-25 years engaging with a DMHI (MOST) from October 2020 to October 2023. The primary outcome was improvement at 12 weeks on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ4). DMHIs were combinations of self-paced digital cognitive-behavioural therapy content, social network interactions, and professional support. A machine learning clustering algorithm was used to identify distinct user clusters based on baseline characteristics and multiple logistic regression models examined the relationship between DMHI usage and improvement. RESULTS: Two distinct user clusters emerged, differing by symptom severity, age, service setting, and concurrent external treatment. 46.7% of ""Severe"" users and 39.8% of ""Mild-Moderate"" users significantly improved. Greater use of therapy content and professional support interactions were associated with improvement for the Mild-Moderate group only (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: While a greater proportion of users in the Severe group significantly improved, increased MOST use was associated with symptom improvement only for the Mild-Moderate group. These findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between DMHI use and outcome. Other unmeasured mediating or moderating factors such concurrent 'offline' treatment may help explain the results. Further research is required to better understand the relationship between DMHI use and clinical outcomes."

To address this, we introduced a digital stepped-care program rooted in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, aiming to alleviate mental health distress among the general public seeking help. Methods: The program comprises a 4-week digital application using ""Aury"" the chatbot, followed by an optional 6-week online group session for those still symptomatic. A 4-week waiting period separated these steps. Participants entered based on self-identified mental health concerns. Interventions addressed prevalent pandemic mental health issues: sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, worry/rumination, interpersonal issues, and resource mobilization. Outcomes focused on depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Results: Of the 1261 initial participants, postchatbot results (N = 142) indicated small to medium effects (d = 0.412 to d = 0.523). Those finishing the entire program (N = 41) saw substantial symptom decline with medium to large effects (d = 0.757 to d = 0.818). No shifts were seen in the waiting phase. At follow-up 6 months after baseline, both groups-those who only used the chatbot (N = 60; d = 0.284 to d = 0.416) and those who completed the entire program (N = 27; d = 0.854 to d = 0.926)-showed sustained symptom reduction. Comparing groups that received no intervention, used the chatbot only, and completed the entire program, we observed a dose-response effect. Conclusions: This resource-efficient and adaptable digital approach effectively reduced pandemic-induced mental health issues, indicating its potential in crisis periods with limited health resources. Randomized controlled trials are recommended for further validation. Trial Registration: Clinical Trial Registry identifier: DRKS00023220."

This review examined: (a) the effectiveness of digital interventions for psychological well-being at work, (b) associations with workplace outcomes, and (c) associations between interventions' effectiveness and their theory-base. METHODS: six electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies. The methodological quality of studies that used randomisation was conducted with the ""Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias"" tool, while the ""JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist"" was used for non-randomised studies. Studies' theory-base was evaluated using an adaptation of the ""theory coding scheme"" (TSC). Due to heterogeneity, narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: 51 studies were included in a synthesis describing four clusters of digital interventions: (a) cognitive behavioural therapy, (b) stress-management interventions and workplace well-being promotion, (c) meditation training and mindfulness-based interventions, and (d) self-help interventions. Studies demonstrated a high risk of contamination effects and high attrition bias. Theory-informed interventions demonstrated greater effectiveness. Cognitive behavioural therapy demonstrated the most robust evidence for reducing depression symptoms among healthy employees. With the exception of the Headspace application, there was weak evidence for meditation training apps, while relaxation training was a key component of effective stress-management interventions."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of nonpharmacological interventions that prevents or treats anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among civilians recovering from physical traumatic injury. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar for articles since inception to December 28, 2023. We performed English-language RCTs of patients 18 years or older who sustained a physical injury and were assessed for symptoms of PTSD, depression, or anxiety within 1 year of injury. Dual reviewers performed screening for advancement to full-text review, data extraction, and final eligibility for systematic review and meta-analysis, and conflicts were resolved by the senior author. Meta-analysis used random effects. The primary outcome was standardized mean difference (SMD) between intervention and comparator groups. RESULTS: We identified 3,001 articles for title and abstract review. Overall, nonpharmacological interventions significantly prevented or treated PTSD (pooled SMD, -0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.06 to -0.36), depression (pooled SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.17), and anxiety (pooled SMD, -0.69; 95% CI, -1.01 to -0.37). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was associated with decreased symptoms of PTSD (pooled SMD, -1.10; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.66), depression (pooled SMD, -0.87; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.52), and anxiety. Non-CBT significantly reduced anxiety (pooled SMD, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.07). Collaborative care, non-CBT, and digital treatments failed to reach significance for PTSD and depression. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs suggest efficacy of CBT for PTSD, depression, and anxiety and non-CBT for anxiety, after physical trauma.

Beneficial treatment effects of face-to-face therapies, for example, grief counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy against complicated grief, have been reported. Evaluations of internet- and mobile-based interventions targeting symptoms of grief in bereaved individuals with regard to objective quality criteria are currently lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness and feasibility of internet- and mobile-based interventions against symptoms of grief after bereavement. METHODS: We conducted systematic literature searches of randomized controlled trials or feasibility studies published before January 9, 2020, following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations system. We further assessed aspects of feasibility and rated quality of interventions using criteria suggested by an expert panel on mental health care (German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics). A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to assess between-group effect sizes. RESULTS: In total, 9 trials (N=1349) were included. Of these, 7 studies were analyzed meta-analytically. Significant effects were found for symptoms of grief (g=0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.77), depression (g=0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.68), and posttraumatic stress (g=0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.01). Heterogeneity was moderate for grief and depression (I2=48.75% and 55.19%, respectively) and low for posttraumatic stress symptoms (I2=0%). The overall quality of evidence was graded low (grief and depression) to moderate (posttraumatic stress). User satisfaction with the interventions was high, as was the quality of the interventions assessed using objective quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Internet- or mobile-based interventions might constitute an effective treatment approach against symptoms of grief in bereaved adults. However, the small sample sizes and limited number of studies included in the review warrant further investigation.

Mobile-based therapy chatbots are increasingly being used to help young adults who suffer from depression. However, previous trials have short follow-up periods. Evidence of effectiveness in pragmatic conditions are still in lack. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which is a widely accepted and proven-useful self-help psychological intervention. The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effectiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression. METHODS: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were also collected. RESULTS: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students (n = 31), postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F = 5.37; P = 0.02). Follow-up analysis of completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01). User feedback showed that process factors were more influential than the content factors. CONCLUSIONS: The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with participants."

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the mental health chatbot in alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety among adolescents and young adults. METHODS: A systematic review framework was employed with a protocol pre-registered on Prospero (CRD42023418877). Databases were systematically searched, including PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Embase, Cochrane and IEEE. Data synthesis was conducted narratively, and meta-analysis was performed by pooling data from the original studies. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials focused on an acute population, mainly females and university students. Chatbots designed for daily conversations and mood monitoring, using cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, showed efficacy in treating depression (95% CI = -1.09 to -0.23; p = .003). However, it is essential to highlight that these interventions utilizing chatbots for mental health were not found to be efficacious in managing symptoms of anxiety (95% CI = -0.56 to 0.4; p = .74). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the effectiveness of mental health chatbots in treating depression, but further exploration and refinement are needed to optimize their efficacy in managing anxiety."
10.1016/j.invent.2017.08.001,Increasing engagement with an occupational digital stress management program through the use of an online facilitated discussion group: Results of a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Carolan S, Harris PR, Greenwood K, Cavanagh K.",Internet Interv,2017,2018.8.24,,,"INTRODUCTION: Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety are high, resulting in reduced work performance and absenteeism. There is evidence that digital mental health interventions delivered in the workplace are an effective way of treating these conditions, but intervention engagement and adherence remain a challenge. Providing guidance can lead to greater engagement and adherence; an online facilitated discussion group may be one way of providing that guidance in a time efficient way. This study compares engagement with a minimally guided digital mental health program (WorkGuru) delivered in the workplace with a discussion group (DG) and without a discussion group (MSG), and with a wait list control (WLC); it was conducted as a pilot phase of a definitive trial. METHODS: Eighty four individuals with elevated levels of stress from six organisations were recruited to the study and randomised to one of two active conditions (DG or MSG) or a WLC. The program WorkGuru is a CBT based, eight-week stress management intervention that is delivered with minimal guidance from a coach. Data was collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 16-week follow-up via online questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was number of logins. Secondary measures included further engagement measures, and measures of depression, anxiety, stress, comfort and enthusiasm. Quality measures including satisfaction and system usability were also collected. RESULTS: A greater number of logins was observed for the DG compared with the MSG; this was a medium between group effect size (d = 0.51; 95% CI: - 0.04, 1.05). Small to medium effect size differences were found at T2 in favour of the active conditions compared with the control on the DASS subscales depression, anxiety and stress, and the IWP subscales enthusiasm and comfort. This was largely maintained at T3. Satisfaction with the intervention was high with individuals in the MSG reporting greater satisfaction than individuals in the DG. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that access to an online facilitated discussion group increases engagement with a minimally supported occupational digital mental health intervention (as defined by the number of logins), but that this doesn't necessarily result in improved psychological outcomes or increased satisfaction when compared to access to the intervention without the group. Access to the web-based program was associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress and an increase in comfort and enthusiasm post intervention; these changes were largely maintained at follow-up.

Despite substantial investment in services, persistent barriers such as provider shortages, stigma, and accessibility issues continue to limit effective care delivery. This narrative review examines the emerging application of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in pediatric mental health contexts, mapping the current evidence base, identifying therapeutic mechanisms, and exploring unique developmental considerations required for implementation. METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus) for literature published between January 2010 and February 2025 that addressed conversational AI applications relevant to pediatric mental health. We employed a narrative synthesis approach with thematic analysis to organize findings across technological approaches, therapeutic applications, developmental considerations, implementation contexts, and ethical frameworks. RESULTS: The review identified promising applications for conversational AI in pediatric mental health, particularly for common conditions like anxiety and depression, psychoeducation, skills practice, and bridging to traditional care. However, most robust empirical research has focused on adult populations, with pediatric applications only beginning to receive dedicated investigation. Key therapeutic mechanisms identified include reduced barriers to self-disclosure, cognitive change, emotional validation, and behavioral activation. Developmental considerations emerged as fundamental challenges, necessitating age-appropriate adaptations across cognitive, emotional, linguistic, and ethical dimensions rather than simple modifications of adult-oriented systems. CONCLUSIONS: Conversational AI has potential to address significant unmet needs in pediatric mental health as a complement to, rather than replacement for, human-delivered care. Future research should prioritize developmental validation, longitudinal outcomes, implementation science, safety monitoring, and equity-focused design. Interdisciplinary collaboration involving children and families is essential to ensure these technologies effectively address the unique mental health needs of young people while mitigating potential risks."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize and assess the certainty of evidence of interventions proposed to decrease digital addiction from published meta-analyses. METHODS: An umbrella review of published meta-analyses was performed. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase for meta-analyses published up to February 2024. Eligible studies evaluated interventions using randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, or quasi-experimental studies and were assessed for methodological quality using Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews version 2. A random effects model was used to analyze data, considering heterogeneity and publication bias. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations was applied to assess evidence with certainty. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies assessing 21 associations were included in the umbrella review, of which 4 (80%) were high-quality meta-analyses. Weak evidence was observed in 19 associations, whereas null associations appeared in the remaining 2 associations. These associations pertained to 8 interventions (group counseling, integrated internet addiction [IA] prevention programs, psychosocial interventions, reality therapy, self-control training programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, interventions to reduce screen time in children, and exercise) and 9 outcomes (self-control, self-esteem, internet gaming disorder symptoms, time spent gaming, IA scores, screen use time, interpersonal sensitivity longlines, anxiety, and depression). Cognitive behavioral therapy reduces anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.939, 95% CI 0.311 to 1.586), internet gaming disorder symptoms (SMD 1.394, 95% CI 0.664 to 2.214), time spent gaming (SMD 1.259, 95% CI, 0.311 to 2.206), and IA scores (SMD -2.097, 95% CI -2.814 to -1.381). Group counseling had a large effect on improving self-control (SMD 1.296, 95% CI 0.269 to 2.322) and reducing IA levels (SMD -1.417, 95% CI -1.836 to -0.997). Exercise intervention reduced IA scores (SMD -2.322, 95% CI -3.212 to -1.431), depression scores (SMD -1.421, 95% CI -2.046 to -797), and interpersonal sensitivity scores (SMD -1.433, 95% CI -2.239 to -0.627). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence indicates that current interventions to reduce digital addiction are weak. Data from more and better-designed studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish robust evidence.

A meta-analysis of 154 randomized controlled trials (RCTs),"Zainal NH, Soh CP, Van Doren N, Benjet C.",Clin Psychol Rev,2024,2024.11.23,,,"Although the short-term efficacy of internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (i-CBT) is well-established, its long-term efficacy remains understudied. Robust variance estimation meta-analysis was thus conducted across guided and self-guided i-CBT, synthesizing data from 154 randomized controlled trials (N = 45,335) with ≥ 12-month follow-ups. For binary outcomes, guided (52.3% vs. 38.6%; log-risk ratio [LOG-RR] = 1.15 95% confidence interval [1.04, 1.26]) yielded higher remission, reliable improvement, and response rates, and lower suboptimal treatment outcome rates (9.3% vs. 10.8%; LOG-RR = 0.63 [0.45, 0.80]) than treatment-as-usual, active controls, and waitlists at ≥12 months. Insufficient studies precluded testing the efficacy between self-guided i-CBT and controls for binary outcomes. For baseline-to-12-month dimensional outcomes, guided i-CBT produced greater reductions in anxiety, depressive, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and repetitive negative thinking (Hedge's g = -1.86 to -0.31), and self-guided i-CBT yielded stronger reductions in depressive symptoms (g = -0.51) than all controls. For outcome scores aggregated at ≥ 12-month follow-ups, guided i-CBT alleviated anxiety, depression, distress, insomnia, PTSD symptoms, role impairment, emotion regulation, and quality of life (g = -0.31 to 0.26), and self-guided i-CBT yielded lower anxiety and depressive symptoms (g = -0.16 to -0.09) than all controls. No significant differences in efficacy emerged between guided and self-guided i-CBT when sufficient studies existed for a meta-analysis. There was no evidence for publication bias. Long-term efficacy was similar to short-term efficacy for most outcomes. Implementing scalable i-CBTs should entail transparency about their long-term benefits and drawbacks."

Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI) is the standard of care for the treatment of insomnia recommended by the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the American College of Physicians. CBTI is highly effective but has limited scalability. It is often unavailable in clinical settings where service members receive sleep care. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to scale and broaden the geographic reach of CBTI services and support increased patient access and engagement in behavioral sleep care. This study aims to evaluate the impact and acceptability of digital CBTI hubs to augment military treatment facilities' capabilities in behavioral sleep medicine. METHODS: This is a multi-site, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of in-person (face-to-face or virtual) insomnia care as usual at three military sleep clinics versus CBTI delivered remotely and asynchronously through digital CBTI hubs. Digital CBTI hubs are led by licensed, certified clinicians who use NOCTEM's® evidence-based clinical decision support platform COAST™ (Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology). Changes in insomnia severity and daytime symptoms of depression and anxiety will be compared at baseline, at 6-8 weeks, and at 3-month follow-up. Patient satisfaction with insomnia care as usual versus digital CBTI hubs will also be examined. We hypothesize that digital CBTI hubs will be non-inferior to insomnia care as usual for improvements in insomnia and daytime symptoms as well as patient satisfaction with insomnia care. DISCUSSION: Digital technology has a high potential to scale CBTI accessibility and delivery options required to meet the insomnia care needs of military service members. Digital CBTI hubs using COAST offer a novel approach to broaden service members' access to CBTI and to serve as an augmentation strategy for existing sleep services at military treatment facilities. The pragmatic approach leveraging technology in this trial has the potential to rapidly inform clinical practice within the Defense Health Agency as well as other healthcare systems.

Individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, sexual and gender minority groups, and those with low income are all at heightened risk for prenatal anxiety due to disproportionate exposure to adverse social determinants of health. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) has been shown to reliably reduce anxiety in mostly White and middle- to higher-income samples, but its efficacy in low-income and marginalized pregnant people is understudied. OBJECTIVE: We propose a randomized controlled trial of a dCBT (Daylight app, Big Health, Ltd) in a sample of low-income pregnant people oversampled for racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority identity. METHODS: Participants (N=132) will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist control group using a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will be a self-guided application that uses an online therapist to teach and encourage the practice of 4 key cognitive behavioral therapy skills (eg, identifying catastrophic thinking and increasing physical relaxation) that can reduce anxiety. The primary outcome will be generalized anxiety symptoms; secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, stress, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and insomnia symptoms. Focus groups with a subset of participants will provide qualitative data about the acceptability of dCBT. RESULTS: Recruitment began in June 2024. Data will be analyzed using linear mixed models, which will be fit with treatment condition (dCBT and waitlist control group) as the between-group factor, time (baseline, 3, 6, and 10 weeks post randomization) as a within-group factor, and a group-by-time interaction. Linear mixed models produce unbiased parameter estimates in situations where there are different numbers of observations per record and will accommodate intent-to-treat and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of a self-guided dCBT for prenatal anxiety among low-income and marginalized pregnant people, a group that continues to experience substantial barriers to accessing in-person evidence-based psychotherapy.

One increasingly popular approach of improving access to care is the use of web-based intervention programs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was 2-fold: first, to assess the efficacy of Be a Mom, a brief web-based selective or indicated preventive intervention, in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms of women at high risk for PPD; and second, to examine mechanisms of change linking modifiable self-regulatory skills (ie, emotion regulation, self-compassion, and psychological flexibility) to improved perinatal mental health outcomes. METHODS: This 2-arm, open-label randomized controlled trial involved a sample of 1053 perinatal women presenting high risk for PPD who were allocated to the Be a Mom intervention group or a waitlist control group and completed self-report measures at baseline and postintervention assessments. Univariate latent change score models were computed to determine changes over time in adjustment processes and outcomes, with a multigroup-model approach to detect differences between the intervention and control groups and a 2-wave latent change score model to examine whether changes in processes were related to changes in outcomes. RESULTS: Be a Mom was found to be effective in reducing depressive (intervention group: µΔ=-3.35; P<.001 vs control group: µΔ=-1.48; P<.001) and anxiety symptoms (intervention group: µΔ=-2.24; P<.001 vs control group: µΔ=-0.43; P=.04) in comparison with the control group, where such changes were inexistent or much smaller. All 3 psychological processes under study improved statistically significantly in posttreatment assessments: emotion regulation ability (Δχ23=12.3; P=.007) and psychological flexibility (Δχ23=34.9; P<.001) improved only in the intervention group, and although self-compassion increased in both groups (Δχ23=65.6; P<.001), these improvements were considerably greater in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Be a Mom, a low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy program, is a promising first-line intervention for helping perinatal women, particularly those with early-onset PPD symptoms.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 80% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014 in Europe occurred in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Romania has particularly high HIV incidence, AIDS prevalence, and AIDS-related deaths. HIV incidence today in Romania is largely attributed to sexual contact among gay and bisexual men (GBM). However, homophobic stigma in Romania keeps GBM out of reach of the scant available prevention services and serves as a risk factor for HIV. The Comunică intervention delivers motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy skills across eight live text-based counseling sessions. Preliminary evidence suggests that Comunică possesses promise for reducing GBM's co-occurring mental (e.g., depression), behavioral (e.g., heavy alcohol use), and sexual (e.g., HIV-transmission-risk behavior) health risks in Romania and perhaps other similar high-stigma national contexts. This paper describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of Comunică. METHODS: To test Comunică's efficacy, 305 GBM were randomized to receive Comunică or a content-matched education attention control condition. The control condition consists of eight time-matched educational modules that present information regarding GBM identity development, information about HIV transmission and prevention, the importance of HIV/STI testing and treatment, heavy alcohol use and its associations with HIV-transmission-risk behavior, sexual health communication, finding social support, and creating sexual health goals. Outcomes are measured pre-intervention (baseline), and at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome is frequency of condomless anal sex acts with HIV-positive or unknown-status partners outside of the context of one's own adherent PrEP use or primary partner's adherent PrEP use or undetectable viral load in the past 30 days at each follow-up. Secondary outcomes include depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, heavy alcohol use, and HIV/STI testing; motivational and stigma-related mechanisms of intervention efficacy will also be examined. DISCUSSION: If found to be efficacious, Comunică presents a scalable platform to provide mental, behavioral, and sexual health support to GBM living in Romania and similar high-stigma, low-resource areas within the CEE region and beyond.

10.2196/25847,Evidence on Digital Mental Health Interventions for Adolescents and Young People: Systematic Overview,"Lehtimaki S, Martic J, Wahl B, Foster KT, Schwalbe N.",JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021.4.29,,,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 1 in 5 adolescents experience a mental health disorder each year; yet because of barriers to accessing and seeking care, most remain undiagnosed and untreated. Furthermore, the early emergence of psychopathology contributes to a lifelong course of challenges across a broad set of functional domains, so addressing this early in the life course is essential. With increasing digital connectivity, including in low- and middle-income countries, digital health technologies are considered promising for addressing mental health among adolescents and young people. In recent years, a growing number of digital health interventions, including more than 2 million web-based mental health apps, have been developed to address a range of mental health issues. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on digital health interventions targeting adolescents and young people with mental health conditions, aged between 10-24 years, with a focus on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability to low-resource settings (eg, low- and middle-income countries). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases between January 2010 and June 2020 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting adolescents and young people aged between 10-24 years. Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews. RESULTS: In this systematic overview, we included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We found evidence on the effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety and depression, whereas the effectiveness of other digital mental health interventions remains inconclusive. Interventions with an in-person element with a professional, peer, or parent were associated with greater effectiveness, adherence, and lower dropout than fully automatized or self-administered interventions. Despite the proposed utility of digital interventions for increasing accessibility of treatment across settings, no study has reported sample-specific metrics of social context (eg, socioeconomic background) or focused on low-resource settings. CONCLUSIONS: Although digital interventions for mental health can be effective for both supplementing and supplanting traditional mental health treatment, only a small proportion of existing digital platforms are evidence based. Furthermore, their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness, including in low- and middle-income countries, have been understudied. Widespread adoption and scale-up of digital mental health interventions, especially in settings with limited resources for health, will require more rigorous and consistent demonstrations of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vis-à-vis the type of service provided, target population, and the current standard of care."

The delivery of internet-based CBT (iCBT) has been established as a result of both technological improvements that have influenced health promotion and prevention components, and limited social contact and health service access. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the best available evidence concerning the preventive effect of iCBT on employees. METHODS: A systematic search will be conducted across 12 electronic databases, including a hand search for main journals and reference lists. Randomized controlled trials testing the effects of iCBT on psychological outcomes and work engagement among employees will be eligible. Initial keywords will cover the concepts of employees, workers, non-health care personnel, internet-based, web-based, eHealth cognitive behavioral interventions, stress, depression, anxiety, and work engagement, and then a full search strategy will be developed. Following titles, abstracts and the full text will be screened for assessment against the inclusion criteria for the review. Search results will be fully reported and presented per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent reviewers will screen and extract data, appraise methodological quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool, and assess overall quality of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. A random effects meta-analysis and standardized mean differences using review manager software will be applied to synthesize the effect of iCBT based on similar outcomes. RESULTS: This protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews in March 2022 and is now an ongoing process. The data will be analyzed in August 2022, and the review process should be completed by December 2022. All included studies will be synthesized and presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of iCBT in decreasing psychological distress and optimizing work engagement outcomes among employees. CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings of this study, iCBT therapies will be used to promote mental health concerns such as depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress, stress, insomnia, and resilience among non-health care professionals. In addition, the results will be used to ensure the policy related to reducing psychological distress and optimizing work engagement in the workplace.

This study evaluated the impact of combining CBT with a web-based program versus CBT alone on psychological outcomes in college students with maladaptive perfectionism. METHODS: This study involved 52 participants randomized to a 10-week intervention of either CBT or CBT combined with a web-based application. Outcomes assessed included perfectionism, depression, anxiety, stress, psychological well-being, procrastination, and life satisfaction, measured through self-reporting at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 follow-ups. Data analyses utilized independent t tests, chi-square tests for preintervention differences, and repeated mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate intervention effects over time, with effect sizes calculated using η². RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 27.85 years (SD, 4.94), were predominantly female (n = 34; 74%), mostly single (n = 29; 73.9%), and held a master's degree (n = 20; 43.5%). Overall, 52 participants were randomized into 2 groups, with 26 participants in each group. Of these, 23 participants from each group completed the treatment and follow-up periods. The CBT combined with an App group demonstrated superior effectiveness in addressing perfectionism and improving interpersonal sensitivity, striving for excellence, and high standards for others compared with CBT alone. In addition, this combined treatment was significantly better than CBT in reducing stress, increasing psychological well-being, and improving life satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Integrating a web-based self-help application with CBT effectively reduces maladaptive perfectionism and associated psychopathology, highlighting the potential benefits of combining digital tools with traditional therapeutic approaches."

However, scaling this proven effective intervention to areas of high need remains a challenge, necessitating sensitive adaptation and evaluation. METHODS: A randomised waitlist-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a hybrid digital CBT-I and emotion regulation (dCBT-I + ER) intervention delivered through workplaces. Participants with at least mild insomnia and depression or anxiety symptoms were randomised to the intervention or waitlist control groups. The intervention was delivered via a web-based platform and four video-conferencing therapy sessions. Participants tracked their sleep using actigraphy and a sleep diary that was used to pace the intervention delivered. Assessments occurred at baseline and 8 weeks post-randomisation, measuring insomnia, depression, anxiety, psychological well-being, quality of life, and work productivity. RESULTS: Of the 159 participants (mean age 43.6 ± 9.4 years, 76.7% female, 80.5% white), 80 received the intervention and 79 were in the control group. The intervention group showed significant improvements in insomnia (F1, 134 = 71.46, p < .0001); depression (F1, 134 = 35.67, p < .0001); and anxiety (F1, 134 = 17.63, p < .0001), with large effect sizes (d = 0.7-1.5). Sleep diary data supported these findings, whereas actigraphy data did not. Improvements in psychological well-being were significant (F1, 132.13 = 10.64, p < 0.001), whereas quality of life, work productivity, and satisfaction outcomes were not. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a hybrid dCBT-I + ER intervention, delivered via workplaces, effectively improves insomnia, depression, and anxiety. It holds promise as a scalable solution, warranting further investigation into its long-term efficacy and economic impact."

The Government of Ontario initiated access to two internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs, LifeWorks AbilitiCBT and MindBeacon TAiCBT, for adults with mental health issues. METHODS: An uncontrolled observational study utilizing secondary retrospective program data was conducted to evaluate the reach, uptake, and psychological symptom changes among participants engaging with either iCBT program. RESULTS: Between May 2020 and September 2021, 56,769 individuals enrolled in LifeWorks AbilitiCBT, and 73,356 in MindBeacon TAiCBT. However, substantial exclusions were made: 56% of LifeWorks participants and 68% of MindBeacon participants were ineligible or failed to initiate treatment. Consequently, 25,154 LifeWorks participants and 23,795 MindBeacon participants were included in the analysis. Of these, 22% of LifeWorks and 26% of MindBeacon participants completed over 75% of iCBT treatment. On average, LifeWorks participants received 13 ± SD 7.1 therapist messages and sent 5 ± SD 10.3 messages, while MindBeacon participants received 25 ± SD 20.7 therapist messages and sent 13 ± SD 16.4 messages. LifeWorks included synchronous therapist contact averaging 1.4 ± SD 1.9 h per participant, while MindBeacon was purely asynchronous. Baseline severity of anxiety (37%) and depression symptoms (22%) was higher for LifeWorks participants compared to MindBeacon participants (24% and 10%, respectively). Clinically significant changes in anxiety and depression scores were observed: 22% of LifeWorks and 31% of MindBeacon participants exhibited reliable recovery in PHQ-9 scores, while 26% of LifeWorks and 25% of MindBeacon participants demonstrated reliable recovery in GAD-7 scores. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, iCBT programs show promise for engaged participants with varying levels of severity in anxiety and depression symptoms. Future iterations of iCBT should consider adopting a broad entry criterion to iCBT programming to increase accessibility, especially for those with severe symptoms, alongside integrated intake care pathways, and potential payment structure adjustments for iCBT service providers. Taken all together, these factors could temper high dropout rates post-intake assessment. This evaluation underscores the potential and value of digital mental health interventions for individuals with mild to severe anxiety or depression symptoms, emphasizing the importance of addressing participant dropout."

METHOD: Thirty-one women participated in 12 weekly group CBT sessions and a 12 week follow-up. Participants submitted a text message nightly indicating the number of binge eating and purging episodes and rating their urges to binge and purge. Automatic feedback messages were tailored to their self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Fully 87% of participants adhered to self-monitoring and reported good acceptability. The number of binge eating and purging episodes as well as symptoms of depression (BDI), eating disorder (EDI), and night eating (NES) decreased significantly from baseline to both post-treatment and follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the frequent use of mobile phones and text-messaging globally, this proof-of-principle study suggests their use may enhance self-monitoring and treatment for BN leading to improved attendance, adherence, engagement in treatment, and remission from the disorder."

In June 2021, the provincial government in Ontario provided free access to Breaking Free Online (BFO), a digital behavioral change program for people with substance use disorders. METHODS: An observational study was conducted with retrospective data to characterize clients' use and engagement patterns in BFO and examine changes in self-reported outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 6,370 individuals registered for BFO between June 2021 and October 2022, of whom 3,650 completed the intake assessment. Most of these clients were self-referred (64%), with 37% having been referred by health service providers. More than one-half of the clients (52%) resided in Ontario West or East regions. Support for addressing problematic alcohol use was the most requested program (40%). By October 2022, about 44% of the clients had completed between one and four of 12 program strategies. Analysis revealed significant changes in pre-post scores across four validated scales (p<0.001), indicating a decrease in anxiety and depression, an increase in quality of life, an improvement in recovery progression, and a decrease in severity of symptoms associated with substance use disorders. CONCLUSIONS: BFO clients with higher completion rates had the most improvement across the scales used; however, clients with lower and medium completion rates also had improvements. Because of the shame and stigma associated with substance use, digital supports with low barriers to entry can help support the autonomy, privacy, and preferences of individuals seeking help for problematic substance use."

Digital interventions provide low cost and easily scalable delivery methods to implement psychological interventions in the workplace. This trial tests the feasibility of implementing a self-guided 8-week digital cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for subthreshold to clinical depression and/or anxiety versus waitlist control (ie, life as usual) in the workplace. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Feasibility of implementation will be tested using a mixed-methods evaluation of the two-arm randomised waitlist-control trial. Evaluation will include examination of organisational buy-in, and the engagement of employees through the trial indicated by the completion of outcome measures. In addition, we also explore how participants use the platform, the appropriateness of the analysis both with reference to the outcome measures and linear modelling. Finally, we examine the acceptability of the intervention based on participants experiences using qualitative interviews. Assessments take place at baseline (T0), at 8 weeks post-treatment (T1), at short-term follow-up 4 weeks post-treatment (T2) and long-term follow-ups (6 and 12 months after-end of treatment).

Such co-occurring conditions (""comorbidity"") have negative prognostic implications for AUD treatment outcomes, yet they commonly go unaddressed in standard AUD care. Over a decade ago, we developed and validated a cognitive behavioral therapy intervention to supplement standard AUD care that, when delivered by trained therapists, improves outcomes in comorbid patients. However, this validated intervention, like many others in addiction care, has not been taken up in community-based AUD treatment programs. This phenomenon-empirically validated treatments that fail to be widely adopted in community care-has been termed the ""research-to-practice gap."" Researchers have suggested that the availability of fully autonomous digital equivalents of validated therapist-delivered therapies could reduce some barriers underlying the research-to-practice gap, especially by eliminating the need for costly and intensive therapist training and supervision. OBJECTIVE: With this in mind, we obtained a Program Development Grant (R34) to conduct formative work in the development of a fully autonomous digital version of our previously validated therapist-delivered intervention for AUD treatment patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder. METHODS: In the first phase of the project, we developed the digital intervention. This process included: (1) identifying appropriate collaborators and vendors; (2) consultation with an e-learning expert to develop a storyboard and accompanying graphics and narrative; (3) video production and editing; and (4) interactive programming. The second phase of the project was functional testing of the newly developed digital intervention conducted in 52 residential AUD treatment patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder. Patients underwent the 3 one-hour segments of the newly developed intervention and completed user surveys, knowledge quizzes, and behavioral competence tests. RESULTS: While the development of the digital intervention was successful, the timeline was approximately double that projected (1 vs 2 years) due to false starts and inefficiencies that we describe, including lessons learned. Functional testing of the newly developed digital intervention showed that, on average, patients rated the user experience in the upper (favorable) 20% of the response scales. Knowledge quizzes and behavioral demonstrations showed that over 80% of participants gained functional mastery of the key skills and information taught in the program. CONCLUSIONS: Functional testing results in this study justify a randomized controlled trial of the digital intervention's efficacy, which is currently ongoing. In sharing the details of our challenges and solutions in developing the digital intervention, we hope to inform others developing digital tools. The extent to which the availability of empirically validated, fully autonomous digital interventions achieves their potential to reduce the research-to-practice gap remains an open but important empirical question. The present work stands as a necessary first step toward that end."

DESIGN: Living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2023. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Trials that randomised adults (≥18 years) with long covid to drug or non-drug interventions, placebo or sham, or usual care. RESULTS: 24 trials with 3695 patients were eligible. Four trials (n=708 patients) investigated drug interventions, eight (n=985) physical activity or rehabilitation, three (n=314) behavioural, four (n=794) dietary, four (n=309) medical devices and technologies, and one (n=585) a combination of physical exercise and mental health rehabilitation. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) probably reduces fatigue (mean difference -8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.11 to -3.69; Checklist for Individual Strength fatigue subscale; range 8-56, higher scores indicate greater impairment) and probably improves concentration (mean difference -5.2, -7.97 to -2.43; Checklist for Individual Strength concentration problems subscale; range 4-28; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online, supervised, combined physical and mental health rehabilitation programme probably leads to improvement in overall health, with an estimated 161 more patients per 1000 (95% CI 61 more to 292 more) experiencing meaningful improvement or recovery, probably reduces symptoms of depression (mean difference -1.50, -2.41 to -0.59; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale; range 0-21; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and probably improves quality of life (0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29+2 Profile; range -0.022-1; higher scores indicate less impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that intermittent aerobic exercise 3-5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks probably improves physical function compared with continuous exercise (mean difference 3.8, 1.12 to 6.48; SF-36 physical component summary score; range 0-100; higher scores indicate less impairment). No compelling evidence was found to support the effectiveness of other interventions, including, among others, vortioxetine, leronlimab, combined probiotics-prebiotics, coenzyme Q10, amygdala and insula retraining, combined L-arginine and vitamin C, inspiratory muscle training, transcranial direct current stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen, a mobile application providing education on long covid.

10.1038/s41746-017-0010-4,Delivering digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia at scale: does using a wearable device to estimate sleep influence therapy?,"Luik AI, Farias Machado P, Espie CA.",NPJ Digit Med,2018,2019.7.16,,,"Contemporary developments, such as digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and wearable devices estimating sleep, could support the implementation of CBT for insomnia at a large scale. We assessed what characterizes those users who connected a wearable device to the program to estimate sleep diary variables, and whether connecting a wearable device affected insomnia symptom improvement, related well-being, and program interaction. In total, 3551 users (63% female, mean age 44.50 ± 14.78 years) of a dCBT program who completed a post-therapy survey, including 378 users (10.6%) who used a device, were selected. Within-subject, pre-therapy to post-therapy, the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI, 7 Items) was used to assess insomnia. Two-item measures (depression, anxiety) and single item measures (perceived stress, life satisfaction, work productivity) of well-being were analyzed, in addition to program interaction. For all participants, insomnia symptoms significantly improved following dCBT (t(3504) = 83.33, p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.45), as did depression and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, life satisfaction and work productivity. Those who did not connect a device reported better sleep and less affected work productivity (all p < .001) than those who did connect a device at baseline and post-treatment; nevertheless treatment effects were largely similar for the two groups. Those who connected a device interacted more with additional program components. In conclusion, improvements in insomnia after completing dCBT are similar in persons choosing to wear a wearable device to estimate sleep and persons completing a subjective sleep diary. Potentially, use of wearable devices can facilitate treatment for those who struggle to complete daily diaries."
10.1093/sleep/zsac251,Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia prevents and alleviates suicidal ideation: insomnia remission is a suicidolytic mechanism,"Kalmbach DA, Cheng P, Ahmedani BK, Peterson EL, Reffi AN, Sagong C, Seymour GM, Ruprich MK, Drake CL.",Sleep,2022,2022.10.15,,,"Comment in Sleep. 2022 Dec 12;45(12):zsac260. doi: 10.1093/sleep/zsac260. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is associated with elevated levels of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) may reduce suicidal ideation (SI). However, the role of digital therapeutics in both the alleviation and prevention of SI remains unclear, and treatment mechanisms facilitating SI reductions have not been clearly identified. METHODS: A total of 658 adults with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition insomnia disorder enrolled in a single-site randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of digital CBTI relative to attention control. Outcomes were measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Before treatment, 126 patients endorsed SI (19.1% prevalence). Among those with baseline SI, CBTI patients reported lower SI rates at posttreatment (30.0% vs 54.5%, p = .005) and 1-year follow-up (29.6% vs 46.8%, p = .042) relative to control. PRODCLIN analysis estimated that half of suicidolytic effects of CBTI were mediated through insomnia remission. Among those without baseline SI, CBTI did not directly prevent new onset SI. However, insomnia remitters reported lower rates of new-onset SI at posttreatment relative to non-remitters (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = .009). Mediation analysis supported a significant indirect effect wherein CBTI increased the likelihood of insomnia remission, which was associated with SI prevention (αβ = -3.20, 95% CI = -5.74 to -0.87). CONCLUSION: Digital CBTI reduces insomnia symptoms, which promotes SI alleviation and prevention. For nonsuicidal patients, digital CBTI may serve as a highly accessible monotherapy for improving sleep, thereby reducing the risk for SI. For suicidal patients, digital CBTI may be appropriately administered as an adjunct treatment to support mainline intervention more directly targeting suicidogenic thoughts."
10.2196/41890,Internet-Delivered Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Training for Chronic Pain: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Norman-Nott N, Hesam-Shariati N, Wilks CR, Schroeder J, Suh J, Briggs NE, McAuley JH, Quidé Y, Gustin SM.",JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023.6.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Emotion dysregulation is key to the development and maintenance of chronic pain, feeding into a cycle of worsening pain and disability. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment for complex transdiagnostic conditions presenting with high emotion dysregulation, may be beneficial to manage and mitigate the emotional and sensory aspects of chronic pain. Increasingly, DBT skills training as a key component of standard DBT is being delivered as a stand-alone intervention without concurrent therapy to help develop skills for effective emotion regulation. A previous repeated-measure single-case trial investigating a novel technologically driven DBT skills training, internet-delivered DBT skills training for chronic pain (iDBT-Pain), revealed promising findings to improve both emotion dysregulation and pain intensity. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of iDBT-Pain in comparison with treatment as usual to reduce emotion dysregulation (primary outcome) for individuals with chronic pain after 9 weeks and at the 21-week follow-up. The secondary outcomes include pain intensity, pain interference, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, harm avoidance, social cognition, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and well-being. The trial also examines the acceptability of the iDBT-Pain intervention for future development and testing. METHODS: A total of 48 people with chronic pain will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: treatment and treatment as usual. Participants in the treatment condition will receive iDBT-Pain, consisting of 6 live web-based group sessions led by a DBT skills trainer and supervised by a registered psychologist and the iDBT-Pain app. Participants in the treatment-as-usual condition will not receive iDBT-Pain but will still access their usual medication and health interventions. We predict that iDBT-Pain will improve the primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and the secondary outcomes of pain intensity, pain interference, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, harm avoidance, social cognition, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and well-being. A linear mixed model with random effects of individuals will be conducted to investigate the differences between the baseline, 9-week (primary end point), and 21-week (follow-up) assessments as a function of experimental condition. RESULTS: Recruitment started in February 2023, and the clinical trial started in March 2023. Data collection for the final assessment is planned to be completed by July 2024. CONCLUSIONS: If our hypothesis is confirmed, our findings will contribute to the evidence for the efficacy and acceptability of a viable intervention that may be used by health care professionals for people with chronic pain. The results will add to the chronic pain literature to inform about the potential benefits of DBT skills training for chronic pain and will contribute evidence about technologically driven interventions.

However, due to heavy workloads, they often miss the opportunity for self-care. Any effort to diminish this problem improves the quality of Healthcare providers and enhances patient safety. various applications have been developed to empower Healthcare providers and reduce their anxiety, but these applications do not meet all their individual and professional needs. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of mobile-based self-care applications on reducing anxiety in healthcare providers. METHODS: In this study, keywords such as anxiety, self-care, healthcare providers, and mobile health were used to search PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for papers published in the recent ten years (2014-2024). We used the PRISMA diagram to report the results. Ten out of 2515 retrieved articles that addressed the effect of mobile-based self-care applications on Healthcare providers' anxiety were included for analysis. Data were extracted using a data collection form designed based on the research objective. We used this form to collect data including the author's name, publication year, country, study type, intervention duration, study objectives, platform used, Modules presented in technologies, Methods of reducing anxiety, questionnaire details, and Effectiveness assessment. Data collected from the studies were analyzed by SPSS-21 using frequency and percentage. RESULTS: Based on the results, studies were conducted in nine different countries, and the intervention duration and strategies for reducing anxiety using self-care applications ranged from two weeks to four months. The impact of mobile health applications, their content, and intervention strategies on reducing anxiety were positive. The anxiety-reduction strategies were varied among applications. Anxiety reduction strategies in this study included mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical activities, breathing exercises, dietary regimes, and nature exploration through virtual reality. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness constituted the most frequently applied reduction techniques across the studies to reduce anxiety in Healthcare providers.Furthermore, the findings revealed the effectiveness of interventions in reducing other mental disorders such as anxiety, stress, depression, drug abuse, and psychotropic drug use of Healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: The use of mobile health applications with practical strategies is effective in reducing anxiety and can also reduce other anxiety disorders in Healthcare professional."
10.3389/fdgth.2021.689750,Responsible Relations: A Systematic Scoping Review of the Therapeutic Alliance in Text-Based Digital Psychotherapy,"van Lotringen CM, Jeken L, Westerhof GJ, Ten Klooster PM, Kelders SM, Noordzij ML.",Front Digit Health,2021,2021.10.29,,,"Introduction: Developing a good therapeutic alliance is considered essential for the responsible delivery of psychotherapy. Text-based digital psychotherapy has become increasingly common, yet much remains unclear about the alliance and its importance for delivering mental health care via a digital format. To employ text-based digital therapies responsibly, more insight is needed into the type and strength of the therapeutic alliance online. Methods: A systematic scoping review was performed searching four databases: Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library. A total of 23 studies were selected and data was extracted and tabulated to explore the characteristics of studies on text-based psychotherapy, measurements of the therapeutic alliance and associations of the alliance with treatment outcome. Results: The therapeutic alliance in text-based digital interventions was studied with a variety of client groups, though mostly for clients diagnosed with anxiety and/or depression issues. Treatment modalities were predominantly internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and tailored platforms for distinct client groups (e.g., PTSD). Almost all treatments used asynchronous text-based communication, such as e-mails and integrated messaging functions, which were mainly used to give feedback on tasks. For measurements, a version of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) was used in most studies. Measurements with the WAI or WAI- short form indicated a good therapeutic alliance with a weighted mean score of 5.66 (on a scale of 1 to 7) and a weighted standard deviation of 0.84. Relations between the therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes were mostly positive, with many studies reporting significant associations (n = 8 out of 10) or significant effects of the therapeutic alliance on treatment outcomes (n = 5 out of 6). Discussion: Our scoping review suggests that a good therapeutic alliance can be established in digital psychotherapy through text-based communication, and shows support for a positive relationship between the alliance and treatment outcomes. These findings illustrate that text-based online psychotherapy can be a responsible treatment option as far as the establishment of the therapeutic alliance is concerned. However, current measures of the therapeutic alliance might miss important aspects of the alliance in digital treatment, such as the presence of empathy or compassion."

However, not all patients achieve insomnia remission after treatment. We explored the factors influencing the effectiveness of D-CBT-I in a clinical practice. A total of 414 Asian chronic insomniacs were studied during a 6 week D-CBT-I intervention. All patients were assessed at baseline and posttreatment and were determined to be remitters or non-remitters, responders or non-responders by posttreatment criteria; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI <8) or ISI reduction ≥8, to examine whether remission and response status were associated with patient baseline characteristics. The average baseline ISI score in all subjects was 16.29 points. At posttreatment, 192 (46.4%) patients achieved ISI remission and 218 (52.7%) patients demonstrated an ISI response. An increased baseline early morning awakening time and ISI score were independently associated with a lower odds for remission (OR, 0.995 and 0.991, respectively). Increased baseline Patients Health Questionnaire-9 score was independently associated with higher odds for response (OR, 1.114). Our results suggest that D-CBT-I can be recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, particularly in insomniacs with milder insomnia symptoms and more severe depressive symptoms. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of D-CBT-I was adversely affected by longer early morning awakening time and higher insomnia severity at pretreatment, which may be improved by more intense intervention and greater therapeutic support or by traditional CBT-I."

BACKGROUND: The impact of cognitive behavioural therapy on perinatal depression has been evaluated in various studies, but there is uncertainty about their impact. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Nine electronic literature databases were searched to retrieve eligible randomised controlled trials: CNKI, VIP digital database, Chinese Wanfang database, the Cochrane library, PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL from the inception of the databases up to 15 November 2019. The eligible studies were screened and extracted, and then, the methodological quality was evaluated independently by two researchers. The meta-analyst software (Rev Man 5.3) was used to conduct the meta-analysis. Checklist of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses has been followed. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs with 966 participants were included. The results showed that the CBT group was superior to the usual care group in reducing depression symptoms of pregnant women after treatment immediately, and the difference was statistically significant. Similarly, at postpartum (<4 months), the results showed that the CBT group was superior to the usual care group in improving depression symptoms of pregnant women. However, there was no statistical difference at postpartum (>4 months). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural therapy can effectively relieve the symptoms of depression at short-term effect. However, its long-term effect need to be verified by further clinical studies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This meta-analysis suggested that cognitive behavioural therapy should be considered as a complementary programme for patients with perinatal depression. Medical workers could apply cognitive behavioural therapy into daily routine cares for perinatal depression."

Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) might be a low-threshold treatment to support affected AYA. In this randomized controlled pilot trial, the feasibility and potential efficacy of youthCOACHCD, an iCBT targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in AYA with chronic medical conditions, was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 30 AYA (Mage 16.13; SD= 2.34; 73% female), aged 12-21 years either suffering from cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis or type 1 diabetes, were randomly assigned to either a guided version of the iCBT youthCOACHCD (IG, n=15) or to a waitlist control group (CG, n=15), receiving an unguided version of the iCBT six months post-randomization. Participants of the IG and the CG were assessed before (t0), twelve weeks after (t1) and six months after (t2) randomization. Primary outcome was the feasibility of the iCBT. Different parameters of feasibility e.g. acceptance, client satisfaction or potential side effects were evaluated. First indications of the possible efficacy with regard to the primary efficacy outcome, the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale, and further outcome variables were evaluated using linear regression models, adjusting for baseline values. RESULTS: Regarding feasibility, intervention completion was 60%; intervention satisfaction (M = 25.42, SD = 5.85) and perceived therapeutic alliance (M = 2.83, SD = 1.25) were moderate and comparable to other iCBTs. No patterns emerged regarding subjective and objective negative side effects due to participation in youthCOACHCD. Estimates of potential efficacy showed between group differences, with a potential medium-term benefit of youthCOACHCD (β = -0.55, 95%CI: -1.17; 0.07), but probably not short-term (β = 0.20, 95%CI: -0.47; 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to the feasibility of youthCOACHCD and the implementation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial addressing its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Due to the small sample size, conclusions are premature, however, further strategies to foster treatment adherence should be considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00016714 , 25/03/2019)."

Self-directed online CBT interventions have made CBT more accessible at a lower cost. However, adherence is often poor and, in the absence of therapist support, effects are modest and short-term. Delivering CBT online using instant messaging is clinically and cost-effective; however, most existing platforms are limited to instant messaging sessions, without the support of between-session ""homework"" activities. The INTERACT intervention integrates online CBT materials and 'high-intensity' therapist-led CBT, delivered remotely in real-time. The INTERACT trial will evaluate this novel integration in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to therapists and clients. METHODS: Pragmatic, two parallel-group multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial, with 434 patients recruited from primary care practices in Bristol, London and York. Participants with depression will be identified via General Practitioner record searches and direct referrals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: aged ≥ 18 years; score ≥ 14 on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II); meeting International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for depression. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: alcohol or substance dependency in the past year; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; psychosis; dementia; currently under psychiatric care for depression (including those referred but not yet seen); cannot complete questionnaires unaided or requires an interpreter; currently receiving CBT/other psychotherapy; received high-intensity CBT in the past four years; participating in another intervention trial; unwilling/unable to receive CBT via computer/laptop/smartphone. Eligible participants will be randomised to integrated CBT or usual care. Integrated CBT utilises the standard Beckian intervention for depression and comprises nine live therapist-led sessions, with (up to) a further three if clinically appropriate. The first session is 60-90 min via videocall, with subsequent 50-min sessions delivered online, using instant messaging. Participants allocated integrated CBT can access integrated online CBT resources (worksheets/information sheets/videos) within and between sessions. Outcome assessments at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score at 6 months (as a continuous variable). A nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation will be conducted. DISCUSSION: If clinically and cost-effective, this model of integrated CBT could be introduced into existing psychological services, increasing access to, and equity of, CBT provision.

Brief interventions (eg, single session) that are augmented by follow-on automated mobile health intervention may expand treatment access. This was a randomized single-blind controlled trial with 255 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: CBT2go, which combined one individual session of cognitive behavioral therapy with automated thought challenging/adaptive behavior delivered through mobile devices; Self-Monitoring (SM), which combined single-session illness psychoeducation with self-monitoring of symptoms; and treatment-as-usual (TAU). Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (midpoint), 12 weeks (posttreatment), and 24 weeks (follow-up) with our primary outcome global psychopathology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-expanded version [BPRS-24]), and secondary outcomes community functioning (Specific Level of Function; SLOF) and defeatist performance beliefs (DPBs). We also collected data on adverse events. Outcome analyses on the primary outcome, BPRS Total score, indicated a significant time (0-24 wk) by group interaction with significant but modest improvement comparing two active conditions (CBT2go and SM) relative to TAU. Effects of CBT2go were not different from SM. There was a significant time × group interaction with better SLOF scores in CBT2go across 24 weeks, but not in SM. There were no time-by-group effects on DPBs. DPBs decreased in the CBT2go condition but not in SM. These results indicated that single intervention augmented by mobile intervention was feasible and associated with small yet sustained effects on global psychopathology and, when inclusive of CBT, community function compared with usual care."

DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis alongside the randomized controlled ENTER trial. SETTING: Center for Telepsychiatry, Mental Health Services in the Region of Southern Denmark, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 76 patients suffering from MDD. INTERVENTIONS: The patients in the intervention group received blended CBT treatment comprising a combination of online modules and face-to-face consultations with a psychologist. The patients in the control group received standard CBT treatment, that is, solely face-to-face consultations with a psychologist. The treatment period was 12 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. A micro-costing approach was applied to evaluate the savings derived. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels questionnaire at the baseline and the six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Data for 74 patients were included in the primary analysis. The adjusted QALY difference between blended CBT and standard CBT was -0.0291 (95% CI: -0.0535 to -0.0047), and the adjusted difference in costs was -£226.32 (95% CI: -300.86 to -151.77). Blended CBT was estimated to have a 6.6% and 3.1% probability of being cost-effective based on thresholds of £20,000 and £30,000. CONCLUSION: Compared to standard CBT, blended CBT represents a cost-saving but also a loss in QALYs for patients suffering from MDD. However, results should be carefully interpreted, given the small sample size. Future research involving larger replication studies focusing on other aspects of blended CBT with more patient involvement is advised. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrial.gov: S-20150150."

This study aims to assess the effects of DHT-based psychological interventions on anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life among cancer survivors. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool RoB 2 was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to check if the interventions reviewed were described in detail to be implemented in the clinical setting. Data synthesis was conducted in Review Manager (Version 5.4), and the effect size was calculated by the standardized mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. The certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: This meta-analysis encompassed 46 randomized controlled trials, involving 5211 participants. DHT-based psychological interventions significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.59/-0.24), depression (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.39/-0.13), sleep disturbance (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI -0.64/-0.14), fatigue (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI -0.77/-0.17), and improved quality of life (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI 0.22/0.62). Subgroup analysis indicated that interventions lasting for a duration of ≥ 12 weeks, and integrated interventions might be the most effective in addressing adverse psychological outcomes. And cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions demonstrated significant effectiveness in managing sleep disturbance. CONCLUSION: DHT-based psychological interventions might be effective for improving anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life in cancer survivors. We cannot draw definitive conclusions due to intervention and study design heterogeneity. Further rigorous trials are crucial to identify optimal interventions for different types of cancers, determine suitable durations, specify types of DHT-based psychological interventions and validate intervention therapies."

BACKGROUND: There is compelling evidence that psychological factors may have the same or even greater impact on the possibility of adverse events on cardiac diseases (CD) than other traditional clinical risk factors. Anxiety and depression are predictors of short- and long-term adverse outcomes, increased risk for higher rates of in-hospital complications, re-infarction, malignant arrhythmias, and mortality in CD patients. Despite researchers finding that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, the fact that such results are maintained only in the short term and the lack of maintenance of the long-term affects the absence of changes in lifestyles, preventing the possibility of a wide generalization of results. Recently wellbeing therapy (WBT) has been proposed as a useful approach to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce psychological distress. METHODS/DESIGN: The present randomized controlled study will test WBT, in comparison with CBT, as far as the reduction of symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress, and the improvement of lifestyle behaviors and quality of life in cardiac patients are concerned. Moreover, innovations in communication technologies allow patients to be constantly followed in real life. Therefore WBT based on personalized mobile technology will allow the testing of its effectiveness in comparison with usual WBT. DISCUSSION: The present study is a large outpatient study on the treatment of co-morbid depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in cardiac patients. The most important issues of this study are its randomized design, the focus on promotion of health-related behaviors, and the use of innovative technologies supporting patients' wellbeing in real life and in a continuous way. First results are expected in 2012. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01543815."

Although pharmacological treatments like antidepressants are the mainstay treatment options, several mothers have concerns about their safety and potential side effects, especially breastfeeding mothers. There is an emerging interest in exploring the use of non-pharmacological interventions as an alternative treatment modality for PPD. This review focuses on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological options like cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, the use of mobile games, technological interventions, and creative art techniques. This review also highlights the existing gaps like the dearth of research from lower socioeconomic countries where postpartum women face several barriers in accessing the much-needed support as stigma surrounding mental health still exists and the lack of studies to assess the long-term effects of these interventions."

While research often emphasizes the frequency and intensity of guidance, less attention has been paid to the behaviors enacted by the therapists supporting clients using these interventions. A scoping review of the literature was conducted to systematically examine the evidence on therapist behaviors (i.e., the actions and feedback provided by supporters to patients). Applying broad eligibility criteria, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library, and Embase from their inception to January 1st 2024. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Following data extraction, a descriptive analysis and synthesis of the results was performed. Most studies (n = 12; 75 %) focused on therapist behaviors in the context of internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for anxiety and depression. While earlier studies primarily focused on identifying therapist behaviors, later studies shifted towards examining the associations between therapist behaviors and different outcomes, as well as deriving research and clinical applications for improving guided internet-delivered treatments. Identified gaps and recommendations for clinical practice, research, training, and treatment development are discussed."

We aimed to investigate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of remotely delivered problem-solving cognitive behaviour therapy (PSCBT) plus treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU in young people with repeat self-harm and depression. METHODS: Single-blind multi-centre RCT with an internal pilot, pre-set stop-go criteria and qualitative semi-structured interviews. Eligible participants (aged 16-30 years) were recruited from 9 adult or child and adolescent self-harm and crisis services; had ≥ 2 lifetime self-harm episodes, one in the preceding 96 h; and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score ≥ 17. Participants were randomised (1:1) to either TAU or TAU and 10-12 sessions of PSCBT delivered by mobile phone or video-calling. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were recruited (11 in each arm), 10 (46%) completed follow-up at 6 months, 9 (82%) started the PSCBT and 4 (36%) completed it. The study did not meet three of its four stop-go criteria, reflecting considerable barriers to recruitment and retention. Participants had severe depression symptoms: with mean BDI-II 38.9 in the PSCBT and 37.2 in TAU groups, respectively. Three (14%) unblindings occurred for immediate safety concerns. Barriers to recruitment and retention included lack of agency for participants, severity of depression, recency of crisis with burden for participants and clinicians who diagnosed depression according to pervasiveness. CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of PSCBT for young people with depression and self-harm are not feasible using recruitment through mental health services that conduct assessments following self-harm presentations. Clinician assessment following self-harm presentation mainly identifies those with severe rather than mild-moderate depression.

10.1002/da.22588,Improving late life depression and cognitive control through the use of therapeutic video game technology: A proof-of-concept randomized trial,"Anguera JA, Gunning FM, Areán PA.",Depress Anxiety,2017,2017.1.5,,,"BACKGROUND: Existing treatments for depression are known to have only modest effects, are insufficiently targeted, and are inconsistently utilized, particularly in older adults. Indeed, older adults with impaired cognitive control networks tend to demonstrate poor response to a majority of existing depression interventions. Cognitive control interventions delivered using entertainment software have the potential to not only target the underlying cerebral dysfunction associated with depression, but to do so in a manner that is engaging and engenders adherence to treatment protocol. METHODS: In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02229188), individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were randomized to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically inspired digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project: EVO™, n = 12). Given the overlapping functional neuroanatomy of mood disturbances and executive dysfunction, we explored the impact of an intervention targeting cognitive control abilities, functional disability, and mood in older adults suffering from LLD, and how those outcomes compare to a therapeutic gold standard. RESULTS: EVO participants demonstrated similar improvements in mood and self-reported function after 4 weeks of treatment to PST participants. The EVO participants also showed generalization to untrained measures of working memory and attention, as well as negativity bias, a finding not evident in the PST condition. Individuals assigned to EVO demonstrated 100% adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary findings that this therapeutic video game targeting cognitive control deficits may be an efficacious LLD intervention. Future research is needed to confirm these findings."

METHODS: The study used a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial design with data drawn from phase 1 of a two-phase small business innovation research study. In total, 215 adults (ages ≥18 years) with depression received care from Talkspace, a digital mental health care company. Participants were initially randomly assigned to receive either asynchronous MBP or weekly VCP. All therapists provided evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. After 6 weeks of treatment, participants whose condition did not show a response on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or was rated as having not improved on the Clinical Global Impressions scale were randomly reassigned to receive either weekly VCP plus MBP or monthly VCP plus MBP. Longitudinal mixed-effects models with piecewise linear time trends applied to multiple imputed data sets were used to address missingness of data. RESULTS: Participants who were initially assigned to the MBP condition engaged with their therapists over more weeks than did participants in the VCP condition (7.8 weeks for MBP vs. 4.9 weeks for VCP; p<0.001). No meaningful differences were observed between the two groups in rates of change by 6 or 12 weeks for depression, anxiety, disability, or global ratings of improvement. Neither treatment resulted in any adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: MBP appears to be a viable alternative to VCP for treating adults with depression."

Face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions for depression can be challenging, so there is a need for other alternatives that allow these interventions to be offered. One feasible alternative is Internet-based psychological interventions. This is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effectiveness of an Internet-based intervention on depression in primary health care in Spain. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of a low-intensity therapist-guided (LITG) Internet-based program and a completely self-guided (CSG) Internet-based program with improved treatment as usual (iTAU) care for depression. METHODS: Multicenter, three-arm, parallel, RCT design, carried out between November 2012 and January 2014, with a follow-up of 15 months. In total, 296 adults from primary care settings in four Spanish regions, with mild or moderate major depression, were randomized to LITG (n=96), CSG (n=98), or iTAU (n=102). Research completers at follow-up were 63.5%. The intervention was Smiling is Fun, an Internet program based on cognitive behavioral therapy. All patients received iTAU by their general practitioners. Moreover, LITG received Smiling is Fun and the possibility of psychotherapeutic support on request by email, whereas CSG received only Smiling is Fun. The main outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory-II at 3 months from baseline. Mixed-effects multilevel analysis for repeated measures were undertaken. RESULTS: There was no benefit for either CSG [(B coefficient=-1.15; P=.444)] or LITG [(B=-0.71; P=.634)] compared to iTAU, at 3 months. There were differences at 6 months [iTAU vs CSG (B=-4.22; P=.007); iTAU vs LITG (B=-4.34; P=.005)] and 15 months [iTAU vs CSG (B=-5.10; P=.001); iTAU vs LITG (B=-4.62; P=.002)]. There were no differences between CSG and LITG at any time. Adjusted and intention-to-treat models confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: An Internet-based intervention for depression combined with iTAU conferred a benefit over iTAU alone in the Spanish primary health care system.

10.2196/jmir.6914,Automated Text Messaging as an Adjunct to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: A Clinical Trial,"Aguilera A, Bruehlman-Senecal E, Demasi O, Avila P.",J Med Internet Res,2017,2017.5.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression is efficacious, but effectiveness is limited when implemented in low-income settings due to engagement difficulties including nonadherence with skill-building homework and early discontinuation of treatment. Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group CBT treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients. METHODS: Patients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT skills. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=-2.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=-1.65, P=.10). Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=-.29, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.19, z=-5.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=-.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.07, z=-3.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in CBT for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment."

Affecting over 1% of the global population, these disorders contribute significantly to disability and mortality, often due to suicide and cardiovascular disease. Diagnostic challenges arise from symptom overlap with unipolar depression, frequently leading to delays. Bipolar disorders are driven by complex genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors and are commonly accompanied by psychiatric and medical comorbidities, further complicating diagnosis and treatment. Standard management strategies include mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and selective use of antidepressants, complemented by psychosocial interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychoeducation, which are vital for relapse prevention. Despite recent advancements, the management of bipolar disorders remains challenging, constrained by clinical variability, an absence of specific biomarkers, and differences in approved treatments and treatment guidelines across regions. Emerging research underscores the potential of precision psychiatry and digital health tools to enhance diagnosis and treatment. Nonetheless, critical gaps persist, particularly in implementing equitable care worldwide. This review offers a comprehensive update on bipolar disorders, examining clinical presentation, early diagnosis, pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies, and future perspectives to guide clinicians and researchers in addressing these ongoing challenges in research and clinical practice.

The development of eHealth interventions that simultaneously address obesity and mental health can be supportive in this regard. However, evidence of the efficacy of eHealth interventions in the treatment of depression symptoms in individuals with obesity is lacking. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the efficacy of existing eHealth interventions for individuals with obesity that target depression symptoms. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus) to identify studies published in English between January 2016 and January 2023, that focused on eHealth interventions, targeting depression symptoms in individuals with obesity people. Exclusion criteria were study objectives that (1) focused specifically on one or more metabolic comorbidities of individuals with obesity, e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes; (2) focused specifically on eating disorders comorbidities e.g., binge eating disorder, and (3) focused specifically on patients before or after bariatric surgery. RESULTS: The database search identified 214 records. Six articles were included in this review. Sample sizes ranged from 70 to 1267 participants of ages 18-60 years. All included studies were randomized controlled trials. Two of the six included studies were web-based interventions guided either by medical doctors or psychologists. All interventions included video, printed materials, and interactive parts of which two studies integrated elements of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Social Cognitive Therapy. The findings showed that eHealth treatment services, supported and guided throughout the intervention had high acceptance and efficacy in the reduction of depression symptoms among individuals with obesity. CONCLUSION: EHealth interventions that address and target both mental and physical health with interactive strategies calls for better efficacy in the reduction of depression symptoms. Future eHealth interventions that target depression symptoms in individuals with obesity should integrate digital strategies that address both mental and physical health through interactive modules."

Effect sizes were large for improvement in the primary symptom domain of each treatment group: depression (d = 1.48), social anxiety disorder (d = 1.01), and panic disorder (d = 1.15). In ICBT for depression, having no previous experience of psychological treatment (r = 0.21), and more frequent baseline negative automatic thoughts (r = 0.20) predicted larger improvement. In ICBT for panic disorder, having more baseline safety behaviors (r = 0.25) predicted larger improvement.

An Analysis of Engagement with a Texting Adjunct for Psychotherapy,"Figueroa CA, DeMasi O, Hernandez-Ramos R, Aguilera A.",Telemed J E Health,2021,2020.3.28,,,"Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established treatment for depression, but its success is often impeded by low attendance. Supportive text messages assessing participants' mood in between sessions might increase attendance to in-clinic CBT, although it is not fully understood who benefits most from these interventions and how. This study examined (1) user groups showing different profiles of study engagement and (2) associations between increased response rates to mood texts and psychotherapy attendance. Methods: We included 73 participants who attended Group CBT (GCBT) in a primary care clinic and participated in a supportive automated text-messaging intervention. Using unsupervised machine learning, we identified and characterized subgroups with similar combinations of total texting responsiveness and total GCBT attendance. We used mixed-effects models to explore the association between increased previous week response rate and subsequent week in-clinic GCBT attendance and, conversely, response rate following attendance. Results: Participants could be divided into four clusters of overall study engagement, showing distinct profiles in age and prior texting knowledge. The response rate to texts in the week before GCBT was not associated with GCBT attendance, although the relationship was moderated by age; there was a positive relationship for younger, but not older, participants. Attending GCBT was, however, associated with higher response rate the week after an attended session. Conclusion: User groups of study engagement differ in texting knowledge and age. Younger participants might benefit more from supportive texting interventions when their purpose is to increase psychotherapy attendance. Our results have implications for tailoring digital interventions to user groups and for understanding therapeutic effects of these interventions."

This study aimed to compare the HRQoL of people with depression and age-matched people in the Vietnamese population, evaluate the effects of Tele-SSM intervention on HRQoL, and examine the association between the changes in HRQoL score and mental health well-being (depression, anxiety, and stress). METHODS: This study was a pre- and post-study involving Vietnamese adults aged 18-64 who had depression symptoms (score ≥ 5 points in the PHQ-9). Participants (N = 58) completed Tele-SSM-a supported self-management intervention incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy and non-violent communication and using a task-shifting approach. To compare with the general population, we conducted a 1-to-1 matching by age with an EQ-5D-5L valuation study with a nationally representative sample of the Vietnamese general population. RESULTS: HRQoL was significantly impaired in people with depression compared to the age-matched general population. Regarding health profile, participants reported the most difficulties in usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression dimensions. Significant improvements were observed in HRQoL scores post-intervention compared to pre-intervention in both EQ-VAS scores (from 59.84 to 79.48) and utility scores (from 0.79 to 0.90). These results remained lower than the age-matched general population (EQ-VAS score = 83.28, utility score = 0.96). Depression was associated with lower HRQoL while controlling for stress, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HRQoL is significantly impaired in people with depression and contribute to providing empirical evidence of Tele-SSM intervention in improving HRQoL. Further randomized controlled trials should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Tele-SSM intervention."

We evaluated symptoms of depression using the Personal Health Questionnaire-9. The Personal Health Questionnaire-9 decreased from an average of 14.8 at the beginning of the intervention, to 6.1 at the end of the text messaging period. All of the women reported that they liked receiving the messages, they found them useful and they felt that the messages had improved their health. Text messages are acceptable to women users who are recipients of public health and social services. Future research should focus more on the evaluation of the results and on how the specific content and aspects of text messaging improve health outcomes."

Baseline to 12-month changes showed additional favorable effects for anxiety (between-group mean differences [MDs] = 0.79, P = 0.047), depression (MD = 1.08, P = 0.004), self-regulatory fatigue (MD = 2.42, P = 0.021), pain catastrophizing (MD = 2.62, P = 0.009), and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The EPIO program aims to improve outreach of evidence-based pain self-management interventions. Findings demonstrate how using EPIO can lead to sustainable psychological change, enhancing mental health and health-related quality of life for people suffering from pain, providing a chance to live well with the pain."
10.1016/j.invent.2018.01.002,Barriers and facilitators for the implementation of blended psychotherapy for depression: A qualitative pilot study of therapists' perspective,"Titzler I, Saruhanjan K, Berking M, Riper H, Ebert DD.",Internet Interv,2018,2018.8.24,,,"INTRODUCTION: Blended therapies (BT) combine face-to-face (f2f) sessions with internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). However, the use of blended interventions in routine care is still rare and depends on the acceptance of key health care professionals such as the therapists. Little is yet known about the therapists' perspective on and experiences with blended approaches. The aim of this pilot study was to identify barriers and facilitators, as perceived by psychotherapists, for implementing a blended therapy for depression. METHODS: Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with five therapists, who were part of the German study arm of the FP7-project E-Compared (www.e-compared.eu). All patients (N = 173) were treated in the context of a registered RCT (DRKS00006866) in which the clinical and cost-effectiveness of BT for depression, consisting of ten internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy modules and six f2f sessions, was compared to the treatment usually provided by general practitioners. To identify barriers and facilitators an interview guide based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF) was developed. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis by two independent coders. RESULTS: The results revealed 29 barriers and 33 facilitators, which are hindering or enabling factors on the levels of 'implementation in the health care system', 'therapy', 'therapists' and 'patients'. Key barriers stated by all therapists were 'Limited customizability and autonomy of decisions concerning blending the therapy' (number of statements, k = 44); 'Disease-related contraindications for BT' (k = 25); 'Negative affect was caused by burden through technical problems' (k = 18); 'Limited number of f2f sessions hindered the therapy process'; and 'Establishment of therapeutic alliance was burdened by technical issues' (each k = 15). Key facilitators stated by all therapists were: 'Patients' interest, willingness and motivation to participate' (k = 22); 'Patients' access to online content between f2f sessions and after therapy end' (k = 20); 'Preset structure of IMI-part guided the treatment course of BT' (k = 18); and 'Effective help with BT in a short time frame' (k = 15), as well as 'Reduction of the treatment gap' (k = 13). DISCUSSION: Therapists supported the implementation of BT for depression. Results indicated the consideration of a wide range of determinants: among others, the possibility of individualizing the treatment; the autonomy of decision making in respect to the ratio and number of online and f2f sessions; the necessity of providing training; the need to develop a concept of embedding BT in the health care system and funding the additional effort; and the use of sophisticated technical solutions."
10.2196/58217,Efficacy of eHealth Versus In-Person Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Equivalence,"Knutzen SM, Christensen DS, Cairns P, Damholdt MF, Amidi A, Zachariae R.",JMIR Ment Health,2024,2024.8.26,,,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent condition with significant health, societal, and economic impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is recommended as the first-line treatment. With limited accessibility to in-person-delivered CBTI (ipCBTI), electronically delivered eHealth CBTI (eCBTI), ranging from telephone- and videoconference-delivered interventions to fully automated web-based programs and mobile apps, has emerged as an alternative. However, the relative efficacy of eCBTI compared to ipCBTI has not been conclusively determined. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the comparability of eCBTI and ipCBTI through a systematic review and meta-analysis of equivalence based on randomized controlled trials directly comparing the 2 delivery formats. METHODS: A comprehensive search across multiple databases was conducted, leading to the identification and analysis of 15 unique randomized head-to-head comparisons of ipCBTI and eCBTI. Data on sleep and nonsleep outcomes were extracted and subjected to both conventional meta-analytical methods and equivalence testing based on predetermined equivalence margins derived from previously suggested minimal important differences. Supplementary Bayesian analyses were conducted to determine the strength of the available evidence. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 15 studies with a total of 1083 participants. Conventional comparisons generally favored ipCBTI. However, the effect sizes were small, and the 2 delivery formats were statistically significantly equivalent (P<.05) for most sleep and nonsleep outcomes. Additional within-group analyses showed that both formats led to statistically significant improvements (P<.05) in insomnia severity; sleep quality; and secondary outcomes such as fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Heterogeneity analyses highlighted the role of treatment duration and dropout rates as potential moderators of the differences in treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: eCBTI and ipCBTI were found to be statistically significantly equivalent for treating insomnia for most examined outcomes, indicating eCBTI as a clinically relevant alternative to ipCBTI. This supports the expansion of eCBTI as a viable option to increase accessibility to effective insomnia treatment. Nonetheless, further research is needed to address the limitations noted, including the high risk of bias in some studies and the potential impact of treatment duration and dropout rates on efficacy.

Early evidence indicates that cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) improves maternal sleep and mood. However, standard CBTI may be less efficacious in perinatal women than the broader insomnia population. This study sought to identify patient characteristics in a perinatal sample associated with poor response to CBTI, and characterize patient feedback to identify areas of insomnia therapy to tailor for the perinatal experience. PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis of 46 pregnant women with insomnia symptoms who were treated with digital CBTI in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We assessed insomnia, cognitive arousal, and depression before and after prenatal treatment, then 6 weeks postpartum. Patients provided feedback on digital CBTI. RESULTS: Residual cognitive arousal after treatment was the most robust factor associated with treatment non-response. Critically, CBTI responders and non-responders differed on no other sociodemographic or pretreatment metrics. After childbirth, short sleep (<6 hrs/night) was associated with maternal reports of poor infant sleep quality. Patient feedback indicated that most patients preferred online treatment to in-person treatment. Although women described digital CBTI as convenient and helpful, many patients indicated that insomnia therapy would be improved if it addressed sleep challenges unique to pregnancy and postpartum. Patients requested education on maternal and infant sleep, flexibility in behavioral sleep strategies, and guidance to manage infant sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Modifying insomnia therapy to better alleviate refractory cognitive arousal and address the changing needs of women as they progress through pregnancy and early parenting may increase efficacy for perinatal insomnia.Name: Insomnia and Rumination in Late Pregnancy and the Risk for Postpartum DepressionURL: clinicaltrials.govRegistration: NCT03596879."
10.1177/20552076241287059,From research to routine care: A historical review of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for adult mental health problems in Sweden,"Vernmark K, Buhrman M, Carlbring P, Hedman-Lagerlöf E, Kaldo V, Andersson G.",Digit Health,2024,2024.10.9,,,"This narrative historical review examines the development of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in Sweden, describing its progression within both academic and routine care settings. The review encompasses key publications, significant scientific findings, and contextual factors in real-world settings. Over 25 years ago, Sweden emerged as a pioneering force in internet-delivered treatment research for mental health. Since then, Swedish universities, in collaboration with research partners, have produced substantial research demonstrating the efficacy of ICBT across various psychological problems, including social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. Although research conducted in clinical settings has been less frequent than in academic contexts, it has confirmed the effectiveness of therapist-supported ICBT programs for mild-to-moderate mental health problems in routine care. Early on, ICBT was provided as an option for patients at both the primary care level and in specialized clinics, using treatment programs developed by both public and private providers. The development of a national platform for delivering internet-based treatment and the use of procurement in selecting ICBT programs and providers are factors that have shaped the current routine care landscape. However, gaps persist in understanding how to optimize the integration of digital treatment in routine care, warranting further research and the use of specific implementation frameworks and outcomes. This historical perspective on the research and delivery of ICBT in Sweden over two decades offers insights for the international community into the development and broad dissemination of a specific digital mental health intervention within a national context."

We aimed to explore adolescents' views on the appeal of a tested computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) for depression (SPARX), and a revised version (SPARX-R). The versions were similar but while SPARX is presented explicitly as a treatment for depression, SPARX-R is presented as providing skills that could be useful for young people for when they were depressed, down, angry, or stressed. Methods: We held 9 focus groups with a total of 79 adolescents (13-19 years old; 47 females; 34 New Zealand European; 22 Māori or Pacific; 60 reported having experienced feeling down or low for at least several days in a row). Groups viewed the opening sequences of SPARX and SPARX-R (in random order), then took part in a semi-structured discussion and completed a brief questionnaire. Responses were analyzed using a general inductive approach. Results: Participants considered both SPARX and SPARX-R useful and considered the stated purpose of the program to be important. Four themes contrasted the two approaches. The first, ""naming depression is risky"", referred to perceptions that an explicit focus on depression could be off-putting, including for adolescents with depression. The second theme of ""universality"" reflected preferences for a universal approach as young people might not recognize that they were depressed, and all would benefit from the program. In contrast, ""validation"" reflected the view of a significant minority that naming depression could be validating for some. Finally, the theme of ""choice"" reflected a near-unanimously expressed preference for both options to be offered, allowing user choice. In questionnaire responses, 40 (68%) of participants preferred SPARX-R, 13 (18%) preferred SPARX, while 10 (14%) ""didn't mind"". Responses were similar among participants who reported that they had experienced at least a few days of low mood and those who had not. Conclusions: The way a CCBT program is presented may have implications for its appeal. The potential population impact of CCBT programs explicitly targeting depression and those targeting more universal feelings such as being stressed or feeling depressed should be explored for varied user groups."

School-based digital interventions targeting at-risk youth are a promising avenue for suicide prevention, and some evidence has shown that blending digital and face-to-face components may improve the effectiveness. However, further evidence on its acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness is needed, especially in Latin America, where mental health support is limited. Reframe-IT is an internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program to reduce youth suicidal ideation in school settings. We created four complementary face-to-face CBT sessions and, through a pilot study, tested the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of a blended intervention (Reframe-IT +) in adolescents (N = 52) from 6 public schools in Chile, randomized into two groups: Reframe-IT + (N = 33) and Control (N = 19). We found that the intervention was acceptable and feasible, with high degrees of satisfaction and adherence. We also observed a significant reduction in suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention. Our results suggest that the Reframe-IT + could be delivered as a suitable, acceptable, and effective intervention to reduce suicide ideation in adolescents in school settings. Further research is needed to confirm these preliminary results."

However, few studies have examined its cost-effectiveness in low-resource countries and under nonspecialist routine care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term cost utility of unguided ICBT compared to a waitlist control for persons with MDD from the perspectives of society and the health care system. METHODS: This analysis was implemented alongside an 8-week 2-arm randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up period conducted in Shenzhen, China. Outcomes including cost and health utility were collected at the pretreatment and posttreatment time points and 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. Direct medical costs and indirect costs were prospectively collected using the hospital information system and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Health outcomes were measured using the Chinese version of the Short-Form Six-Dimension health index. The primary outcome was incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) expressed as the difference in costs between 2 therapies by the difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The seemingly unrelated regression model and the bootstrap method were performed to estimate adjusted ICURs. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were used to demonstrate uncertainty. A series of scenario analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: In total, 244 participants with MDD were randomly allocated to the ICBT (n=122, 50%) or waitlist control (n=122, 50%) groups. At the pretreatment time point, no statistically significant difference was observed in direct medical cost (P=.41), indirect cost (P=.10), or health utility (P=.11) between the 2 groups. In the base-case analysis, the ICBT group reported higher direct medical costs and better quality of life but lower total costs at the posttreatment time point. The adjusted ICURs at the posttreatment time point were CN ¥-194,720.38 (US $-26,551.50; 95% CI CN ¥-198,766.78 to CN ¥-190,673.98 [US $-27,103.20 to US $-25,999.70]) and CN ¥49,700.33 (US $6776.99; 95% CI CN ¥46,626.34-CN ¥52,774.31 [US $6357.83-$7196.15]) per QALY from the societal and health care system perspectives, respectively, with a probability of unguided ICBT being cost-effective of 75.93% and 54.4%, respectively, if the willingness to pay was set at 1 time the per-capita gross domestic product. In the scenario analyses, the probabilities increased to 76.85% and 77.61%, respectively, indicating the potential of ICBT to be cost-effective over the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Unguided ICBT is a cost-effective treatment for MDD. This intervention not only helps patients with MDD improve clinically but also generates societal savings. These findings provide health economic evidence for a potential scalable MDD treatment method in low- and middle-income countries.

Whilst there is strong evidence for late-life anxiety treatment using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and delivery via telehealth, there is little evidence for the remote delivery of psychological treatment for anxiety in people living with MCI and dementia. This paper reports the protocol for the Tech-CBT study which aims to investigate the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, usability and acceptability of a technology-assisted and remotely delivered CBT intervention to enhance delivery of anxiety treatment for people living with MCI and dementia of any aetiology. METHODS: A hybrid II single-blind, parallel-group randomised trial of a Tech-CBT intervention (n = 35) versus usual care (n = 35), with in-built mixed methods process and economic evaluations to inform future scale-up and implementation into clinical practice. The intervention (i) consists of six weekly sessions delivered by postgraduate psychology trainees via telehealth video-conferencing, (ii) incorporates voice assistant app technology for home-based practice, and (iii) utilises a purpose-built digital platform, My Anxiety Care. The primary outcome is change in anxiety as measured by the Rating Anxiety in Dementia scale. Secondary outcomes include change in quality of life and depression, and outcomes for carers. The process evaluation will be guided by evaluation frameworks. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of participants (n = 10) and carers (n = 10), to evaluate acceptability and feasibility, as well as factors influencing participation and adherence. Interviews will also be conducted with therapists (n = 18) and wider stakeholders (n = 18), to explore contextual factors and barriers/facilitators to future implementation and scalability. A cost-utility analysis will be undertaken to determine the cost-effectiveness of Tech-CBT compared to usual care. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to evaluate a novel technology-assisted CBT intervention to reduce anxiety in people living with MCI and dementia. Other potential benefits include improved quality of life for people with cognitive impairment and their care partners, improved access to psychological treatment regardless of geographical location, and upskilling of the psychological workforce in anxiety treatment for people living with MCI and dementia.

10.1186/s12888-023-04803-y,Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of online interpretation bias intervention on stress reactivity in the children of parents with depression: the CoCo study,"Frommelt T, Bäumler L, Rohleder N, Schulte-Körne G, Platt B.",BMC Psychiatry,2023,2023.5.30,,,"BACKGROUND: Current preventive interventions for the children of parents with depression demonstrate modest effects on depression incidence. This may be because existing interventions tend to comprise general psychotherapeutic tools, rather than targeting the specific mechanisms underlying familial transmission. Improved theoretical models of familial transmission could enhance the development of targeted interventions. Although existing models assume that cognitive and biological vulnerability factors influence one another, the precise mechanisms are unknown. This project is the first to experimentally test whether negative interpretation bias has an impact on cortisol response in children of parents with depression. This study protocol reports a randomised controlled trial of an interpretation bias intervention which aims to shift participants' interpretation bias in a more positive direction and thereby alter their stress response. METHODS: Children aged 10-14 years who have i) one parent with a current or previous depression diagnosis, with at least one episode occurring during the child's lifetime and ii) do not have a current or previous psychiatric diagnosis themselves, will be assigned to one of two conditions: an interpretation bias intervention (n = 50) or a structurally similar placebo intervention (n = 50). The interpretation bias intervention consists of a short lab-based cognitive reappraisal of interpretations training, a four-week app-based Cognitive Bias Modification of Interpretations intervention and interpretation bias specific if-then plans. Interpretation bias will be assessed before and after the intervention using the Scrambled Sentences Task. The effect of the intervention on participants' stress response will be assessed by salivary cortisol collected at five different time points: from immediately before until 45 min after administering the Trier Social Stressor Test for Children. Stress reactivity will be measured via baseline to peak cortisol and stress recovery will be measured via the 45 min cortisol marker. We hypothesise that children who participate in the interpretation bias intervention will display a positive shift in interpretation bias and this, in turn, will alter their stress response. Children who receive the placebo intervention are expected to show a smaller positive shift in interpretation bias and stress reactivity. DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study will contribute to models of familial depression transmission as well as informing preventive interventions. If training a more positive interpretation bias subsequently alters participants' stress response, then incorporating such tools may increase the efficacy of existing preventive interventions.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15633,Effectiveness of a Digital Cognitive Behavior Therapy-Guided Self-Help Intervention for Eating Disorders in College Women: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial,"Fitzsimmons-Craft EE, Taylor CB, Graham AK, Sadeh-Sharvit S, Balantekin KN, Eichen DM, Monterubio GE, Goel NJ, Flatt RE, Karam AM, Firebaugh ML, Jacobi C, Jo B, Trockel MT, Wilfley DE.",JAMA Netw Open,2020,2020.9.1,,,"Comment in JAMA Netw Open. 2020 Aug 3;3(8):e2016117. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.16117. IMPORTANCE: Eating disorders (EDs) are common, serious psychiatric disorders on college campuses, yet most affected individuals do not receive treatment. Digital interventions have the potential to bridge this gap. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a coached, digital, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention improves outcomes for college women with EDs compared with referral to usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized trial was conducted from 2014 to 2018 at 27 US universities. Women with binge-purge EDs (with both threshold and subthreshold presentations) were recruited from enrolled universities. The 690 participants were followed up for up to 2 years after the intervention. Data analysis was performed from February to September 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Universities were randomized to the intervention, Student Bodies-Eating Disorders, a digital CBT-guided self-help program, or to referral to usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was change in overall ED psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were abstinence from binge eating and compensatory behaviors, as well as ED behavior frequencies, depression, anxiety, clinical impairment, academic impairment, and realized treatment access. RESULTS: A total of 690 women with EDs (mean [SD] age, 22.12 [4.85] years; 414 [60.0%] White; 120 [17.4%] Hispanic; 512 [74.2%] undergraduates) were included in the analyses. For ED psychopathology, there was a significantly greater reduction in the intervention group compared with the control group at the postintervention assessment (β [SE], -0.44 [0.10]; d = -0.40; t1387 = -4.23; P < .001), as well as over the follow-up period (β [SE], -0.39 [0.12]; d = -0.35; t1387 = -3.30; P < .001). There was not a significant difference in abstinence from any ED behaviors at the postintervention assessment (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.48-4.62; P = .50) or at follow-up (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.63-3.58; P = .36). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had significantly greater reductions in binge eating (rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96; P = .02), compensatory behaviors (rate ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P < .001), depression (β [SE], -1.34 [0.53]; d = -0.22; t1387 = -2.52; P = .01), and clinical impairment (β [SE], -2.33 [0.94]; d = -0.21; t1387 = -2.49; P = .01) at the postintervention assessment, with these gains sustained through follow-up for all outcomes except binge eating. Groups did not differ in terms of academic impairment. The majority of intervention participants (318 of 385 participants [83%]) began the intervention, whereas only 28% of control participants (76 of 271 participants with follow-up data available) sought treatment for their ED (odds ratio, 12.36; 95% CI, 8.73-17.51; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster randomized clinical trial comparing a coached, digital CBT intervention with referral to usual care, the intervention was effective in reducing ED psychopathology, compensatory behaviors, depression, and clinical impairment through long-term follow-up, as well as realizing treatment access. No difference was found between the intervention and control groups for abstinence for all ED behaviors or academic impairment. Given its scalability, a coached, digital, CBT intervention for college women with EDs has the potential to address the wide treatment gap for these disorders.

In caring for the young person, families endure high levels of stress and depression. Meanwhile, the social networks of families often erode. Our group has previously shown that family cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) leads to significantly improved perceived stress compared with specialist first-episode treatment as usual; however, there are well-known barriers to the dissemination of effective family interventions. To address this, we have developed a novel online intervention entitled 'Altitudes' that fully integrates purpose-built online social networking, expert and peer moderation, and evidence-based psychoeducation within a single application. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Altitudes in reducing stress in carers over a 6-month period. METHODS/DESIGN: We describe here a single-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with permutated blocks. The clusters comprise individual families. The two treatment conditions include Altitudes plus Specialist Treatment as Usual (STAU) and STAU alone. Altitudes involves participation in our novel online programme whereas STAU comprises specialist family work at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC), Melbourne, Australia. We aim to recruit 160 family members of young, 15-27 year-old, patients registered for treatment for first-episode psychosis (FEP) at EPPIC. The design includes two assessment time points, namely, baseline and 6-month follow-up. The study is due for completion within 2 years including an 18-month recruitment period and a 6-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is carers' perceived stress at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures include a biomarker of stress, depressive symptoms, worry, substance use, loneliness, social support, satisfaction with life, and a range of measures that tap into coping resources. We seek to gain a dynamic picture of carer stress through our Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment (SEMA) tool. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate an online intervention for carers of young people recovering from FEP. It has the potential to produce evidence in support of a highly novel, accessible, and cost-effective intervention to reduce stress in carers who are providing support to young people at a critical phase in their recovery from psychosis.

However, to our knowledge, no investigation has been conducted to understand complex pathways through which barriers to care (i.e. structural, attitudinal and technological) correlate with patient interest in ICBT. AIM: The objective of this study is to develop and test a pathway analysis framework using structural equation modeling to understand direct and mediating associations of barriers to care with interest in ICBT. METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted among adult (>18 years) urban and rural residents (n = 200) in Saskatchewan, Canada. An online survey assessed interest in ICBT, barriers to ICBT, demographics, and depression and anxiety symptoms. Utilizing structural equation modeling, a path analysis framework was developed. RESULTS: Path analysis results showed how associations between complex barriers and demographic variables correlate with interest in ICBT. For instance, the negative association of perceived financial concerns and life chaos on interest in ICBT was mediated by perceived access to care. CONCLUSION: The findings identify specific barriers that could be addressed through targeted population health interventions to improve uptake of ICBT."

Research should explore novel approaches to behavioral support to meet treatment need, including computer-assisted therapies such as Breaking Free Online (BFO). This study aimed to understand how participants' baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are associated with engagement with BFO, and how both participants' characteristics and their engagement may be associated with cannabis use and biopsychosocial functioning at follow-up. METHODS: An observational study with 1830 individuals presenting to UK-based publicly funded treatment services who reported cannabis as their primary problem substance and engaged with BFO as a self-directed intervention. RESULTS: Moderate-severe depression/anxiety (51%) and elevated severity of cannabis dependence scores (39%) characterized the baseline sample. Women demonstrated greater clinical complexity at baseline than men. Baseline mental health and biopsychosocial functioning were associated with whether participants completed a follow-up assessment. Among 460 participants who completed a follow-up assessment, intervention engagement was positively associated with self-reported quality of life and biopsychosocial functioning at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis users demonstrated substantial clinical complexity at baseline, with depression/anxiety and biopsychosocial functioning being associated with BFO engagement. Greater BFO engagement was also associated with better quality of life and biopsychosocial functioning at follow-up. Some groups, including those with greater mental health and biopsychosocial impairment at baseline and women, may require support to engage with BFO to maximize clinical benefits."

RAINBOW is a type 1 hybrid design randomized controlled trial. The objective is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness and implementation potential of an integrated, technology-enhanced, collaborative care model for treating comorbid obesity and depression in primary care. Obese and depressed adults (n = 404) will be randomized to usual care enhanced with the provision of a pedometer and information about the health system's services for mood or weight management (control) or with the Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight (I-CARE) program (intervention). The 12-month I-CARE program synergistically integrates two proven behavioral interventions: problem-solving therapy with as-needed intensification of pharmacotherapy for depression (PEARLS) and standardized behavioral treatment for obesity (Group Lifestyle Balance(™)). It utilizes traditional (e.g., office visits and phone consults) and emerging care delivery modalities (e.g., patient web portal and mobile applications). Follow-up assessments will occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. We hypothesize that compared with controls, I-CARE participants will have greater improvements in weight and depression severity measured by the 20-item Depression Symptom Checklist at 12 months, which will be sustained at 24 months. We will also assess I-CARE's cost-effectiveness and use mixed methods to examine its potential for reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This study offers the potential to change how obese and depressed adults are treated-through a new model of accessible and integrative lifestyle medicine and mental health expertise-in primary care."

Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that digital interventions can be effective in treating chronic pain. This study aimed to establish the clinical effectiveness of a web-based pain management programme (PMP), specifically whether it would lead to improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care costs in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS: Of 738 participants, 438 engaged with the programme and 300 did not. Two analyses were conducted: a within-subjects pre-post comparison of clinical outcomes for participants who completed the programme and a between-groups comparison of health care usage for those who engaged and those who did not. RESULTS: Participants who completed the programme made significant improvements with regard to their perceived health status, level of disability, mood, confidence managing pain, problems in life due to pain and level of pain. Around one-third of participants made reliable changes in their levels of disability, depression and anxiety. There was no relationship between gender or age and engagement with the programme. Those who engaged with the programme demonstrated reduced health care costs in the year following referral, whereas health care costs of non-engagers increased. Limitations of the study include a high drop-out rate and a non-randomised comparison group. Results must therefore be interpreted with some caution. CONCLUSION: A web-based pain management programme can be clinically effective and may be a useful addition to the treatments offered by pain management services."

Very little is known about the benefit of internet-based and mobile-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (IM-CBT) on physical outcomes and its reciprocal interactions with psychiatric outcomes, the active therapeutic elements, and effect moderators among people with major chronic medical conditions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42022265738), CINAHL of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science are systematically searched up to 1 June 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IM-CBT against non-CBT control condition(s) among people with chronic disease(s). Primary outcomes include improvements in psychiatric symptoms (depressive, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, general psychological distress) from baseline to post-intervention and follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include improvements in physical distress (physical symptoms, functional impairment, self-rated ill health, objective physiological dysfunction). Among 44 RCTs (5077 patients with seven different chronic diseases), IM-CBT improves depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and general psychological distress at post-intervention and across follow-ups, and improves physical distress and functional impairment at post-intervention. Preliminary evidence suggests that behavioral modification and problem-solving could be necessary components to reduce psychiatric symptoms in IM-CBT, whereas cognitive restructuring, psychoeducation, and mindfulness elements relate to reduced physical distress. IM-CBT shows stronger benefits in chronic pain, cancer, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease, relative to other conditions. Changes in psychiatric symptoms and physical distress prospectively predict each other over time. IM-CBT is an effective intervention for comprehensive symptom management among people with chronic diseases."

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies (ICBTs), developed to increase treatment access, show promise in reducing depression. The inclusion of coach support in treatment is desired and may be needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an ICBT protocol blended with weekly real-time therapist sessions via chat; blended treatment, for adolescent depression, including major depressive episode (MDE). The protocol has previously been evaluated in a controlled study. METHODS: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, adolescents 15 to 19 years of age were recruited through a community setting at the national level in Sweden (n=70) and allocated to either 8 weeks of treatment or to minimal attention control. Depression was assessed at baseline, at posttreatment, and at 12 months following treatment (in the intervention group). The primary outcome was self-reported depression level as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory II at posttreatment. The intervention was offered without the need for parental consent. RESULTS: Over two weeks, 162 adolescents registered and completed the baseline screening. Eligible participants (n=70) were on average 17.5 years of age (SD 1.15), female (96%, 67/70), suffered from MDE (76%, 53/70), had no previous treatment experience (64%, 45/70), and reported guardian(s) to be aware about their depression state (71%, 50/70). The average intervention completion was 74% (11.8 of 16 modules and sessions). Following the treatment, ICBT participants demonstrated a significant decrease in depression symptoms compared with controls (P<.001), corresponding to a large between-group effect (intention-to-treat analysis: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.37-1.35; of completer analysis: d=0.99, 95% CI 0.48-1.51). A significant between-group effect was observed in the secondary depression outcome (P=.003); clinically significant improvement was found in 46% (16/35) of ICBT participants compared with 11% (4/35) in the control group (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results are in line with our previous study, further demonstrating that adolescents with depression can successfully be engaged in and experience significant improvement following ICBT blended with therapist chat sessions. Findings on participants' age and baseline depression severity are of interest in relation to used study methods.

10.2147/JPR.S35199,Lifestyle-oriented non-pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia: a clinical overview and applications with home-based technologies,"Friedberg F, Williams DA, Collinge W.",J Pain Res,2012,2012.11.21,,,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a persistent and disabling widespread pain condition often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and headache. To date, the most thoroughly studied non-pharmacological approaches to managing FM are those with a focus on changing patient activities and beliefs that affect the illness. These interventions are intended to facilitate enduring improvement in pain and functional status. Lifestyle-oriented treatments include patient education, aerobic or other physical exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These interventions in FM can be delivered in medical or behavioral health care settings by trained professionals, through patient-oriented treatment manuals, or via remote-access technologies. Non-pharmacological treatments, in particular exercise and CBT, have yielded effect sizes and cost-benefit ratios comparable to medications. This paper describes lifestyle-oriented non-pharmacological treatments for FM and highlights selected literature reviews of these interventions. In addition, behavioral and practical issues are addressed that may affect these non-pharmacological treatments, including patient expectations, participant burden, and treatment availability. Recommendations are made to facilitate these interventions and potentially improve outcomes. In particular, the increasing availability of convenient home-based mobile technologies to deliver these non-pharmacological treatments is described."

Depression in children and adolescents affects their physical and mental development. Psychotherapy is considered to be one of the main treatment options for depressed children and adolescents. However, our understanding of the global performance and progress of psychological interventions for depression in children and adolescents (PIDCA) research is limited. AIM: To identify collaborative research networks in this field and explore the current research status and hotspots through bibliometrics. METHODS: Articles and reviews related to PIDCA from January 2010 to April 2023 were identified from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The Charticulator website, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to visualize the trends in publications and citations, the collaborative research networks (countries, institutions, and authors), and the current research status and hotspots. RESULTS: Until April 16, 2023, 1482 publications were identified. The number of documents published each year and citations had increased rapidly in this field. The United States had the highest productivity in this field. The most prolific institution was the University of London. Pim Cuijpers was the most prolific author. In the context of research related to PIDCA, both reference co-citation analysis and keywords co-occurrence analysis identified 10 research hotspots, including third-wave cognitive behavior therapy, short-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy, family element in psychotherapy, modular treatment, mobile-health, emotion-regulation-based transdiagnostic intervention program, dementia risk in later life, predictors of the efficacy of psychological intervention, and risks of psychological intervention. CONCLUSION: This bibliometric study provides a comprehensive overview of PIDCA from 2010 to present. Psychological intervention characterized as psychological-process-focused, short, family-involved, modular, internet-based, emotion-regulation-based, and personalized may benefit more young people."
10.1037/a0025499,Text Messaging as an Adjunct to CBT in Low-Income Populations: A Usability and Feasibility Pilot Study,"Aguilera A, Muñoz RF.",Prof Psychol Res Pr,2011,2014.12.20,,,"This article outlines the development and usability-feasibility testing of an automated text-messaging adjunct to cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression in a public sector clinic serving low-income patients. The text-messaging adjunct is aimed at increasing homework adherence, improving self-awareness, and helping track patient progress. Daily text messages were sent to patients, inquiring about their mood. Additional daily messages corresponded to themes of a manualized group CBT intervention. These included (1) thought tracking (both positive and negative), (2) tracking of pleasant activities, (3) tracking of positive and negative contacts, and (4) tracking of physical well-being. We tested the adjunct in 2 CBT groups (1 English & 1 Spanish) consisting of 12 patients total during and after treatment. Participants responded at a rate of 65% to text messages, and they reported overall positive experiences. We propose that text messaging has the potential to improve mental health care broadly, and among low-income populations specifically, with cost-effective means."

METHODS: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase up to June 2013 and identified additional studies through cross-references in included studies and systematic reviews. Twelve studies comprising 1721 patients met our inclusion criteria. The studies had sufficient statistical power to detect small effect sizes. RESULTS: CBT/MI proved effective for treating subclinical and clinical AUD and MDD compared with controls, with small overall effect sizes at post-treatment [g=0.17, confidence interval (CI)=0.07-0.28, P<0.001 for decrease of alcohol consumption and g=0.27, CI: 0.13-0.41, P<0.001 for decrease of symptoms of depression, respectively]. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences for both AUD and MDD. However, digital interventions showed a higher effect size for depression than face-to-face interventions (g= 0.73 and g=0.23, respectively, P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Combined cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing for clinical or subclinical depressive and alcohol use disorders has a small but clinically significant effect in treatment outcomes compared with treatment as usual."

10.2196/18723,Blended Care-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety in Real-World Settings: Pragmatic Retrospective Study,"Lungu A, Jun JJ, Azarmanesh O, Leykin Y, Chen CE.",J Med Internet Res,2020,2020.7.7,,,"BACKGROUND: The past few decades saw considerable advances in research and dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapies, yet available treatment resources are not able to meet the high need for care for individuals suffering from depression or anxiety. Blended care psychotherapy, which combines the strengths of therapist-led and internet interventions, can narrow this gap and be clinically effective and efficient, but has rarely been evaluated outside of controlled research settings. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a blended care intervention (video-based cognitive behavior therapy and internet intervention) under real-world conditions. METHODS: This is a pragmatic retrospective cohort analysis of 385 participants with clinical range depression and/or anxiety symptoms at baseline, measured using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), who enrolled in blended care psychotherapy treatment. Participants resided in the United States and had access to the blended care intervention as a mental health benefit offered through their employers. Levels of depression and anxiety were tracked throughout treatment. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the change in symptoms over time. The effects of age, gender, and providers on participants' symptom change trajectories were also evaluated. Paired sample t-tests were also conducted, and rates of positive clinical change and clinically significant improvement were calculated. RESULTS: The average depression and anxiety symptoms at 6 weeks after the start of treatment were 5.94 and 6.57, respectively. There were significant linear effects of time on both symptoms of depression and anxiety (β=-.49, P<.001 and β=-.64, P<.001). The quadratic effect was also significant for both symptoms of depression and anxiety (β=.04, P<.001 for both), suggesting a decelerated decrease in symptoms over time. Approximately 73% (n=283) of all 385 participants demonstrated reliable improvement, and 83% (n=319) recovered on either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 measures. Large effect sizes were observed on both symptoms of depression (Cohen d=1.08) and of anxiety (d=1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Video blended care cognitive behavioral therapy interventions can be effective and efficient in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety in real-world conditions. Future research should investigate the differential and interactive contribution of the therapist-led and digital components of care to patient outcomes to optimize care."
10.2196/66715,Effectiveness of Video Teletherapy in Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Children and Adolescents With Exposure and Response Prevention: Retrospective Longitudinal Observational Study,"Feusner JD, Farrell NR, Nunez M, Lume N, MacDonald CW, McGrath PB, Trusky L, Smith S, Rhode A.",J Med Internet Res,2025,2025.1.27,,,"BACKGROUND: An effective primary treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents as well as adults is exposure and response prevention (ERP), a form of intervention in the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Despite strong evidence supporting the efficacy and effectiveness of ERP from studies in research and real-world settings, its clinical use remains limited. This underuse is often attributed to access barriers such as the scarcity of properly trained therapists, geographical constraints, and costs. Some of these barriers may be addressed with virtual behavioral health, providing ERP for OCD through video teletherapy and supplemented by app-based therapeutic tools and messaging support between sessions. Studies of teletherapy ERP in adults with OCD have shown benefits in research and real-world settings in both small and large samples. However, studies of teletherapy ERP in children and adolescents thus far have been in small samples and limited to research rather than real-world settings. OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the real-world effectiveness of teletherapy ERP for OCD in the largest sample (N=2173) of child and adolescent patients to date. METHODS: Children and adolescents with OCD were treated with live, face-to-face video teletherapy sessions, with parent or caregiver involvement, using ERP. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after 7-11 weeks, and after 13-17 weeks. Additionally, longitudinal assessments of OCD symptoms were performed at weeks 18-30, 31-42, and 43-54. We analyzed longitudinal outcomes of OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and stress using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Treatment resulted in a median 38.46% (IQR 12.50%-64.00%) decrease in OCD symptoms at 13-17 weeks, and 53.4% of youth met full response criteria at this point. Improvements were observed in all categories of starting symptom severity: mild (median 40.3%, IQR 8.5%-79.8%), moderate (median 38.4%, IQR 13.3%-63.6%), and severe (median 34.1%, IQR 6.6%-58.5%). In addition, there were significant reductions in the severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. The median amount of therapist involvement was 13 (IQR 10.0-16.0) appointments and 11.5 (IQR 9.0-15.0) hours. Further, symptom improvements were maintained or improved upon in the longitudinal assessment periods of weeks 18-30, 31-42, and 43-54. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that remote ERP treatment, assisted by technology, can effectively improve both core OCD and related depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in children and adolescents with OCD in a real-world setting. Notable outcomes were achieved in a relatively small amount of therapist time, demonstrating its efficiency. Demonstrating the usefulness of a delivery format that overcomes several traditional barriers to treatment, these findings have implications for widespread dissemination of accessible, evidence-based care for children and adolescents with OCD."
10.3390/jcm8081239,From Research to Practice: Ten Lessons in Delivering Digital Mental Health Services,"Titov N, Hadjistavropoulos HD, Nielssen O, Mohr DC, Andersson G, Dear BF.",J Clin Med,2019,2019.8.21,,,"There is a large body of research showing that psychological treatment can be effectively delivered via the internet, and Digital Mental Health Services (DMHS) are now delivering those interventions in routine care. However, not all attempts to translate these research outcomes into routine care have been successful. This paper draws on the experience of successful DMHS in Australia and Canada to describe ten lessons learned while establishing and delivering internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) and other mental health services as part of routine care. These lessons include learnings at four levels of analysis, including lessons learned working with (1) consumers, (2) therapists, (3) when operating DMHS, and (4) working within healthcare systems. Key themes include recognising that DMHS should provide not only treatment but also information and assessment services, that DMHS require robust systems for training and supervising therapists, that specialist skills are required to operate DMHS, and that the outcome data from DMHS can inform future mental health policy. We also confirm that operating such clinics is particularly challenging in the evolving funding, policy, and regulatory context, as well as increasing expectations from consumers about DMHS. Notwithstanding the difficulties of delivering DMHS, we conclude that the benefits of such services for the broader community significantly outweigh the challenges."

This study explored how help-seeking behaviors act as intermediaries between medication use, AR symptoms as measured by the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), and mental health outcomes, specifically anxiety and depressive symptoms, assessed through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). METHODS: This longitudinal study analyzed data from 1035 adults 18 years and older. Participants were recruited from 105 non-allergist primary care clinics across the United States using the QHSLab Digital Medicine platform between February 20, 2024, and January 18, 2025. Of the original sample, 891 participants completed the follow-up, yielding an attrition rate of approximately 14 %. Health-seeking behavior was defined as seeking professional assistance for emotional well-being, allergies, or neither. Baseline medication use for intranasal steroids, antihistamines, decongestants, and oral leukotriene blockers was recorded. Pearson correlations, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), chi-squared test (χ2 test), and regression analyses explored relationships between these factors and health score changes (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Patients who actively sought help for emotional well-being and allergic rhinitis exhibited the most significant improvements in symptom severity and mental health outcomes. Pearson correlation analyses revealed a significant negative association between dual-condition help-seeking and reductions in both SNOT-22 (r = -0.22, p < 0.01) and PHQ-GAD scores (r = -0.34, p < 0.01). Regression analysis confirmed that help-seeking behaviors (HSB) were significant predictors of symptom improvement, with individuals seeking assistance for both conditions showing notable reductions in SNOT-22 (β = -0.19, p < 0.05) and PHQ-GAD scores (β = -0.28, p < 0.01). Longitudinal analyses further demonstrated that consistent HSB engagement over six months led to a 23 % greater reduction in SNOT-22 scores (β = -0.21, p = 0.03) and a 31 % greater reduction in PHQ-GAD scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.01) compared to pharmacologic interventions alone. Sensitivity analyses reaffirmed these findings, and mindfulness meditation (β = 3.54, p < 0.001) and allergen immunotherapy (β = 5.60, p = 0.0185) were identified as additional predictors of mental health improvement. These results highlight integrated care's critical role in addressing physical and mental health conditions to optimize patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the importance of help-seeking behaviors in improving allergic rhinitis and mental health outcomes, highlighting the benefits of integrated care approaches. Patients who sought help for both conditions experienced the most significant symptom relief, reinforcing the need for multidisciplinary, patient-centered treatment. Expanding mental health screening within AR management, enhancing access to behavioral interventions, and leveraging digital health tools can optimize patient engagement and long-term outcomes. These findings advocate for a holistic shift in AR care, emphasizing integrating physical and mental health support to improve overall well-being."
10.1002/jclp.70004,Virtual Reality in Psychotherapy: A Three-Dimensional Framework to Navigate Immersive Clinical Applications,"Montesano A, Seinfeld S.",J Clin Psychol,2025,2025.6.8,,,"Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming an increasingly prominent tool in psychotherapy, offering immersive and personalized experiences that can enhance therapeutic processes. However, the diversity and complexity of VR-based interventions pose challenges for clinicians and researchers seeking to understand and apply this technology effectively. This article introduces a three-dimensional conceptual framework to support the analysis, classification, and design of VR interventions in psychotherapy. The framework is organized around three axes: Strategy (the therapeutic purpose of the VR experience: exposure, training, and exploration), Focus (the psychological domain being targeted: symptoms, attitudes, and identity/flourishing), and Perspective (the point of view or identity adopted within the virtual environment: self, other, witness, and multi-perspective). Drawing on five clinical case reports, including chronic pain, PTSD, social anxiety, depression, and psychosis, this In Session issue illustrates how VR can be harnessed across diverse therapeutic aims and models (cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, systemic therapy, and personal construct therapy) to foster therapeutic breakthroughs. By presenting both well-established and innovative uses of VR, this issue offers valuable insights into how virtual environments can extend the boundaries of psychotherapy and address complex psychological challenges in novel, impactful, and transformative ways."
10.2196/29280,Organizational Readiness for Implementing an Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention for Depression Across Community Mental Health Services in Albania and Kosovo: Directed Qualitative Content Analysis,"Doukani A, Cerga Pashoja A, Fanaj N, Qirjako G, Meksi A, Mustafa S, Vis C, Hug J.",JMIR Form Res,2021,2021.11.1,,,"BACKGROUND: The use of digital mental health programs such as internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) holds promise in increasing the quality and access of mental health services. However very little research has been conducted in understanding the feasibility of implementing iCBT in Eastern Europe. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to qualitatively assess organizational readiness for implementing iCBT for depression within community mental health centers (CMHCs) across Albania and Kosovo. METHODS: We used qualitative semistructured focus group discussions that were guided by Bryan Weiner's model of organizational readiness for implementing change. The questions broadly explored shared determination to implement change (change commitment) and shared belief in their collective capability to do so (change efficacy). Data were collected between November and December 2017. A range of health care professionals working in and in association with CMHCs were recruited from 3 CMHCs in Albania and 4 CMHCs in Kosovo, which were participating in a large multinational trial on the implementation of iCBT across 9 countries (Horizon 2020 ImpleMentAll project). Data were analyzed using a directed approach to qualitative content analysis, which used a combination of both inductive and deductive approaches. RESULTS: Six focus group discussions involving 69 mental health care professionals were conducted. Participants from Kosovo (36/69, 52%) and Albania (33/69, 48%) were mostly females (48/69, 70%) and nurses (26/69, 38%), with an average age of 41.3 years. A directed qualitative content analysis revealed several barriers and facilitators potentially affecting the implementation of digital CBT interventions for depression in community mental health settings. While commitment for change was high, change efficacy was limited owing to a range of situational factors. Barriers impacting ""change efficacy"" included lack of clinical fit for iCBT, high stigma affecting help-seeking behaviors, lack of human resources, poor technological infrastructure, and high caseload. Facilitators included having a high interest and capability in receiving training for iCBT. For ""change commitment,"" participants largely expressed welcoming innovation and that iCBT could increase access to treatments for geographically isolated people and reduce the stigma associated with mental health care. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, participants perceived iCBT positively in relation to promoting innovation in mental health care, increasing access to services, and reducing stigma. However, a range of barriers was also highlighted in relation to accessing the target treatment population, a culture of mental health stigma, underdeveloped information and communications technology infrastructure, and limited appropriately trained health care workforce, which reduce organizational readiness for implementing iCBT for depression. Such barriers may be addressed through (1) a public-facing campaign that addresses mental health stigma, (2) service-level adjustments that permit staff with the time, resources, and clinical supervision to deliver iCBT, and (3) establishment of a suitable clinical training curriculum for health care professionals.

10.1176/appi.focus.23021004,Improving Suicide Prevention Through Evidence-Based Strategies: A Systematic Review,"Mann JJ, Michel CA, Auerbach RP.",Focus (Am Psychiatr Publ),2023,2023.5.18,,,"OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to identify scalable evidence-based suicide prevention strategies. METHODS: A search of PubMed and Google Scholar identified 20,234 articles published between September 2005 and December 2019, of which 97 were randomized controlled trials with suicidal behavior or ideation as primary outcomes or epidemiological studies of limiting access to lethal means, using educational approaches, and the impact of antidepressant treatment. RESULTS: Training primary care physicians in depression recognition and treatment prevents suicide. Educating youths on depression and suicidal behavior, as well as active outreach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to identify high-risk patients are understudied. Means restriction, including of firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and testing in other nonpsychiatrist physician settings. Active follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide in several countries, but evaluating the benefit attributable to each component is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating newer approaches, such as electronic health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based screening methods, ketamine's potential benefit for preventing attempts, and passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change."

The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of prescribing laughter to inform a larger randomised controlled trial. Secondary objectives are to assess if a two-week laughter prescription improves subjective and objective sleep outcomes, wellbeing, and/or psychological health outcomes. TRIAL DESIGN: To assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial for laughter prescription in relation to sleep, psychological health, and wellbeing. Forty university students will be recruited and randomised to one of two conditions (control/experimental). METHODS: Wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries will be used to estimate sleep outcomes during a one-week baseline testing phase and across the two-week intervention. The experimental group will be shown how to record a Laughie (a 1-min recording of their joyful laughter on their smartphone) and prescribed to laugh with it three times daily for 14 days (the control group will only track sleep). All participants will complete the WHO (Five) Well-being Index, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale pre- and post-intervention. The CONSORT checklist, and the Feasibility, Reach-out, Acceptability, Maintenance, Efficacy, Implementation, and Tailorabilty (FRAME-IT) framework will guide intervention planning and evaluation.

BACKGROUND: 30% of patients with cancer meet insomnia diagnostic criteria and this can be detrimental to health outcomes. Insomnia disorder comprises a dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality characterized by difficulty initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, or early morning wakening without the ability to return to sleep, at least 3 nights per week, for at least 3 months, causing significant impairment or distress in areas of functioning. METHODS: We will recruit 308 women with a current or prior cancer diagnosis who are currently experiencing insomnia; defined as a score of 16 or less on the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI). Participants will be randomised to dCBT-I or SHE. dCBT-I will be delivered online via 6 sessions. SHE will be provided in an online format. Assessments of sleep and other related parameters, through validated questionnaires, will be taken at 12 and 24 weeks following intervention. Once 24 week assessments are completed, participants will crossover to the alternate arm (either SHE or dCBT-I) and undergo a final assessment at week 36. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the mean continuous change in SCI score in the intervention arm compared to the control arm at 24 weeks. Additionally, the proportion of women with an SCI > 16 at 24 weeks will be assessed. Secondary outcomes include fatigue, sleep related quality of life, depression, anxiety, and hot flush interference.

Primary care patients, however, still lack timely, sufficient access to psychotherapy treatment. Adapting PC-MHI collaborative care to improve uptake of evidence-based computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) may be a potential solution. Understanding primary care-based mental health clinician perspectives is crucial for facilitating adoption of cCBT as part of collaborative depression care. We examined PC-MHI mental health clinicians' perspectives on adapting collaborative care models to support cCBT for VA primary care patients. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with PC-MHI nurse care managers, licensed social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists in one VA health-care system. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using the constant comparative method, and analyzed for overarching themes. Although cCBT awareness and knowledge were not widespread, participants were highly accepting of enhancing PC-MHI models with cCBT for depression treatment. Participants supported cCBT delivery by a PC-MHI care manager or clinician and saw it as an additional tool to engage patients, particularly younger Veterans, in mental health treatment. They commented that current VA PC-MHI models did not facilitate, and had barriers to, use of online and mobile treatments. If effectively implemented, however, respondents thought it had potential to increase the number of patients they could treat. There is widespread interest in modernizing health systems. VA PC-MHI mental health clinicians appear open to adapting collaborative care to increase uptake of cCBT to improve psychotherapy access.

METHODS: The first part of this study involved 11 professional mental health practitioners giving feedback on the feasibility of the TEA; while the second part involved a mixed-method single-arm study with 32 participants recruited online, who went through the seven intervention sessions within 14 days. The questionnaires were collected before, after, 14 days after, and 30 days after intervention. Additionally, 10 participants were invited to semi-structured interviews regarding their suggestions. RESULTS: Practitioners thought that the TEA showed high professionalism (8.91/10) and is suitable for treating emotional symptoms (8.09/10). The generalized estimating equation model showed that the TEA significantly reduced participants' depressive and anxiety symptoms, while the effects of the intervention remained 30 days post intervention (Cohen's d > 1). Thematic analysis revealed three main themes about future improvement, including content improvement, interaction improvement, and bug-fixing. CONCLUSIONS: To address the current needs for digital mental health intervention programs to account for the insufficient availability of mental health services in China, the current study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of TEA, with the potential to address the urgent need for remote mental health services.

10.1371/journal.pone.0233876,Long-term effects of a three-component lifestyle intervention on emotional well-being in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"Jiskoot G, Dietz de Loos A, Beerthuizen A, Timman R, Busschbach J, Laven J.",PLoS One,2020,2020.6.2,,,"Many women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) report high depression rates. The relationship between PCOS and these high depression rates is unclear. Two-component lifestyle interventions have revealed short-term effects on depression scores in this group of women. In general, 3-component interventions including diet, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are more effective in the long-term to improve emotional well-being. This has not yet been studied in women with PCOS. This study examined the effect of 20 CBT lifestyle (LS) sessions combined with a healthy diet and physical therapy with or without 9 months additional feedback through Short Message Service (SMS) via mobile phone, compared to care as usual (CAU, involving advice to lose weight). In this secondary analysis, 155 women with PCOS and a BMI above 25 kg/m2 were eligible. Depression scores decreased significantly in the LS programme compared to CAU (P = 0.045). In both the LS programme without SMS (P = 0.036) and the LS programme with SMS (P = 0.011) depression scores decreased while no change was observed in CAU (P = 0.875). Self-esteem scores improved significantly in the LS programme compared to CAU (P = 0.027). No differences in body image scores were observed in LS participants compared to CAU (P = 0.087), although body image improved significantly in both the LS without SMS (P = 0.001) and with SMS (P = 0.008) study arms. We found no significant mediating role by androgens in the relationship between LS participants and emotional well-being. Only weight-loss mediated the relationship between LS and self-esteem. To conclude, a three-component lifestyle intervention programme with or without additional SMS resulted in significant improvements in depression and self-esteem compared to CAU, in women with PCOS, obesity, and a wish to achieve a pregnancy. Testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, insulin, HOMA-IR, and cortisol did not mediate this effect. Weight loss mediated the effects on self-esteem but not on depression and body-image. This suggests that lifestyle treatment independent of weight loss can reduce depression and body-image, but both lifestyle treatment and weight loss can improve self-esteem. Thus, a three-component lifestyle intervention based on CBT could prove successful in improving mood in women with PCOS who are overweight or obese and attempting to become pregnant."

METHOD: With the goal of creating effective, tolerable, and scalable interventions for the prevention of adolescent depression, we have fielded three randomized clinical trials, centered in health care delivery organizations that use a whole-of-society approach: (a) Path 2 Purpose (N = 664), comparing the Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral, Humanistic, and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT; B. W. Van Voorhees et al., 2015), guided digital health intervention to a synchronous mental health specialist-led group cognitive behavioral intervention, Coping with Depression Course-Adolescent; (b) PATHway (N = 400), examining the efficacy of the CATCH-IT components; and (c) Behavioral Health Stratified Treatment (N = 780), which examines the feasibility and potential benefit of a coordinated care, risk stratification, and intervention matching approach for adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities using both CATCH-IT (lower risk) and the Coping with Depression Course-Adolescent (higher risk). RESULTS: The study samples for all three trials include youth from traditionally underrepresented groups (71.8%) with some economic distress (47.6%). Intervention utilization was moderate across trials. Feedback from study teams reveals general barriers to implementation and challenges specific to the pandemic.

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1165899,"Innovative moments in low-intensity, telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression","Drüge M, Staeck R, Haller E, Seiler C, Rohner V, Watzke B.",Front Psychol,2023,2023.8.11,,,"BACKGROUND: Innovative moments (IMs), defined as moments in psychotherapy when patients' problematic patterns change toward more elaborated and adaptive patterns, have been shown to be associated with a clinical change in patients with depression. Thus, far IMs have been studied in face-to-face settings but not in telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (t-CBT). This study investigates whether IMs occur in t-CBT and examines the association between IMs and symptom improvement, and reconceptualization and symptom improvement. METHODS: The therapy transcripts of n = 10 patients with mild to moderate depression (range: 7-11 sessions, in total 94 sessions) undergoing t-CBT were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Symptom severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and IMs (levels and proportions) were assessed for each therapy session. Hierarchical linear models were used to test the prediction models. RESULTS: The rating of IMs was shown to be feasible and reliable using the Innovative Moments Coding System (IMCS) (84.04% agreement in words coded), which is indicative of the applicability of the concept of IMs in t-CBT. Only reconceptualization IMs were shown to have a predictive value for treatment success (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.01). DISCUSSION: The results should be interpreted with caution due to the exploratory nature of this study. Due to the telephone setting, it was necessary to adapt the IMCS. Nonetheless, the extent of IMs identified in the low-intensity t-CBT investigated was comparable to IMs in face-to-face therapy. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between IMs and treatment success as a change process, especially for low-intensity treatments."

The World Health Organization's Thinking Healthy Programme (WHO-THP) is an established 'task-shared' cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for perinatal depression. However, efforts to scale up are hampered by overburdened health systems struggling to maintain quality and fidelity. Here, to overcome these challenges, we coproduced with end users a technology-assisted digital version of the THP delivered by lived-experience peers (technology-assisted peer-delivered THP (THP-TAP)). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of THP-TAP compared to the established WHO-THP. A single-blind cluster-randomized controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with 70 village clusters randomly distributed to the two interventions. From June 2022 to May 2023, we recruited 980 women with perinatal depression registered with primary healthcare centers. The primary outcome was remission from the depressive episode at 3 months postnatal. On assessment of 846/980 (86.3%) participants at 3 months postnatal, the difference in the remission rate was 8.91% with the lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval being 4.25%, larger than the prespecified -10% noninferiority margin (Pnoninferiority < 0.0001). In settings where health systems are weak and overburdened, THP-TAP offers an effective and potentially scalable alternative to the delivery of psychosocial interventions.

To meet the overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, innovative approaches must be employed to significantly expand mental health care delivery capacity. Although it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtually and digitally delivering psychotherapy, which has been shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good method for addressing this growing demand. OBJECTIVE: This research protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using an online, digital, asynchronous care model to treat mental health issues that are started or aggravated by stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program that is tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material that provides an overview of behavioral skills and weekly homework. Participants (N=80) will receive personalized feedback from and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, which are to be completed by participants at baseline, week 5, and posttreatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity to consent; a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, with symptoms that started or worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability to speak and read English; and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received in June 2020. The recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (intervention group: n=35; control group: n=23). Data collection is expected to conclude by the end of 2020. Analyses (ie, linear regression analysis for continuous outcomes and binomial regression analysis for categorical outcomes) are expected to be completed by February 2021. CONCLUSIONS: If proven feasible, this care delivery method could increase care capacity by up to fourfold. The findings from this study can potentially influence clinical practices and policies and increase accessibility to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, without sacrificing the quality of care.

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) may be one way to support this population. This is especially the case for caregivers in countries with limited resources, but high demand for psychological services. OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the effects of a therapist-guided 8-week-long ICBT intervention for informal caregivers. METHODS: In total, 63 participants were recruited online and randomized either to the intervention or to the wait-list control group. The main study outcome was the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes included measures of caregiver depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life. RESULTS: Moderate between-group effect sizes were observed for the CBI measure, in favor of the intervention group, with a Cohen d=-0.70 for the intention-to-treat analysis. Analyses of the subscales of the CBI showed significant reductions on the subscales of Development and Physical Health. Moderate reductions were found for depression and anxiety scores as indicated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores. Large between-group effects were observed for reduction in stress and increase in quality of life as indicated by the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14), The Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Scale (BBQ), and The World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5). In addition, participants experienced little to no difficulty in using the program and were mostly satisfied with the intervention's platform and the choice of content. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first internet intervention study for informal caregivers in Lithuania. The results suggest that therapist-guided ICBT can be effective in reducing caregiver burden, anxiety, depression, stress, and improving quality of life.

10.2196/28093,Remotely Delivered Interventions to Support Women With Symptoms of Anxiety in Pregnancy: Mixed Methods Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Evans K, Rennick-Egglestone S, Cox S, Kuipers Y, Spiby H.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.2.15,,,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of anxiety are common in pregnancy, with severe symptoms associated with negative outcomes for women and babies. Low-level psychological therapy is recommended for women with mild to moderate anxiety, with the aim of preventing an escalation of symptoms and providing coping strategies. Remotely delivered interventions have been suggested to improve access to treatment and support and provide a cost-effective, flexible, and timely solution. OBJECTIVE: This study identifies and evaluates remotely delivered, digital, or web-based interventions to support women with symptoms of anxiety during pregnancy. METHODS: This mixed methods systematic review followed a convergent segregated approach to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data. The ACM Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Health Technology Assessment Library, IEEE Xplore, Joanna Briggs Institute, Maternity and Infant Care, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Social Science Citation Index were searched in October 2020. Quantitative or qualitative primary research that included pregnant women and evaluated remotely delivered interventions reporting measures of anxiety, fear, stress, distress, women's views, and opinions were included. RESULTS: Overall, 3 qualitative studies and 14 quantitative studies were included. Populations included a general antenatal population and pregnant women having anxiety and depression, fear of childbirth, insomnia, and preterm labor. Interventions included cognitive behavioral therapy, problem solving, mindfulness, and educational designs. Most interventions were delivered via web-based platforms, and 62% (8/13) included direct contact from trained therapists or coaches. A meta-analysis of the quantitative data found internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and facilitated interventions showed a beneficial effect in relation to the reduction of anxiety scores (standardized mean difference -0.49, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22; standardized mean difference -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22). Due to limitations in the amount of available data and study quality, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Synthesized findings found some evidence to suggest that interventions are more effective when women maintain regular participation which may be enhanced by providing regular contact with therapists or peer support, appropriate targeting of interventions involving components of relaxation and cognitive-based skills, and providing sufficient sessions to develop new skills without being too time consuming. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to suggest that women who are pregnant may benefit from remotely delivered interventions. Components of interventions that may improve the effectiveness and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions included providing web-based contact with a therapist, health care professional, or peer community. Women may be more motivated to complete interventions that are perceived as relevant or tailored to their needs. Remote interventions may also provide women with greater anonymity to help them feel more confident in disclosing their symptoms."

Studies indicate that technology facilitates the delivery of interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in the treatment of psychological disorders in adults, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic symptoms, and eating disorders. Fewer data exist for computer-based (stand-alone, self-help) and computer-assisted (in combination with face-to-face therapy, or therapist guided) programs for youth. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to summarize and critically review the literature evaluating the acceptability and efficacy of using technology with treatment and prevention programs for anxiety in young children and adolescents. The aim was to improve the understanding of what would be critical for future development of effective technology-based interventions. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of the literature through searches in 3 scientific electronic databases (PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and PubMed). We used keywords in various combinations: child or children, adolescent, preschool children, anxiety, intervention or treatment or program, smartphone applications or apps, online or Web-based tool, computer-based tool, internet-based tool, serious games, cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT, biofeedback, and mindfulness. For inclusion, articles had to (1) employ a technological therapeutic tool with or without the guidance of a therapist; (2) be specific for treatment or prevention of anxiety disorders in children or adolescents; (3) be published between 2000 and 2018; and (4) be published in English and in scientific peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: We identified and examined 197 articles deemed to be relevant. Of these, we excluded 164 because they did not satisfy 1 or more of the requirements. The final review comprised 19 programs. Published studies demonstrated promising results in reducing anxiety, especially relative to the application of cognitive behavioral therapy with technology. For those programs demonstrating efficacy, no difference was noted when compared with traditional interventions. Other approaches have been applied to technology-based interventions with inconclusive results. Most programs were developed to be used concurrently with traditional treatments and lacked long-term evaluation. Very little has been done in terms of prevention interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Future development of eHealth programs for anxiety management in children will have to address several unmet needs and overcome key challenges. Although developmental stages may limit the applicability to preschool children, prevention should start in early ages. Self-help formats and personalization are highly relevant for large-scale dissemination. Automated data collection should be built in for program evaluation and effectiveness assessment. And finally, a strategy to stimulate motivation to play and maintain high adherence should be carefully considered."
10.1186/s12889-021-12341-z,Effectiveness of online mindfulness interventions on medical students' mental health: a systematic review,"Yogeswaran V, El Morr C.",BMC Public Health,2021,2021.12.18,,,"BACKGROUND: Medical school typically presents students with a combination of academic and personal stressors that may lead to substandard mental health wellbeing. Meditation practices such as mindfulness facilitate a greater awareness of one's thoughts and feelings, thereby decreasing emotional reactivity. The use of mindfulness-based interventions delivered online has considerable potential in fostering self-care and helping medical students to handle mental health challenges. We examined the available evidence on the use of online mindfulness interventions in order to determine whether they are feasible and effective for improving medical students' mental health. METHODS: We performed a systematic review guided by PRISMA guidelines and utilised the following databases: ProQuest, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, IEEE Explore, Cochrane, and CINAHL. The key search terms used include mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, online, web, virtual, internet cyber, app, medical students, residency students, and residents. English-language articles published in the last ten years that described online interventions for medical students or residents were included in the review. RESULTS: Two studies describing the impact of online mindfulness interventions on medical students' mental health were identified. Research in this domain is nascent; available qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests benefits in self-compassion, perceived stress, cognitive skill use, mindfulness, creating coping mechanisms, and greater awareness of emotions and feelings. There was no evidence of the effectiveness of online mindfulness interventions on depression, anxiety and burnout. There was, however, general low program usage and participation tended to diminish near the conclusion of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence found in the systematic review exhibits the potential for online mindfulness interventions to be effective in addressing some mental health challenges of medical students. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of online mindfulness interventions for burnout, depression, and anxiety. Longitudinal studies with randomised controlled trials are required to generate stronger and robust evidence."

Alcohol dependence caused by alcohol addiction has become a widespread concern in society. As the brand-new medical and health model created by the modern biomedical technology revolution and the information technology revolution, mobile health has been used more and more widely in the field of medical health with the characteristics of convenience, rapidity and generalisability. With the general use of the social software WeChat, it is feasible to implement mobile health on the WeChat platform. AIM: We aimed to explore the clinical effect of WeChat platform used in the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the maintenance period of alcohol dependence and addiction. METHODS: Seventy alcohol-dependent patients in the withdrawal maintenance stage admitted into our hospital were randomly divided into the CBT on WeChat platform group (the experiment group, n=35) and the general clinical treatment using sertraline group (the control group, n=35) with block randomisation grouping. They were evaluated with the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-C) before the treatment, at the end of the fourth week, at the end of the eighth week and at the end of the twelfth week of treatment. In addition, Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were employed to evaluate the degree of anxiety and depression of the two groups. RESULTS: The SADQ-C, SAS and SDS scores of the two groups after treatment decreased markedly compared with those before treatments, and the differences were statistically significant. Between-group comparison: the SADQ-C scores of the experiment group at the end of the fourth, eighth and twelfth weeks were lower than those of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant, which indicated that the score reduction in the experiment group was larger than that in the control group. The SAS and SDS scores of the experiment group at these time points were not significantly different from those of the control group, which indicated that these two treatment methods were comparable in treating patients' anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: The CBT intervention using WeChat may improve the subjectively reported severity of alcohol dependence of patients who had completed detoxification. It is conducive to prevention of relapse, and is convenient for patients. It is worthy of clinical application and further study."

Because a majority of the interventions studied to date have been therapist-assisted to some degree, it remains unclear whether a therapeutic alliance can develop within the context of an Internet-delivered self-guided intervention with no therapist support, and whether this has consequences for program outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study reports findings of a secondary analysis of data from 90 participants with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety, and/or stress who used a fully automated mobile phone and Web-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention called ""myCompass"" in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Symptoms, functioning, and positive well-being were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Therapeutic alliance was measured at post-intervention using the Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM), and this was supplemented with qualitative data obtained from 16 participant interviews. Extent of participant engagement with the program was also assessed. RESULTS: Mean ratings on the ARM subscales were above the neutral midpoints, and the interviewees provided rich detail of a meaningful and collaborative therapeutic relationship with the myCompass program. Whereas scores on the ARM subscales did not correlate with treatment outcomes, participants' ratings of the quality of their emotional connection with the program correlated significantly and positively with program logins, frequency of self-monitoring, and number of treatment modules completed (r values between .32-.38, P≤.002). The alliance (ARM) subscales measuring perceived empowerment (r=.26, P=.02) and perceived freedom to self-disclose (r=.25, P=.04) also correlated significantly in a positive direction with self-monitoring frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and qualitative findings from this analysis showed that a positive therapeutic alliance can develop in the Internet environment in the absence of therapist support, and that components of the alliance may have implications for program usage. Further investigation of alliance features in the Internet environment and the consequences of these for treatment outcomes and user engagement is warranted.

The purpose of this paper was to examine the theorized differential impact of a cognitive behavioral intervention (Mothers and Babies Personalized; MB-P) on maternal distress and emotional regulation for those with ≥ 1 adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; vs no ACEs) from pregnancy to 3 months postpartum. METHODS: Between August 2019 and August 2021, eligible pregnant individuals aged ≥ 18 years, < 22 weeks' gestation, and English-speaking were recruited from 6 university-affiliated prenatal clinics. Participants (N = 100) were randomized to MB-P (n = 49) or control (n = 51). Analyzable data were collected for 95 participants. Analyses tested progression of change (slope) and at individual timepoints (panel analysis) for perinatal mental health outcomes. RESULTS: The majority of participants (n = 68, 71%) reported experiencing > 1 ACE (median = 1, range: 0-11). Participants demonstrated significant differential effects for depressive symptoms in absence of ACEs (standardized mean differences [SMD] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.13-1.51]) vs in presence of ACEs (SMD = 0.39; 95% CI = [-0.20 to 0.97]) and perceived stress in absence of ACEs (SMD = 0.92; 95% CI = [0.23-1.62]) vs in presence of ACEs (SMD = -0.05; 95% CI = [-0.63 to 0.53]). A panel analysis showed significantly reduced depressive symptoms postintervention and increased negative mood regulation at 3 months postpartum for individuals with ACEs. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support effectiveness of the MB-P intervention to reduce prenatal distress for all pregnant individuals. Preliminary exploration suggests the possibility that individuals with ACEs may benefit from enhanced trauma-informed content to optimize the effects of a perinatal intervention."

Although several forms of psychological interventions may be advocated or used, some may lack strong evidence of efficacy and some may not have been evaluated in mass infectious disease outbreaks. This paper reports a systematic review of published studies (PROSPERO CRD:42020182094. Registered: 24.04.2020) examining the types and effectiveness of psychological support interventions for the general population and healthcare workers exposed to mass infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) were identified through searches of electronic databases: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCO) and the Cochrane Library Database from inception to 06.05.2021 using an agreed search strategy. Studies were included if they assessed the effectiveness of interventions providing psychological support to the general population and / or healthcare workers exposed to mass infectious disease outbreaks. Studies were excluded if they focused on man-made or natural disasters or if they included armed forces, police, fire-fighters or coastguards. RESULTS: Twenty-two RCTs were included after screening. Various psychological interventions have been used: therapist-guided therapy (n = 1); online counselling (n = 1); 'Emotional Freedom Techniques' (n = 1); mobile phone apps (n = 2); brief crisis intervention (n = 1); psychological-behavioural intervention (n = 1); Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (n = 3); progressive muscle relaxation (n = 2); emotional-based directed drawing (n = 1); psycho-educational debriefing (n = 1); guided imagery (n = 1); Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) (n = 1); expressive writing (n = 2); tailored intervention for patients with a chronic medical conditions (n = 1); community health workers (n = 1); self-guided psychological intervention (n = 1), and a digital behaviour change intervention (n = 1). Meta-analyses showed that psychological interventions had a statistically significant benefit in managing depression (Standardised Mean Difference [SMD]: -0.40; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: - 0.76 to - 0.03), and anxiety (SMD: -0.72; 95% CI: - 1.03 to - 0.40). The effect on stress was equivocal (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI: - 0.19 to 0.51). The heterogeneity of studies, studies' high risk of bias, and the lack of available evidence means uncertainty remains. CONCLUSIONS: Further RCTs and intervention studies involving representative study populations are needed to inform the development of targeted and tailored psychological interventions for those exposed to mass infectious disease outbreaks."
10.2196/27642,Therapist-Assisted Web-Based Intervention for Prolonged Grief Disorder After Cancer Bereavement: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Kaiser J, Nagl M, Hoffmann R, Linde K, Kersting A.",JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022.2.8,,,"BACKGROUND: Bereavement due to cancer increases the risk of prolonged grief disorder. However, specialized treatment options for prolonged grief after a loss due to illness are still scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to extend previous findings by evaluating a web-based cognitive behavioral intervention with asynchronous therapist support, consisting of structured writing tasks adapted specifically for prolonged grief after cancer bereavement. METHODS: The intervention was evaluated in a purely web-based randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Open-access recruitment of participants was conducted on the web. Prolonged grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, somatization, sleep quality, and mental and physical health were assessed on the web via validated self-report measures. RESULTS: A total of 87 participants were randomized into the intervention group (IG; 44/87, 51%) or the waitlist control group (43/87, 49%). Of the participants, 7% (6/87) dropped out of the study (5/44, 11%, in the IG). Of the 39 completers in the IG, 37 (95%) completed all intervention tasks. The intervention reduced symptoms of prolonged grief (intention-to-treat: P<.001; η2=0.34; Cohen d=0.80) to a clinically significant extent. It had favorable effects on depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and overall mental health but not on somatization, sleep quality, or physical health. CONCLUSIONS: The web-based intervention for prolonged grief after cancer bereavement is effective in reducing symptoms of prolonged grief disorder and accompanying syndromes in a timely, easily realizable manner and addresses specific challenges of bereavement to illness. Considering web-based approaches in future mental health care policy and practice can reduce health care gaps for those who are bereaved to cancer.

10.1111/jocn.17753,"Comparative Efficacy of Non-Pharmacological Interventions on Anxiety, Depression, Sleep Disorder, and Quality of Life in Patients With Liver Transplantation: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis","Li M, Yu B, Yang H, He H, Gao R.",J Clin Nurs,2025,2025.4.10,,,"AIMS: To compare and rank the efficacy of different non-pharmacological interventions on anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and the quality of life in liver transplantation patients. BACKGROUND: In recent years, numerous non-pharmacological interventions have been developed to address anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and the quality of life in liver transplantation patients. However, it remains unclear which non-pharmacological intervention serves as the most effective and preferred approach. DESIGN: A systematic review and network meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: Relevant randomised controlled trials were extracted from eight electronic databases. A network meta-analysis was then performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of the non-pharmacological interventions for liver transplantation patients. The quality of the data was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We registered this study in PROSPERO, number CRD42023450346. RESULTS: A total of 25 randomised controlled trials were included. Spouse support education combined with mindfulness training, individualised psychological intervention, and cognitive behavioural therapy were found to be significantly effective for both anxiety and depression. The top three interventions against anxiety were spouse support education combined with mindfulness training, individualised psychological intervention, and exercise rehabilitation training. Meanwhile, individualised psychological intervention, spouse support education combined with mindfulness training, and cognitive behavioural therapy were the top-ranked three interventions for reducing depression. Sleep hygiene education was the most effective to improve sleep disorders. Continuous care based on a mobile medical platform emerged as the most effective intervention in improving the quality of life. CONCLUSION: Several non-pharmacological interventions appeared to be effective in treating anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and improving the quality of life among liver transplantation patients. More high-quality clinical trials should be incorporated in the future to investigate the reliability of existing findings. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to apply these promising non-pharmacological interventions during clinical care.

10.1017/gmh.2024.71,Digital mental health interventions for treating mental disorders in young people based in low-and middle-income countries: A systematic review of the literature,"Alagarajah J, Ceccolini D, Butler S.",Glob Ment Health (Camb),2024,2024.9.24,,,"Young people (YP) (between 10 and 24 years) are disproportionally vulnerable to developing and being affected by mental health conditions due to physical, social and emotional risk factors. YP in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have poorer access to, and quality of, mental health services compared to those in high-income countries. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been proposed as tools to address this burden of disease and reduce the global treatment gap in youth mental health outcomes. This study aimed to examine the evidence for DMHIs for treating mental disorders in YP based in LMICs. To do this, the author searched academic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science) for primary studies on DMHIs targeting YP in LMICs. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria were followed. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) framework. A narrative synthesis methodology was used to summarise and explain the findings. The authors identified 287 studies of which 7 were eligible in the final review. The authors found evidence of the effectiveness of multiple forms of DMHI (especially internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy) on anxiety and depression outcomes. Studies reported a lack of long-term benefits of treatment, high dropout rates, and did not include key geographical settings or data on cost-effectiveness. No studies were judged to be of high quality. This review highlights the available evidence showing that DMHIs can improve mental health outcomes for YP in LMICs, but due to the limited number of studies and lack of high-quality data, increased adoption and scaling up of digital interventions require more rigorous studies showing clinical effectiveness and ability to provide return on investment."

Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (ICBT-I) has the potential to help large numbers of people with sleep disorders. This study investigated the preliminary effects of an 8-week guided ICBT-I intervention within a routine stepped-care service. Fifty-six (N = 56) patients consented to participate. The primary outcome was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and secondary outcome measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), each administered at baseline and weekly thereafter. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that ICBT-I produced statistically significant pre- to post- reductions in symptoms of insomnia, yielding within-group effects of d = 0.82 suggesting a potential for improved outcomes. Similar improvements were seen across secondary outcomes, with small-to-medium post-treatment within-group effects observed: depression (d = 0.63), anxiety (d = 0.39), and functional impairment (d = 0.31). These findings are supportive of the intervention's potential effectiveness and speak to the importance of several implementation factors that could enhance the effects of the intervention. The results contribute to the growing evidence base for digital interventions designed to help those with sleep difficulties and will inform the design of a future controlled evaluation of ICBT-I under routine clinical settings."
10.1017/S0033291725000340,Capitalizing on natural language processing (NLP) to automate the evaluation of coach implementation fidelity in guided digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (GdCBT),"Zainal NH, Eckhardt R, Rackoff GN, Fitzsimmons-Craft EE, Rojas-Ashe E, Barr Taylor C, Funk B, Eisenberg D, Wilfley DE, Newman MG.",Psychol Med,2025,2025.4.2,,,"BACKGROUND: As the use of guided digitally-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (GdCBT) grows, pragmatic analytic tools are needed to evaluate coaches' implementation fidelity. AIMS: We evaluated how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods might automate the monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT delivered as part of a randomized controlled trial. METHOD: Coaches served as guides to 6-month GdCBT with 3,381 assigned users with or at risk for anxiety, depression, or eating disorders. CBT-trained and supervised human coders used a rubric to rate the implementation fidelity of 13,529 coach-to-user messages. NLP methods abstracted data from text-based coach-to-user messages, and 11 ML models predicting coach implementation fidelity were evaluated. RESULTS: Inter-rater agreement by human coders was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient = .980-.992). Coaches achieved behavioral targets at the start of the GdCBT and maintained strong fidelity throughout most subsequent messages. Coaches also avoided prohibited actions (e.g. reinforcing users' avoidance). Sentiment analyses generally indicated a higher frequency of coach-delivered positive than negative sentiment words and predicted coach implementation fidelity with acceptable performance metrics (e.g. area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 74.48%). The final best-performing ML algorithms that included a more comprehensive set of NLP features performed well (e.g. AUC = 76.06%). CONCLUSIONS: NLP and ML tools could help clinical supervisors automate monitoring of coaches' implementation fidelity to GdCBT. These tools could maximize allocation of scarce resources by reducing the personnel time needed to measure fidelity, potentially freeing up more time for high-quality clinical care."

However, despite recognised problems with uptake, there has been a lack of investigation into the barriers and facilitators of engagement. We aimed to systematically review and synthesise findings from qualitative studies of computerised therapies, in order to identify factors impacting on engagement. METHOD: Systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies of user experiences of computer delivered therapy for depression and/or anxiety. RESULTS: 8 studies were included in the review. All except one were of desktop based cognitive behavioural treatments. Black and minority ethnic and older participants were underrepresented, and only one study addressed users with a co-morbid physical health problem. Through synthesis, we identified two key overarching concepts, regarding the need for treatments to be sensitive to the individual, and the dialectal nature of user experience, with different degrees of support and anonymity experienced as both positive and negative. We propose that these factors can be conceptually understood as the 'non-specific' or 'common' factors of computerised therapy, analogous to but distinct from the common factors of traditional face-to-face therapies. CONCLUSION: Experience of computerised therapy could be improved through personalisation and sensitisation of content to individual users, recognising the need for users to experience a sense of 'self' in the treatment which is currently absent. Exploiting the common factors of computerised therapy, through enhancing perceived connection and collaboration, could offer a way of reconciling tensions due to the dialectal nature of user experience. Future research should explore whether the findings are generalisable to other patient groups, to other delivery formats (such as mobile technology) and other treatment modalities beyond cognitive behaviour therapy. The proposed model could aid the development of enhancements to current packages to improve uptake and support engagement."

METHODS: The sample was drawn from individuals who subscribed to the Text4Hope program, a cognitive behavioral therapy inspired text messaging service developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey link was sent to the subscribers to ascertain their relationship status and assess psychopathology using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data analysis was carried out using SPSS-26 for descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Within the first 6 weeks of the pandemic, 8267 of 44·992 subscribers responded to the online survey giving a response rate of 19.4%. Mean scores on the PSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 were highest among those who were single and lowest among those who were widowed.

The present study examined longitudinal relationships between strengths use and emotional disorder symptoms (anxiety, stress, and depression) during a randomized clinical trial of the Digital Unified Protocol, a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy. Participants (N = 120) completed assessments at four major time points during treatment and at 3-month follow-up. We specified three random-intercept cross-lagged panel model to capture within-person, bidirectional, time-lagged relationships between strengths use and anxiety, stress, and depression, respectively. Prospective increases in strengths use were associated with significant decreases in anxiety at all time points (β = -0.26 to -0.49), while prospective decreases in anxiety were associated with significant increases in strengths use at most time points (β = -0.25 to -0.36). Prospective increases in strengths use were associated with significant decreases in stress at most time points (β = -0.23 to -0.54), while prospective decreases in stress were associated with significant increases in strengths use at Week 4 (β = -0.21) and at follow-up (β = -0.41). Prospective increases in strengths use were associated with significant decreases in depression at Week 8 (β = -0.63) and at posttreatment (β = -0.67), while prospective decreases in depression were associated with significant increases in strengths use at most time points (β = -0.34 to -0.47).

Methods: This randomized controlled trial (IRCT20141115019957N2) was conducted on 45DD patients who were referred to the Rehabilitation Clinic of Iran University of Medical Sciences in 2017. The convenience sampling method was used to select the participants and then they were randomly allocated into three equal groups using RANDBETWEEN function in Excel. The first group received a combination of BFT&CBT and also standard-of-care therapy (SoCT). The second group was treated with BFT and SoCT, and the third group received only SoCT. The patients were assessed by digital rectal examination and the Short Form-36, Spielberger Anxiety, Beck Depression and Constipation Scoring System questionnaires before and after the treatment.The data were analyzed by SPSS-22, ANOVA, ANCOVA and Chi-Square tests. Results: Patients who received both CBT&BFT had significant improvement in symptoms of constipation, depression, and anxiety.Furthermore, BFT and CBT&BFT groups are valued equivalent only on the mental component of SF36 and the total SF36 questionnaire.

10.1080/16506073.2025.2465737,The relationship between perfectionism and treatment outcomes among people receiving internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy for Generalised Anxiety Disorder,"Tang S, Mahoney A, Dobinson K, Shiner CT.",Cogn Behav Ther,2025,2025.2.18,,,"Perfectionism is a transdiagnostic process associated with multiple mental health disorders. Perfectionism can moderate the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for depression, but it remains unclear whether perfectionism is associated with CBT outcomes for anxiety disorders. This study investigated the relationship between perfectionism, treatment outcomes and adherence for individuals seeking internet-based CBT (iCBT) for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD). A total of 1,904 adults from the general Australian community commenced an iCBT GAD program and completed measures of perfectionism, generalised anxiety, depression and psychological distress at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Regression analyses were used to examine relationships between baseline perfectionism, post-treatment symptom reductions and treatment completion. Baseline perfectionism was significantly associated with pre-treatment GAD symptom severity, but not treatment completion or reductions in GAD severity post-iCBT. Significant reductions in generalised anxiety symptom severity (Hedges' g = 1.32), depression symptoms (g = 0.97), distress (g = 1.34) and perfectionism (both striving and evaluative concerns, g = 0.49 and g = 0.37, respectively) were observed with treatment. These findings suggest that iCBT for GAD is effective in reducing perfectionism, despite not directly targeting this process. Given there was no significant relationship between baseline perfectionism and treatment outcomes, it may not be necessary to specifically target perfectionism when delivering iCBT for GAD."

This study evaluated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a six-week internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (ICBT-I) in adolescents. METHODS: In this uncontrolled pilot study, participants (n = 27, 78% female) completed assessments pre- and post intervention. Data on recruitment, adherence to treatment, treatment activity, satisfaction and credibility was collected to assess feasibility. Self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep parameters as well as depression, anxiety and daytime function were also assessed. RESULTS: Participants showed good adherence to treatment and found the intervention overall credible and satisfactory. From pre- to post-assessment, statistically significant improvements were found for insomnia symptoms (p < .001; d = 1.02), sleep onset latency (p < .001; d = .39), wake after sleep onset (p = .001; d = .34), sleep efficiency (p < .001; d = .5) and depression (p = .01, d = .37). Changes in scores of total sleep time, generalized anxiety, daytime sleepiness and functional disability were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that ICBT-I is well accepted by adolescents, that insomnia symptoms and sleep parameters can improve following the intervention, and that co-morbid symptoms of depression can be reduced. Due to the limited sample size and the uncontrolled design, the suggested results need to be replicated in well-powered controlled clinical trials."

We asked: 1) Does sleep quality have an association with magnitude of incapability and pain intensity independent of mental health? and 2) Are mental health factors associated with sleep quality? METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of one hundred and fifty-four patients seeking musculoskeletal care who completed measures of magnitude of capability, pain intensity, unhelpful thoughts regarding symptoms (catastrophic thinking, negative pain thoughts), distress (symptoms of anxiety and depression), and sleep disturbance. We tested factors associated with the magnitude of capability and pain intensity, accounting for sleep quality and mental health in multivariable models. RESULTS: Accounting for potential confounding in multivariable analysis, lower magnitude of capability was independently associated with greater sleep disturbance, more unhelpful thoughts about symptoms (negative pain thoughts), and older age. Greater pain intensity was independently associated with greater unhelpful thoughts about symptoms (catastrophic thinking) and not using of an electronic device before bed. Greater sleep disturbance was independently associated with use of sleep medication, greater symptoms of anxiety, and greater unhelpful thoughts regarding symptoms (PCS). CONCLUSION: Given the observation that sleep disturbance is associated with feelings of anxiety, clinicians can consider starting mental health discussions by focusing on sleep quality. App and web-based cognitive behavioral therapy-based treatments for sleep are readily available and have the potential to improve mental health."
10.2196/12707,Unraveling the Black Box: Exploring Usage Patterns of a Blended Treatment for Depression in a Multicenter Study,"Kemmeren LL, van Schaik A, Smit JH, Ruwaard J, Rocha A, Henriques M, Ebert DD, Titzler I, Hazo JB, Dorsey M, Zukowska K, Riper H.",JMIR Ment Health,2019,2019.7.26,,,"BACKGROUND: Blended treatments, combining digital components with face-to-face (FTF) therapy, are starting to find their way into mental health care. Knowledge on how blended treatments should be set up is, however, still limited. To further explore and optimize blended treatment protocols, it is important to obtain a full picture of what actually happens during treatments when applied in routine mental health care. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to gain insight into the usage of the different components of a blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) for depression and reflect on actual engagement as compared with intended application, compare bCBT usage between primary and specialized care, and explore different usage patterns. METHODS: Data used were collected from participants of the European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Internet-Based Depression Treatment project, a European multisite randomized controlled trial comparing bCBT with regular care for depression. Patients were recruited in primary and specialized routine mental health care settings between February 2015 and December 2017. Analyses were performed on the group of participants allocated to the bCBT condition who made use of the Moodbuster platform and for whom data from all blended components were available (n=200). Included patients were from Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, and France; 64.5% (129/200) were female and the average age was 42 years (range 18-74 years). RESULTS: Overall, there was a large variability in the usage of the blended treatment. A clear distinction between care settings was observed, with longer treatment duration and more FTF sessions in specialized care and a more active and intensive usage of the Web-based component by the patients in primary care. Of the patients who started the bCBT, 89.5% (179/200) also continued with this treatment format. Treatment preference, educational level, and the number of comorbid disorders were associated with bCBT engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Blended treatments can be applied to a group of patients being treated for depression in routine mental health care. Rather than striving for an optimal blend, a more personalized blended care approach seems to be the most suitable. The next step is to gain more insight into the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended treatments and to further facilitate uptake in routine mental health care."
10.2196/50399,"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Potential Efficacy of a Self-Guided Internet-Delivered Dialectical Behavior Therapy Intervention for Substance Use Disorders: Randomized Controlled Trial","Daros AR, Guimond TH, Yager C, Palermo EH, Wilks CR, Quilty LC.",JMIR Ment Health,2024,2024.1.16,,,"BACKGROUND: People with alcohol and substance use disorders (SUDs) often have underlying difficulties in regulating emotions. Although dialectical behavioral therapy is effective for SUDs, it is often difficult to access. Self-guided, internet-delivered dialectical behavioral therapy (iDBT) allows for expanded availability, but few studies have rigorously evaluated it in individuals with SUDs. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of an iDBT intervention in treatment-seeking adults with SUDs. We hypothesized that iDBT would be feasible, credible, acceptable, and engaging to people with SUDs. We also hypothesized that the immediate versus delayed iDBT group would show comparatively greater improvements and that both groups would show significant improvements over time. METHODS: A 12-week, single-blinded, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial was implemented, with assessments at baseline and at 4 (acute), 8, and 12 weeks (follow-up). A total of 72 community adults aged 18 to 64 years were randomized. The immediate group (n=38) received access to iDBT at baseline, and the delayed group (n=34) received access after 4 weeks. The intervention (Pocket Skills 2.0) was a self-guided iDBT via a website, with immediate access to all content, additional text and email reminders, and additional support meetings as requested. Our primary outcome was substance dependence, with secondary outcomes pertaining to feasibility, clinical outcomes, functional disability, and emotion dysregulation, among other measures. All outcomes were assessed using self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: iDBT was perceived as a credible and acceptable treatment. In terms of feasibility, 94% (68/72) of the participants started iDBT, 13% (9/68) were early dropouts, 35% (24/68) used it for the recommended 8 days in the first month, and 50% (34/68) were still active 4 weeks later. On average, the participants used iDBT for 2 hours and 24 minutes across 10 separate days. In the acute period, no greater benefit was found for the immediate group on substance dependence, although we did find lower depression (b=-2.46; P=.02) and anxiety (b=-2.22; P=.02). At follow-up, there were greater benefits in terms of reduced alcohol (b=-2.00; P=.02) and nonalcoholic substance (b=-3.74; P=.01) consumption in the immediate access group. Both groups demonstrated improvements in substance dependence in the acute (b=-1.73; P<.001) and follow-up period (b=-2.09; P<.001). At follow-up, both groups reported reduced depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, emotional dysregulation, and functional disability. CONCLUSIONS: iDBT is a feasible and acceptable intervention for patients with SUDs, although methods for improving engagement are warranted. Although results did not support efficacy for the primary outcome at 4 weeks, findings support reductions in substance dependence and other mental health concerns at 12 weeks. Notwithstanding the limitations of this study, the results suggest the potential value of iDBT in the treatment of SUDs and other mental health conditions.

This scoping review provides an update on remote patient monitoring for neuropsychiatric disorders from recent publications and upcoming clinical trials. Methods: Publications (PubMed and ICHUSHI; published January 2010 to February 2021) and trials (ClinicalTrials.gov and Japanese registries; active or recruiting by March 2021) that assessed wearable devices for remote management and/or monitoring of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders were searched. The review focuses on disorders with ≥3 publications. Results: We identified 44 publications and 51 active or recruiting trials, mostly from 2019 or 2020. Research on digital devices was most common for Parkinson's disease (11 publications and 19 trials), primarily for monitoring motor symptoms and/or preventing falls. Other disorders (3-5 publications each) included epilepsy (electroencephalogram [EEG] and seizure prediction), sleep disorder (sleep outcomes and behavioral therapies), multiple sclerosis (physical activity and symptoms), depression (physical activity, symptoms, and behavioral therapies), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (symptoms). Very few studies focused on newly emerging technologies (e.g., in-ear EEG and portable oximeters), and few studies integrated remote symptom monitoring with telemedicine. Discussion: Currently, development of digital devices for daily symptom monitoring is focused on Parkinson's disease. For the diseases reviewed, studies mostly focused on physical activity rather than psychiatric or nonmotor symptoms. Although the validity and usefulness of many devices are established, models for implementing remote patient monitoring in telehealth settings have not been established. Conclusions: Verification of the clinical effectiveness of digital devices combined with telemedicine is needed to further advance remote patient care for neuropsychiatric disorders."

Telerehabilitation has shown great potential in mitigating musculoskeletal pain conditions, but EP is less explored. This single-arm interventional study investigates clinical outcomes and engagement levels of a completely remote multimodal digital care program (DCP) in patients with EP. The DCP consisted of exercise, education, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for 8 weeks. Primary outcome: disability change (through the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), treatment response cut-offs: 12.0-point reduction and 30% change). Secondary outcomes: pain, analgesic intake, surgery intent, mental health, fear-avoidance beliefs, work productivity, and patient engagement. Of the 132 individuals that started the DCP, 112 (84.8%) completed the intervention. Significant improvements were observed in QuickDASH with an average reduction of 48.7% (11.9, 95% CI 9.8; 14.0), with 75.3% of participants reporting ≥30% change and 47.7% reporting ≥12.0 points. Disability change was accompanied by reductions in pain (53.1%), surgery intent (57.5%), anxiety (59.8%), depression (68.9%), fear-avoidance beliefs (34.2%), and productivity impairment (72.3%). Engagement (3.5 (SD 1.4) sessions per week) and satisfaction 8.5/10 (SD 1.6) were high. The significant improvement observed in clinical outcomes, alongside high engagement, and satisfaction suggests patient acceptance of this care delivery mode."
10.1038/s41598-024-53119-8,Mobile cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: analysis of factors affecting treatment prognosis,"Wei J, Xu Y, Mao H.",Sci Rep,2024,2024.2.6,,,"Erratum in Sci Rep. 2024 Apr 3;14(1):7855. doi: 10.1038/s41598-024-58107-6. This study aims to explore the factors that affect the prognosis of patients with insomnia who are treated with mobile cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients with insomnia who visited the sleep disorders clinic were selected and completed mobile Cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients completed at least three evaluations (including baseline, monthly evaluations thereafter, and a final evaluation at the end of one year) and responded well to treatment within one year of follow-up. Insomnia, anxiety, and depression symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Treatment prognosis including relapse, recurrence, and remission group. These 339 patients were divided into three groups: 160 patients who remission, 100 patients who relapsed, and 79 patients who experienced recurrence after remission. Demographic characteristics of the 339 patients showed no significant difference in gender between the three groups (P = 0.978). However, significant differences were found in age (P = 0.006) and onset time (P = 0.000) among the three groups. The remission group had a higher average age than the recurrence group and the relapse group, and the onset time was slower than the other two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age and delayed onset time were protective factors for good treatment prognosis, while low educational level and high GAD-7 scores were independent risk factors for poor prognosis. There are many factors that affect the treatment prognosis of insomnia. Age, low educational level, high GAD-7 scores, and delayed onset time can be used to predict the prognosis of insomnia treatment."

Cognitive-behavioral therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia but is rarely available to cancer survivors. We tested the effectiveness of a web-based CBT-I program, OncoSleep, in cancer survivors. METHODS: Cancer survivors with insomnia (n = 154) were randomly assigned (1:1) to digital CBT-I (6 weekly self-guided modules plus online clinician support) or a waitlist control group. Patient-reported outcome measures of insomnia severity (primary outcome), daytime functioning, and sleep diaries were administered online at baseline and post-treatment (8 weeks). Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using mixed-effects models. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The treatment group reported an average 11.0-point reduction in the Insomnia Severity index (ISI), compared to a 1.4-point reduction in the control group (p<.001). Statistically significant group-by-time interactions were observed: web-based CBT-I produced significant, large effects for improvements in insomnia severity (d = -2.56), cognitive functioning (d = 0.95), physical (d = 1.24) and psychological quality of life (d = 0.80), and fatigue (d = -1.35). Small-to-large effect sizes were found for reductions in anxiety (d = -0.77), depression (d = -0.71), and pain (d = -0.40). Change in insomnia severity mediated the effect of digital CBT-I on daytime outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based CBT-I with clinician support appears to be an effective treatment for insomnia in cancer survivors, offering meaningful benefits for comorbid symptoms and quality of life. Further studies with active comparisons and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these findings. Digital CBT-I could be integrated into cancer rehabilitation programs to reduce the burden of insomnia. [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04898855]."
10.2196/59699,Impact of an Online Discussion Forum on Self-Guided Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Public Safety Personnel: Randomized Trial,"McCall HC, Hadjistavropoulos HD.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.8.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is an effective and accessible treatment for various mental health concerns. ICBT has shown promising treatment outcomes among public safety personnel (PSP), who experience high rates of mental health problems and face barriers to accessing other mental health services. Client engagement and clinical outcomes are better in ICBT with therapist guidance, but ICBT is easier to implement on a large scale when it is self-guided. Therefore, it is important to identify strategies to improve outcomes and engagement in self-guided ICBT and other self-guided digital mental health interventions. One such strategy is the use of online discussion forums to provide ICBT clients with opportunities for mutual social support. Self-guided interventions accompanied by online discussion forums have shown excellent treatment outcomes, but there is a need for research experimentally testing the impact of online discussion forums in ICBT. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate a transdiagnostic, self-guided ICBT intervention tailored specifically for PSP (which had not previously been assessed), assess the impact of adding a therapist-moderated online discussion forum on outcomes, and analyze participants' feedback to inform future research and implementation efforts. METHODS: In this randomized trial, we randomly assigned participating PSP (N=107) to access an 8-week transdiagnostic, self-guided ICBT course with or without a built-in online discussion forum. Enrollment and participation were entirely web-based. We assessed changes in depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress as well as several secondary outcome measures (eg, treatment engagement and satisfaction) using questionnaires at the pre-enrollment, 8-week postenrollment, and 20-week postenrollment time points. Mixed methods analyses included multilevel modeling and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants engaged minimally with the forum, creating 9 posts. There were no differences in treatment outcomes between participants who were randomly assigned to access the forum (56/107, 52.3%) and those who were not (51/107, 47.7%). Across conditions, participants who reported clinically significant symptoms during enrollment showed large and statistically significant reductions in symptoms (P<.05 and d>0.97 in all cases). Participants also showed good treatment engagement and satisfaction, with 43% (46/107) of participants fully completing the intervention during the course of the study and 96% (79/82) indicating that the intervention was worth their time. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has shown excellent clinical outcomes for self-guided ICBT accompanied by discussion forums and good engagement with those forums. Although clinical outcomes in our study were excellent across conditions, engagement with the forum was poor, in contrast to previous research. We discuss several possible interpretations of this finding (eg, related to the population under study or the design of the forum). Our findings highlight a need for more research evaluating the impact of online discussion forums and other strategies for improving outcomes and engagement in self-guided ICBT and other digital mental health interventions.

There is a lack of mental health supports for this population, and internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) may be a useful resource to meet this need. The purpose of this study was to use a qualitative approach to explore the mental health needs of LEA patients and to gauge their attitudes of the use of iCBT to help them cope with their amputation. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with inpatients and outpatients with LEA recruited from a major urban rehabilitation hospital. Data were analysed using inductive codebook thematic analysis (TA). RESULTS: Ten interviews were completed with individuals with LEA. The main themes identified were: (1) Fixating on the past; (2) Worry about the future; (3) Unmet mental health needs; (4) Barriers to Mental Health Support; (5) Importance of peer support; and (6) Tailoring iCBT. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that patients with LEA are open to learning more about iCBT to meet their mental health needs. Key iCBT implementation considerations include taking into account issues of stigma associated with mental health, timing of delivery, levels of digital literacy, online security, and interactive content.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONFollowing lower extremity amputation (LEA), people experience significant emotional distress and are at risk for the development of anxiety and/or depression.Patients with LEA are receptive to an online mental health resource (i.e., internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy [iCBT]) but it needs to be tailored to meet the various mental health needs and digital literacy of the LEA population.The use of an implementation science approach can help identify factors related to the development and potential uptake of an iCBT for patients with LEA."
10.2196/46062,Understanding Users' Experiences of a Novel Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Platform for Depression and Anxiety: Qualitative Interviews From Pilot Trial Participants,"Shkel J, Green G, Le S, Kaveladze B, Marcotte V, Rushton K, Nguyen T, Schueller SM.",JMIR Form Res,2023,2023.6.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) can help bridge the gap between the demand for mental health care and availability of treatment resources. The affordances of DMHIs have been proposed to overcome barriers to care such as accessibility, cost, and stigma. Despite these proposals, most evaluations of the DMHI focus on clinical effectiveness, with less consideration of users' perspectives and experiences. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of ""Overcoming Thoughts,"" a web-based platform that uses cognitive and behavioral principles to address depression and anxiety. The ""Overcoming Thoughts"" platform included 2 brief interventions-cognitive restructuring and behavioral experimentation. Users accessed either a version that included asynchronous interactions with other users (""crowdsourced"" platform) or a completely self-guided version (control condition). We aimed to understand the users' perspectives and experiences by conducting a subset of interviews during the follow-up period of the trial. METHODS: We used purposive sampling to select a subset of trial participants based on group assignment (treatment and control) and symptom improvement (those who improved and those who did not on primary outcomes). We conducted semistructured interviews with 23 participants during the follow-up period that addressed acceptability, usability, and impact. We conducted a thematic analysis of the interviews until saturation was reached. RESULTS: A total of 8 major themes were identified: possible opportunities to expand the platform; improvements in mental health because of using the platform; increased self-reflection skills; platform being more helpful for certain situations or domains; implementation of skills into users' lives, even without direct platform use; increased coping skills because of using the platform; repetitiveness of platform exercises; and use pattern. Although no differences in themes were found among groups based on improvement status (all P values >.05, ranging from .12 to .86), there were 4 themes that differed based on conditions (P values from .01 to .046): helpfulness of self-reflection supported by an exercise summary (greater in control); aiding in slowing thoughts and feeling calmer (greater in control); overcoming patterns of avoidance (greater in control); and repetitiveness of content (greater in the intervention). CONCLUSIONS: We identified the different benefits that users perceived from a novel DMHI and opportunities to improve the platform. Interestingly, we did not note any differences in themes between those who improved and those who did not, but we did find some differences between those who received the control and intervention versions of the platform. Future research should continue to investigate users' experiences with DMHIs to better understand the complex dynamics of their use and outcomes."

Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) can reduce barriers to care to broad cross sections of the population. However, People of Diverse Ethnocultural Backgrounds (PDEGs) other than White/Caucasian underutilize mental health services and are under represented in clinical trials of psychological interventions. METHODS: To address this research gap we adapted an evidence-based ICBT program for PDEGs. The current pilot study explores the engagement, satisfaction, and effectiveness in the adapted ICBT program by PDEGs (N=41) when benchmarked against a sample of PDEGs (N=134) who previously completed a non-adapted version of the ICBT program. RESULTS: An intent-to-treat analyses showed that the adapted ICBT program is effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms among PDEGs. Large within-group pre-to post-treatment Cohen's effect sizes of d = 1.23, 95% CI [0.68, 1.77] and d = 1.24, 95% CI [0.69, 1.79] were found for depression and anxiety, respectively. Further, 81.8% of the PDEGs who received the adapted ICBT reported overall satisfaction, 90.9% reported increased confidence in managing symptoms, and 70.7% completed majority of the psychoeducational lessons in the ICBT program.

METHODS: The Defining the Impact of Sleep improvement on Cognitive Outcomes (DISCO) trial was an online, two-arm, single-blind, randomized clinical trial of dCBT versus wait-list control. Participants were aged 25 years and older, met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder, and reported difficulties with concentration or memory. Assessments were carried out online at baseline, and 10 and 24 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome measure was self-reported cognitive impairment, assessed with the British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI). Secondary outcomes included tests of cognitive performance, insomnia symptoms, cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Four hundred and ten participants with insomnia were recruited and assigned to dCBT (N = 205) or wait-list control (N = 205). At 10 weeks post-randomization the estimated adjusted mean difference for the BC-CCI was -3.03 (95% CI: -3.60, -2.47; p < 0.0001, d = -0.86), indicating that participants in the dCBT group reported less cognitive impairment than the control group. These effects were maintained at 24 weeks (d = -0.96) and were mediated, in part, via reductions in insomnia severity and increased sleep efficiency. Treatment effects in favor of dCBT, at both 10 and 24 weeks, were found for insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, cognitive failures, fatigue, sleepiness, depression, and anxiety. We found no between-group differences in objective tests of cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that dCBT robustly decreases self-reported cognitive impairment at post-treatment and these effects are maintained at 6 months."

Monitoring and obtaining early client feedback can allow for rapidly adapted treatment delivery and improve outcomes. This study seeks to develop a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework for predicting clinical outcomes in internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) by leveraging large-scale, high-dimensional time-series data of client-reported mental health symptoms and platform interaction data. We use de-identified data from 45,876 clients on SilverCloud Health, a digital platform for the psychological treatment of depression and anxiety. We train deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models to predict whether a client will show reliable improvement by the end of treatment using clinical measures, interaction data with the iCBT program, or both. Outcomes are based on total improvement in symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD-7), as reported within the iCBT program. Using internal and external datasets, we compare the proposed models against several benchmarks and rigorously evaluate them according to their predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUROC over treatment. Our proposed RNN models consistently predict reliable improvement in PHQ-9 and GAD-7, using past clinical measures alone, with above 87% accuracy and 0.89 AUROC after three or more review periods, outperforming all benchmark models. Additional evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the achieved models across (i) different health services; (ii) geographic locations; (iii) iCBT programs, and (iv) client severity subgroups. Results demonstrate the robust performance of dynamic prediction models that can yield clinically helpful prognostic information ready for implementation within iCBT systems to support timely decision-making and treatment adjustments by iCBT clinical supporters towards improved client outcomes."

Because insomnia and depression are highly prevalent and associated with FoP, we examined the association between FoP, insomnia, and depression in cancer patients. Furthermore, we tested the mediation effect of cancer-related dysfunctional beliefs about sleep (C-DBS) on this association. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from patients with surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer from a single-center randomized controlled study investigating digital healthcare applications. Baseline demographic and clinical variables were collected. In addition, self-reported questionnaires including the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form, Patients Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index, and C-DBS were administered. RESULTS: Among the 320 enrolled patients with lung cancer, a regression model showed that FoP was predicted by age (β = -0.13, P = 0.007), PHQ-9 (β = 0.35, P < 0.001), and C-DBS (β = 0.28, P < 0.001). Insomnia did not directly influence FoP, but C-DBS mediated the association. Depression directly influenced FoP, but C-DBS did not mediate this association. CONCLUSION: Among patients with surgically resected lung cancer, C-DBS mediated the effects of severity of insomnia on FoP. Depression directly influenced FoP, but C-DBS did not influence this association. To reduce FoP among patients with lung cancer, C-DBS should be addressed in the cognitive behavioral therapy module."

PARTICIPANTS: 40 children aged between 9 and 16 years affected by Tourette Syndrome. RESULTS: Online remote and face-to-face behavior therapy are equally effective in the treatment of tics and co-occurring disorders in children and adolescents affected by Tourette Syndrome. Both groups showed an improvement in the severity of tics, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, as assessed by neuropsychological findings. Online remote behavior therapy was more effective for reducing depressive symptoms than face-to-face behavior therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Online remote behavior therapy is a promising tool for behavioral therapies for patients with Tourette Syndrome and may represents an alternative treatment option."

STARS consisted of 10 lessons in which participants interacted with a chatbot and learned several cognitive behavioral therapy strategies, with optional guidance by a trained e-helper through 5 weekly phone calls. ECAU consisted of a static web page providing basic psychoeducation. Online questionnaires were administered at baseline (week 0) and postassessment (week 8) to assess depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 [HSCL-25]), anxiety (HSCL-25), functional impairment (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS] 2.0), psychological well-being (WHO-Five Well-Being Index [WHO-5]), and agency (State Hope Scale). Process evaluation interviews with stakeholders were conducted after the postassessment. RESULTS: Participants were recruited in December 2022 and January 2023. Of 700 screening website visits, 160 participants were eligible, and 60 participants (mean age 19.7, SD 1.16 years; 49/60, 82% female) continued to baseline and were randomized into STARS (n=30) or ECAU (n=30). Of those who received STARS, 37% (11/30) completed at least 8 chatbot lessons, and 13% (4/30) completed all 5 support calls. The research protocol functioned well in terms of balanced randomization, high retention at postassessment (48/60, 80%), and good psychometric properties of the online questionnaires. Process evaluation interviews with STARS participants, ECAU participants, e-helpers, and the clinical supervisor indicated the acceptability of the study procedures and the STARS and ECAU conditions and highlighted several aspects that could be improved, including the e-helper support and features of the STARS chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the STARS intervention and research procedures. A fully powered, definitive randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of STARS.

10.2196/resprot.4032,A mobile phone and web-based intervention for improving mental well-being in young people with type 1 diabetes: design of a randomized controlled trial,"Clarke J, Vatiliotis V, Verge CF, Holmes-Walker J, Campbell LV, Wilhelm K, Proudfoot J.",JMIR Res Protoc,2015,2015.5.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Young people with type 1 diabetes experience elevated levels of emotional distress that impact negatively on their diabetes self-care, quality of life, and disease-related morbidity and mortality. While the need is great and clinically significant, a range of structural (eg, service availability), psychological (eg, perceived stigma), and practical (eg, time and lifestyle) barriers mean that a majority of young people do not access the support they need to manage the emotional and behavioral challenges of type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a fully-automated cognitive behavior therapy-based mobile phone and Web-based psychotherapeutic intervention (myCompass) for reducing mental health symptoms and diabetes-related distress, and improving positive well-being in this vulnerable patient group. METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Young people with type 1 diabetes and at least mild psychological distress will be recruited via outpatient diabetes centers at three tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, and referred for screening to a study-specific website. Data will be collected entirely online. Participants randomized to the intervention group will use the myCompass intervention for 7 weeks, while at the same time a control group will use an active placebo program matched to the intervention on duration, mode of delivery, and interactivity. RESULTS: The primary outcome will be mental well-being (ie, depression, anxiety, diabetes-related distress, and positive well-being), for which data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and after 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be functional (work and social functioning and diabetes self-care), biochemical measures (HbA1c), and mental health self-efficacy. We aim to recruit 280 people into the study that will be conducted entirely online. Group differences will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed models repeated measures. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that scores on the outcome measures will improve significantly for young people who use the mobile phone and Web-based intervention compared to the control group. myCompass is a public health intervention that is broadly available and free to use. If effective, the program has the capacity to provide convenient and accessible evidenced-based care to the large group of young people with type 1 diabetes who do not currently access the psychosocial support they need.

10.2196/52118,Effectiveness of a Web-Based Individual Coping and Alcohol Intervention Program for Children of Parents With Alcohol Use Problems: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Wall H, Hansson H, Zetterlind U, Kvillemo P, Elgán TH.",J Med Internet Res,2024,2024.4.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Children whose parents have alcohol use problems are at an increased risk of several negative consequences, such as poor school performance, an earlier onset of substance use, and poor mental health. Many would benefit from support programs, but the figures reveal that only a small proportion is reached by existing support. Digital interventions can provide readily accessible support and potentially reach a large number of children. Research on digital interventions aimed at this target group is scarce. We have developed a novel digital therapist-assisted self-management intervention targeting adolescents whose parents had alcohol use problems. This program aims to strengthen coping behaviors, improve mental health, and decrease alcohol consumption in adolescents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a novel web-based therapist-assisted self-management intervention for adolescents whose parents have alcohol use problems. METHODS: Participants were recruited on the internet from social media and websites containing health-related information about adolescents. Possible participants were screened using the short version of the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test-6. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (n=101) or the waitlist control group (n=103), and they were unblinded to the condition. The assessments, all self-assessed, consisted of a baseline and 2 follow-ups after 2 and 6 months. The primary outcome was the Coping With Parents Abuse Questionnaire (CPAQ), and secondary outcomes were the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), and Ladder of Life (LoL). RESULTS: For the primary outcome, CPAQ, a small but inconclusive treatment effect was observed (Cohen d=-0.05 at both follow-up time points). The intervention group scored 38% and 46% lower than the control group on the continuous part of the AUDIT-C at the 2- and 6-month follow-up, respectively. All other between-group comparisons were inconclusive at either follow-up time point. Adherence was low, as only 24% (24/101) of the participants in the intervention group completed the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings were inconclusive for the primary outcome but demonstrate that a digital therapist-assisted self-management intervention may contribute to a reduction in alcohol consumption. These results highlight the potential for digital interventions to reach a vulnerable, hard-to-reach group of adolescents but underscore the need to develop more engaging support interventions to increase adherence.

10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1479207,A virtual reality-based self-guided training on identification of negative automatic thoughts in healthy adults: a mixed-methods feasibility study,"Yang B, Liao C, Yang Y, Shi B, Zhang C, Li C.",Front Psychiatry,2024,2024.12.12,,,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive restructuring (CR) is an evidence-based psychological technique for depression. However, face-to-face CR is not easily accessible. Digital CR interventions often overlook the difficulties individuals experiencing depression encounter in identifying their negative automatic thoughts (NAT), leading to suboptimal outcomes. Virtual Reality (VR) has potential advantages in assisting the identification of NAT in CR intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this preliminary feasibility study is to assess the efficacy, acceptability and safety of a VR-based self-guided training on the identification of negative automatic thoughts (VR-STINAT) for depression, as well as to evaluate the user experience. METHODS: In a mixed methods study, 20 healthy participants underwent VR-STINAT and completed a semi-structured interview, followed by post-training homework. The VR-STINAT includes three modules: psychological education, NAT identification training in VR scenarios, and practice in personally experienced scenarios. Effectiveness was measured via Thought Record Skills Assessment (TRSA) of homework and Cognitive Therapy Awareness Scale (CTAS). Acceptability was measured using an adapted Technology Acceptance Model and duration of training. Safety was measured via Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and self-reported negative emotions. Qualitative material was analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The VR-STINAT was acceptable, with an average rating of 80.68%. The accuracy of NAT identification in TRSA reached 84.55%, and CTAS correctness reached 76.67%. The majority of participants experienced minimal or no side effects, although a few (10%, 2/20) reported relatively severe fatigue and craniofacial pain. Thematic analysis reviewed four themes: effectiveness, acceptability, advantages of VR, difficulties in use and suggestions for improvement. Most participants indicated that they've learned how to identify their NAT through VR-STINAT (85%, 17/20), which was engaging (90%, 18/20) and easy to use (60%, 12/20). CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that self-guided training for the identification of negative automatic thoughts related to depression using VR is feasible. Future studies are needed to compare the efficacy of VR with other intervention modalities in people with depression."

The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and cost utility of Alpha-Stim cranial electrostimulation (CES) delivered through a nurse led primary care clinic as a daily treatment for anxiety and depression symptoms by the student at home in contrast to usual primary care. METHOD: Feasibility and acceptability of a nurse led clinic offering Alpha-Stim CES in terms of the take up and completion of the six-week course of Alpha-Stim CES. Change in score on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 as measures of anxiety and depression symptoms at baseline and at 8 weeks following a course of Alpha-Stim CES. Similar evaluation in a non-randomised control group attending a family doctor over the same period. Cost-utility analysis of the nurse led Alpha-Stim CES and family doctor pathways with participants failing to improve following further NICE Guideline clinical care (facilitated self-help and cognitive behaviour therapy). RESULTS: Of 47 students (mean age 22.1, years, 79% female opting for Alpha-Stim CES at the nurse-led clinic 46 (97.9%) completed a 6-week daily course. Forty-seven (47) students comprised a comparison group receiving usual family doctor care. Both Alpha-Stim CES and usual family doctor care were associated with large effect size reductions in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores from baseline to 8 weeks. There were no adverse effects and only one participant showed a clinically important deterioration in the Alpha-Stim group. In the cost utility analysis, Alpha-Stim CES was a cheaper option than usual family doctor care under all deterministic or probabilistic assumptions. CONCLUSION: Nurse delivered Alpha-Stim CES may be a feasible, acceptable and cheaper way of providing greater choice and home-based care for some university students seeking help from primary care with new presentations of anxiety and depression."
10.1186/s40814-024-01475-7,Precision computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) for adolescents with depression: a pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial protocol for SPARX-UK,"Khan K, Hall CL, Babbage C, Dodzo S, Greenhalgh C, Lucassen M, Merry S, Sayal K, Sprange K, Stasiak K, Tench CR, Townsend E, Stallard P, Hollis C; Digital Youth research team.",Pilot Feasibility Stud,2024,2024.3.27,,,"BACKGROUND: A serious game called SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-factor thoughts), originally developed in New Zealand and incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles, has been shown to help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents with mild to moderate depression in studies undertaken in Australasia. However, SPARX has never been trialled in the United Kingdom (UK), and there have been issues relating to low engagement when it has been used in a real-world context. AIMS: To conduct the first pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) in England to explore the use of SPARX in different settings. The trial will explore whether SPARX supported by an e-coach (assistant psychologists) improves adherence and engagement compared with self-directed (i.e. self-help) use. The trial results will be used to inform the optimal mode of delivery (SPARX supported vs. SPARX self-directed), to calculate an appropriate sample size for a full RCT, and to decide which setting is most suitable. METHODS: Following consultation with young people to ensure study suitability/appropriateness, a total of 120 adolescents (11-19 years) will be recruited for this three-arm study. Adolescents recruited for the study across England will be randomised to receive either SPARX with human support (from an e-coach), self-directed SPARX, or a waitlist control group. Assessments will be conducted online at baseline, week 4, and 8-10-week post-randomisation. The assessments will include measures which capture demographic, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire modified for adolescents [PHQ-A]) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale [RCADS]) symptomatology, and health-related quality-of-life data (EQ-5D-Y and proxy version). Analyses will be primarily descriptive. Qualitative interviews will be undertaken with a proportion of the participants and clinical staff as part of a process evaluation, and the qualitative data gathered will be thematically analysed. Finally, feasibility data will be collected on recruitment details, overall study uptake and engagement with SPARX, participant retention, and youth-reported acceptability of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The findings will inform the design of a future definitive RCT of SPARX in the UK. If the subsequent definitive RCT demonstrates that SPARX is effective, then an online serious game utilising CBT principles ultimately has the potential to improve the provision of care within the UK's health services if delivered en masse.

This commentary examines publicly available information on 2017-2018 outcomes in the UK government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, a National Health Service (NHS) primary care mental health programme in England. In that year there were 1.4 million referrals into IAPT and over 500,000 people completed a course of treatment. The IAPT database collects routine session-by-session outcome monitoring data for this population, including outcomes for depression and anxiety in a stepped care model which includes a range of psychological therapies, among them Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Person-centred Experiential Therapy, known in the IAPT programme as Counselling for Depression (CfD).In 2017-18, 32% of all referrals were for anxiety and stress disorders, 26% for depression, and 35% were unspecified. The definition of treatment completion is receipt of 2 sessions or more and on this basis 60% of all referrals in 2017-18 did not complete treatment, predominantly because they failed to attend the initial appointment, or ended after only one session. Four years of data on outcomes for CBT and CfD suggests these therapies are broadly comparable in terms of both recovery rate and average number of sessions, though the number of referrals to each therapy varied widely. Data on treatment choice and satisfaction was favourable but there were issues with low return rates and invalid data. Information on outcomes for ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and religion, as well as a measure of local economic deprivation, indicate lower outcomes for a number of patient groups. Data on employment status outcomes suggest little overall change, including for the category of those on benefits payments.The data published alongside the annual IAPT reports mean there is an increasing amount of information in the public domain about IAPT performance, but it is time consuming to extract and evaluate. This report highlights a number of points of concern which suggest the need for improvement on multiple axes. We suggest that improved researcher access to the huge IAPT dataset can allow for more detailed evaluations of IAPT that can inform policy/decision-making to improve outcomes for clients."

The purpose of the current study is to examine the comparative efficacy, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of a digital psychological intervention when delivered under two models of care (i.e., guided vs. unguided) in supporting the mental health and functioning of adults with epilepsy. METHOD: Approximately 375 participants across Australia will be enrolled. Eligible participants will have a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, experience difficulties with their emotional health, be at least 18 years of age, and live in Australia. Participants will be randomized (2:2:1) to receive the Wellbeing Neuro Course, a 10-week internet-delivered program, with (i.e., guided) or without guidance by a mental health clinician (i.e., unguided), or be allocated to a treatment-as-usual waiting-list control group. Participants will complete online questionnaires at pre-, post-treatment, and 3- and 12-month follow-up and consent to have their data linked to their medical records to capture healthcare system resource use and costs. ANALYSIS: Primary outcome measures will be symptoms of depression and anxiety. A cost-utility analysis will be undertaken using the Australian healthcare system perspective and according to current economic evaluation guidelines. Resource use and costs to the healthcare system during the study period will be captured via data linkage to relevant administrative datasets in Australia. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this trial will provide important data concerning the relative outcomes of these different models of care and will inform the integration of digital psychological interventions translation into healthcare services. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of Macquarie University approved the proposed study (Reference No: 520231325151475). The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication(s). ANZCTR TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12623001327673. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This study seeks to find out if a 10-week online psychological treatment can improve the mental health and well-being of Australian adults with epilepsy. Around 375 participants will be randomly assigned to different groups: one will receive treatment with guidance from mental health clinician (guided group), one without guidance (unguided group), and one starting later (waiting control group). All participants will fill out the same outcome measures online. The main goal of this research is to compare these groups and assess how well the treatment works in improving mental health outcomes."

Providing supportive text messages to individuals with substance use disorder offers the prospect of managing and improving symptoms of drug misuse and associated comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the impact of the daily supportive text message program (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) in mitigating cravings and mental health symptoms in subscribers and quantify user satisfaction with the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program. METHODS: Subscribers to the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program received daily supportive text messages for 3 months; the messages were crafted based on addiction counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy principles. Participants completed an anonymous web-based questionnaire to assess cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms using the Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale at enrollment (baseline), after 6 weeks, and after 3 months. Likert scale satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the Text4Hope-Addiction program. RESULTS: In total, 408 people subscribed to the program, and 110 of 408 (26.9%) subscribers completed the surveys at least at one time point. There were significant differences between the mean baseline and 3-month BSCS scores P=.01 (-2.17, 95% CI -0.62 to 3.72), PHQ-9 scores, P=.004 (-5.08, 95% CI -1.65 to -8.51), and GAD-7 scores, P=.02 (-3.02, 95% CI -0.48 to -5.56). Participants who received the supportive text messages reported a reduced desire to use drugs and a longer time interval between substance use, which are reflected in 41.1% and 32.5% decrease, respectively, from baseline score. Approximately 89% (23/26) of the participants agreed that Text4Hope-Addiction program helped them cope with addiction-related stress, and 81% (21/25) of the participants reported that the messages assisted them in dealing with anxiety. Overall, 69% (18/26) of the participants agreed that it helped them cope with depression related to addiction; 85% (22/26) of the participants felt connected to a support system; 77% (20/26) of the participants were hopeful of their ability to manage addiction issues; and 73% (19/26) of the participants felt that their overall mental well-being was improved. Most of the participants agreed that the interventions were always positive and affirmative (19/26, 73%), and succinct (17/26, 65%). Furthermore, 88% (21/24) of the participants always read the messages; 83% (20/24) of the participants took positive or beneficial actions after reading; and no participant took a negative action after reading the messages. In addition, most participants agreed to recommend other diverse technology-based services as an adjunctive treatment for their mental and physical health disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Subscribers of Text4Hope-Addiction Support program experienced improved mental health and addiction symptoms. Addiction care practitioners and policy makers can implement supportive text-based strategies to complement conventional treatments for addiction, given that mobile devices are widely used."

C-LEARN is designed to determine how to build a service program and individual client capacity to improve mental health-related quality of life among individuals at risk for depression, with exposure to social risk factors or concerns about environmental hazards in areas of Southern Louisiana at risk for events such as hurricanes and storms. The study uses a Community Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR) framework to incorporate community priorities into study design and implementation. The first phase of C-LEARN is assessment of community priorities, assets, and opportunities for building resilience through key informant interviews and community agency outreach. Findings from this phase will inform the implementation of a two-level (program-level and individual client level) randomized study in up to four South Louisiana communities. Within communities, health and social-community service programs will be randomized to Community Engagement and Planning (CEP) for multi-sector coalition support or Technical Assistance (TA) for individual program support to implement evidence-based and community-prioritized intervention toolkits, including an expanded version of depression collaborative care and resources (referrals, manuals) to address social risk factors such as financial or housing instability and for a community resilience approach to disaster preparedness and response. Within each arm, the study will randomize individual adult clients to one of two mobile applications that provide informational resources on services for depression, social risk factors, and disaster response or also provide psychoeducation on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to enhance coping with stress and mood. Planned data collection includes baseline, six-month and brief monthly surveys for clients, and baseline and 12-month surveys for administrators and staff."

This study examined changes in depressive states among Japanese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A secondary data analysis from a factorial randomized controlled trial involving smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy was performed. Six cohorts (N = 1626) underwent an 8-week intervention during the spring or autumn of 2019-2021, with a 9-month follow-up. We evaluated participants' depressive states weekly using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the intervention, with monthly evaluations thereafter. The follow-up periods included Japan's four states of emergency (SOEs) to control COVID-19. Hypothesizing that SOEs caused a sudden worsening of depressive states, Study 1 compared the cohorts' PHQ-9 scores, and Study 2 employed time series analysis with a mixed-effects model to estimate identified changes in PHQ-9 scores. RESULTS: Although no changes in depressive states were observed in relation to the SOEs, Study 1 identified sudden increases in PHQ-9 scores at the 28-week evaluation point, which corresponded to the beginning of the new academic year for the three autumn cohorts. In contrast, the three spring cohorts did not exhibit similar changes. Study 2 showed that, for all three autumn cohorts (n = 522), the 0.60-point change was significant (95% CI 0.42-0.78; p < .001) at 28 weeks; that is, when their timeline was interrupted. CONCLUSIONS: While the results do not indicate any notable impact of the SOEs, they highlight the influence of the new academic year on university students' mental health during COVID-19.

A qualitative investigation of blending internet self-help with face-to-face cognitive behaviour therapy for depression,"Cerga-Pashoja A, Doukani A, Gega L, Walke J, Araya R.",Psychother Res,2020,2020.2.7,,,"Objectives: Numerous studies and reviews have explored the value of adding therapist support to internet self-help for improving client adherence and outcomes. This study is different as it explores the value of adding internet self-help to face-to-face therapy, from the perspective of practitioners who used both. This study explores practitioners' experiences of whether-and how-internet self-help blended with face-to-face therapy may confer an added value or become an added burden to their routine practice. Methods: Using a structured topic guide, we collected narrative data via 3 focus groups and 1 telephone interview from 11 practitioners across two sites in England. We carried out a thematic analysis within two domains, ""value vs. burden"". Results: Practitioners reported that internet self-help can confer added value to face-to-face therapy by: fostering client engagement with face-to-face sessions; making therapy ubiquitous beyond sessions; and preventing therapeutic drift between sessions. Conversely, internet self-help can add burden to face-to-face therapy when it is experienced as disruptive, overwhelming and time-consuming. Conclusions: Recognizing and mitigating factors that can turn internet self-help from an added value to an added burden will help practitioners adopt and make the most out of blended therapy."

ICBT's effectiveness has been investigated in treating and managing conditions like depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, chronic pain, and phobias. ICBT's role in the treatment of medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus with comorbid psychiatric illnesses was also explored. Furthermore, this study elaborates on its cost-effectiveness and its impact in rural areas. We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar with no restrictions on the date. ICBT's role in treating and controlling psychiatric illnesses has been established in the literature. From the data compiled, we conclude that ICBT is useful in treating mental health and medical illnesses with psychiatric comorbidities. It has also been found to be cost-effective for patients and society. ICBT is a potential tool emerging with modern day technological advancements and is useful in rural and urban settings, across various languages and cultures, and on a global scale. Larger randomized control trials on its use in clinical practice and in reaching rural populations are bound to shed more light on the effectiveness of this tool along with spreading awareness among physician and patient communities."
10.1016/j.cct.2024.107658,A real-world longitudinal study implementing digital screening and treatment for distress in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The COMPASS-IBD study protocol,"Jones ASK, Harding S, Seaton N, Hudson JL, Duff A, Wroe A, Singh H, Norton S, Picariello F, Moss-Morris R.",Contemp Clin Trials,2024,2024.8.9,,,"INTRODUCTION: Co-morbid anxiety and depression (distress) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results in poorer outcomes and increased healthcare burden. IBD services require scalable treatment pathways for distress to meet this need. This real-world longitudinal study evaluates the implementation of a new integrated care pathway for distress including: 1) routine mental health screening and 2) therapist-guided, digital CBT tailored to the challenges of living with IBD (compass with adaptations for IBD: COMPASS-IBD) in a UK National Health Service (NHS) large gastroenterology service (∼ 5000 patients). METHODS: We describe a mixed-methods, observational, real-world longitudinal study. Routine mental health screening in the IBD service will identify patients with distress (using pre-defined clinical cut-offs), who will be triaged to determine appropriate treatment pathways (including participation in the COMPASS-IBD study). Participants will receive COMPASS-IBD online for ∼12 weeks (including 6 × 30-min therapist sessions). Key implementation outcomes will assess reach and adoption of the new pathway using aggregate data on uptake of mental health screening, eligibility, and consent rates for COMPASS-IBD, and number of COMPASS-IBD sessions completed. Interviews with patients and healthcare providers will primarily assess acceptability of the new pathway. Potential effectiveness will be assessed using participant questionnaires at pre-intervention, 12-weeks (post-intervention), and 6-month follow-up. The primary effectiveness outcome will be pre-post changes in distress (PHQ-ADS scores). Quantitative data will be summarised using descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. CONCLUSION: Study findings will inform treatment pathways for co-morbid distress in IBD, and highlight adaptations required to increase future scalability and effectiveness.

Efficacious methods of intervention that are patient-centered and adaptable to a mobile and often difficult-to-reach population would be useful in improving quality of life. This article describes a new protocol developed as part of a randomized clinical trial of a telephone-mediated program for SMs with mTBI. The 12-session program combines problem solving training (PST) with embedded modules targeting depression, anxiety, insomnia, and headache. The rationale and development of this behavioral intervention for implementation with persons with multiple co-morbidities is described along with the proposed analysis of results. In particular, we provide details regarding the creation of a treatment that is manualized yet flexible enough to address a wide variety of problems and symptoms within a standard framework. The methods involved in enrolling and retaining an often hard-to-study population are also highlighted."

However, disparities in their physical, mental, and health empowerment outcomes have not been fully explored, particularly in relation to the moderating effect of eHealth literacy. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess these disparities and examine how eHealth literacy moderates them to guide the development of tailored nonpharmacological strategies. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2 waves of the nationally representative ""Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents"" surveys to identify participants who self-reported asthma, COPD, or both. We assessed 5 physical outcomes (quality of life, physical activity, sleep quality, appetite, nicotine dependence), 4 mental outcomes (anxiety, depression, perceived stress, resilience), and 3 health empowerment measures (social support, self-efficacy, eHealth literacy). Multiple regression with Holm-Bonferroni corrections revealed health disparities and the moderation effect of eHealth literacy. RESULTS: This unfunded study enrolled 1044 participants between June 2022 and August 2023, with data analysis completed within 7 months following data collection. The sample included 254 (24.3%) participants with asthma, 696 (66.7%) participants with COPD, and 95 (9.1%) participants with both conditions. The mean age of the participants was 48.61 (SD 19.70) years, and 536 (51.3%) participants were male. Linear regression showed that individuals with both COPD and asthma had lower health-related quality of life and higher anxiety and depression compared with those with either condition alone (b ranges from -0.15 to 3.35). This group also showed higher nicotine dependence than asthma-only (b=0.88) and lower resilience than COPD-only groups (b=-0.76) (all adjusted P<.05). eHealth literacy significantly moderated the effect of the disease group on all outcomes except physical activity (all adjusted P for interaction <.05). Nine disease pairs showed disparities in both eHealth literacy groups, 4 only in high literacy, and 8 only in low literacy (all P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with both COPD and asthma had poorer quality of life, greater anxiety and depression, higher nicotine dependence, and lower resilience, underscoring the need for integrated psychosocial and behavioral interventions. Although higher eHealth literacy was associated with improved quality of life, sleep quality, and resilience, it also widened disparities in anxiety and depression. Therefore, while enhancing eHealth literacy may help reduce overall health inequities among patients with chronic respiratory diseases, its potential adverse effects on mental well-being warrant careful attention. Moreover, lower eHealth literacy was linked to more pronounced disparities, indicating that outreach efforts and digital resources should be specifically designed to reach and empower vulnerable populations. Overall, our findings advocate for condition-specific, eHealth-enhanced care pathways that not only foster digital literacy but also integrate comprehensive mental health services, thereby mitigating health disparities among individuals with chronic respiratory diseases."
10.1111/bjc.12244,Preventing relapse with personalized smart-messaging after cognitive behavioural therapy: A proof-of-concept evaluation,"Malins S, Biswas S, Patel S, Levene J, Moghaddam N, Morriss R.",Br J Clin Psychol,2020,2020.1.22,,,"OBJECTIVES: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can improve symptoms of anxiety and depression, but also reduces the risk of future relapse after therapy completion. However, current CBT relapse prevention methods are resource-intensive and can be limited in clinical practice. This paper investigates a personalized means of reducing relapse using smart-messaging in two settings: research and routine care. DESIGN: Study 1 presents a cohort study comparing a cohort of smart-messaging users versus non-users. Study 2 presents time series follow-up data from a case series of smart-messaging users from clinical practice. METHODS: Fifteen of 56 CBT completers who participated in a trial for the treatment of health anxiety wrote advice they would want if in future they were doing well, experiencing early warning signs of relapse, or experiencing full relapse. Following CBT, participants received weekly text-message requests to rate their well-being. Dependent upon their response, participants received tailored advice they had written, appropriate to the well-being level reported after recovery from health anxiety. Smart-messaging was also trialled in a routine practice sample of 14 CBT completers with anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Across a 12-month follow-up, participants receiving smart-messaging showed greater health improvements than those who did not. Well-being scores showed stability between CBT completion and 6-month follow-up among routine care patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a low-intensity, personalized relapse prevention method can have a clinical benefit following CBT for common mental health problems. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Post-treatment outcomes may be improved using personalized smart-messaging to prevent relapse following cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for health anxiety. In clinical practice, post-treatment smart-messaging can be well-used by patients and may help maintain stable well-being in the 6 months after CBT ends. This evidence supports the clinical utility of a brief tailored digital intervention, which can be integrated within routine clinical practice with minimal therapist input. Overall, longer-term post-CBT outcomes may be improved by integrating a smart-messaging intervention at the end of therapy."

Comment in JAMA Psychiatry. 2020 Jul 1;77(7):768. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0616. IMPORTANCE: Despite the prevalence and adverse consequences of prenatal insomnia, a paucity of research is available regarding interventions to improve insomnia symptoms during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) compared with standard treatment among pregnant women with insomnia symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial enrolled pregnant women from November 23, 2016, to May 22, 2018. Of the 2258 women assessed for eligibility using an online self-report questionnaire, 208 were randomized to receive digital CBT-I (n = 105) or standard treatment (n = 103) for insomnia. Participants were pregnant up to 28 weeks' gestation, and they either had elevated insomnia symptom severity or met the criteria for insomnia caseness as determined by self-report questionnaires. Participants completed outcome measures at 10 weeks (postintervention) and 18 weeks (follow-up) after randomization. All study visits were completed remotely, and the intervention was delivered digitally. Data were analyzed between December 12, 2018, and July 2, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Digital CBT-I consisted of 6 weekly sessions of approximately 20 minutes each. Standard treatment reflected standard care. Women receiving standard treatment had no limits placed on the receipt of nonstudy treatments, including medication and psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcomes were assessed remotely using self-report questionnaires administered via online survey. The primary outcome was the change in insomnia symptom severity (measured by the Insomnia Severity Index) from baseline to postintervention. Secondary outcomes were sleep efficiency and nightly sleep duration (defined by sleep diary), global sleep quality (measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), depressive symptom severity (measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and anxiety symptom severity (measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7). For each outcome, we also examined the change from baseline to follow-up. RESULTS: The 208 participants had a mean (SD) age of 33.6 (3.7) years and a mean (SD) gestational age of 17.6 (6.3) weeks at baseline. Most of the participants were white (138 [66.3%]), married or cohabiting (196 [94.2%]), had a college degree (180 [86.5%]), and earned $100 000 or more per year (141 [67.8%]). Women randomized to receive digital CBT-I experienced statistically significantly greater improvements in insomnia symptom severity from baseline to postintervention compared with women randomized to receive standard treatment (time-by-group interaction, difference = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.23; χ2 = 29.8; P < .001; d = -1.03). Improvements from baseline to postintervention for all secondary outcomes, with the exception of sleep duration, were statistically significant. A similar pattern of results was evident for the change from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this trial, digital CBT was an effective, scalable, safe, and acceptable intervention for improving insomnia symptoms during pregnancy.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been proven effective in adults but research in university students, who struggle to maintain a 24-hour rhythm, is still limited. We hypothesize that a guided digital CBT-I intervention, enriched with components on the biological clock ('i-Sleep & BioClock') will be effective in reducing insomnia severity and improving mental health outcomes for students with sleep problems. OBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a guided online sleep and biological clock self-help intervention in improving sleep, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, functioning, academic performance, and quality of life in university students at 6 weeks and 18 weeks. METHODS: This is a two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial, comparing a 5-week guided online 'i-Sleep & BioClock' intervention to online psychoeducation (PE). We aim to include 192 university students (Bachelor, Master, and PhD) with at least subthreshold insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index ≥10), aged ≥16, who can speak Dutch or English. We are excluding students with current risk for suicide or night shifts. The primary outcome is insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes include sleep estimates (sleep and light exposure diary), depression, anxiety, functioning, quality of life, and academic performance. The effectiveness of the intervention compared to online PE will be evaluated using linear mixed models. DISCUSSION: The current study tests the effectiveness of an online self-help intervention for university students who suffer from sleep problems. This trial builds upon an open feasibility study and will provide evidence of an online guided self-help program for students. The findings of this study will determine the potential wider dissemination of the intervention to address the high need for available and accessible help for students experiencing insomnia.

10.1016/j.invent.2022.100600,A therapist-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for Hong Kong university students with psychological distress: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Pan JY, Carlbring P, Lu L.",Internet Interv,2022,2023.1.12,,,"BACKGROUND: University students are at high risk of various mental health problems due to high levels of psychological distress. However, university counseling services are often inadequate to meet their mental health needs due to shortage of mental health professionals, especially in Hong Kong. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has shown similar effects as those of face-to-face CBT in addressing these mental health concerns, but few iCBT programs have been developed for Hong Kong university students. OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to develop and evaluate a culturally and linguistically appropriate iCBT program called ""REST Online"" to reduce the psychological distress and improve the mental health of Chinese university students in Hong Kong in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHOD: The contents and functionality of the ""REST Online"" program which includes both web- and app-based versions, are described. A blended mode of service delivery is adopted, with 8 online modules and 2 counseling sessions. Therapist support will be provided by a CBT therapist. A total of 338 Chinese university students with mild to moderate levels of psychological distress will be openly recruited and randomized to three groups: the (1) web-based and (2) app-based ""REST Online"" groups, and (3) waitlist control group. The program effectiveness is evaluated in psychological distress, depression and anxiety symptoms, and positive and negative emotions and positive and negative thoughts at pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up tests. Linear mixed effect models will be conducted for data analysis. DISCUSSION: The ""REST Online"" program is among the first of its kind to address the mental health needs of Hong Kong university students by an internet intervention. Theoretically, this study will provide some empirical evidence for the effectiveness of this iCBT program in the Hong Kong context for Chinese clients. Practically, if proven effective, this program can be provided to local university counselors as an option for service delivery. Strengths and limitations are also discussed."
10.1111/jpm.12679,Factors affecting suicidal ideation among premenopausal and postmenopausal women,"Kim GU, Son HK, Kim MY.",J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,2021,2020.8.2,,,"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Pre- and postmenopausal women (PPW) experience changes in physical, psychological and social health. South-East Asia's female suicide rate is the highest compared with other countries, and the suicide rate of PPW in these countries continues to increase. The most influential factor in Asian women's suicidal ideation is family conflict; specifically, if PPW in South Korea cannot express their anger, it results in a culture-bound syndrome called ""Hwa-Byung."" However, there is a lack of research on Asian PPW. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This study found differences in individual- and community-level factors affecting suicidal ideation between pre- and postmenopausal women. Individual factors that commonly affected suicidal ideation were experiencing violence, stress and depression. Individual factors that affected the suicidal ideation of premenopausal women more than postmenopausal women were religious beliefs, alcohol use and chronic disease. Community level factors affecting suicidal ideation were locational depression and locational counselling for stress in premenopausal women and locational counselling for depression in postmenopausal women. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health nurses could help prevent suicide by developing and applying community-based programmes for PPW, considering the specific socio-economic and cultural context and characteristics of Asian women. Mental health nurses could help PPW participate in programmes by preparing various interventions such as case management, personal counselling, physical activity, home-based mental health services, cognitive behavioural therapy and digital interventions for self-management. Mental health nurses need to prepare various methods such as online, offline, individual and group methods to work effectively in any social situation. ABSTRACT: Introduction Pre- and postmenopausal women (PPW) experience physical and psychological changes with hormonal changes. Among Asian middle-aged women, family and culture affect suicidal ideation, and the suicide rate among this population is increasing. There are few existing research on suicidal ideation among Asian PPW. Aim We examined individual- and community-level factors that predict suicidal ideation among PPW. Method Large-scale panel data from 5,154 South Korean PPW aged 35-64 years were used in a series of multilevel logistic regression analyses to examine factors associated with suicidal ideation at individual and community levels. Results Among premenopausal women, religious beliefs, alcohol use, chronic disease, experience of violence, stress and depression were individual-level factors. Locational depression and locational counselling for stress were community-level factors. Among postmenopausal women, experience of violence, stress, depression and perceived health status were individual level factors, and locational counselling for depression was a community level factor. Discussion Suicidal ideation among PPW is affected by both individual and community level factors. Nurses must comprehensively determine what risk factors affect suicidal ideation through various intervention methods-including online, offline, individual and group methods-while considering socio-economic situations. Implications for Practice Mental health nurses should provide targeted biopsychosocial interventions targeting psychosocial and physical problems and promoting the use of community resources to reduce PPW's suicidal ideation."

METHODS: 126 participants (85 patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or specific phobias, and 41 controls without mental disorders) completed smartphone-based ambulatory ratings (activities, social interactions, mood, physical symptoms) and motion sensor-based indices of physical activity (steps, time spent moving, metabolic activity) at baseline, during, and after exposure-based treatment. RESULTS: Prior to treatment, patients showed reduced mood and physical activity relative to healthy controls. Over the course of therapy, mood ratings, interactions with strangers and indices of physical activity improved, while reported physical symptoms decreased. Overall results did not differ between patients with primary panic disorder/agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder. Higher depression scores at baseline were associated with larger changes in reported symptoms and mood ratings, but smaller changes in physical activity CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based treatment initiates increased physical activity, more frequent interaction with strangers, and improvements in everyday mood. The current approach provides objective and fine-graded process and outcome measures that may help to further improve treatments and possibly reduce relapse."

However, less is known about interventions to prevent and treat perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). This review synthesizes existing research on PMAD prevention and treatment by exploring the treatment modalities and efficacy of online interventions and examining the inclusion of underserved populations in PMAD research. METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, authors conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published between 2008 and 2018 on online interventions aimed to prevent or treat PMADs. The authors also assessed quality. Eligible articles included perinatal women participating in preventive studies or those aimed to reduce symptoms of PMADs and utilized a Web-based, Internet, or smartphone technology requiring an online component. This study excluded telephone-based interventions that required one-on-one conversations or individualized, text-based responses without a Web-based aspect. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 511 articles, and the final analysis included 23 articles reporting on 22 interventions. Most studies used an experimental design. However, no study achieved an excellent or good quality rating. Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) were most common. Several interventions using CBT strategies significantly decreased depression or anxiety. Four studies recruited and enrolled mainly people identifying as low-income or of a racial or ethnic minority group. Attrition was generally high across studies. DISCUSSION: More research using rigorous study designs to test PMAD interventions across all perinatal times is needed. Future research needs to engage diverse populations purposefully."

Positive experiences were reported by both patients and providers from routine check-ups, to use of cognitive behavioral therapy associated with mental disorders, and management of complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis and other neurological and psychiatric conditions. Integration into standard care looks likely in the post pandemic era with many healthcare systems moving to expand reimbursement categories and develop equitable incentive models for developers and providers. In this commentary we share perspective on how the future of care may evolve through hybrid delivery models, and the advent of new therapeutic approaches which can address pain points identified during the pandemic."

Yet, there is limited real-world evidence for its effectiveness. This study investigated the use and effectiveness of a free iCBT programme ('Just a Thought') in New Zealand. METHODS: We analysed 18 months of user data from the Just a Thought website to understand the characteristics of those who used the Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder courses, how many lessons they completed, how mental distress changed across each course and the factors associated with adherence and improvement in mental health. RESULTS: The results for both courses followed very similar patterns. Course adherence was low overall. There were small differences in adherence by age, gender and ethnicity, and larger differences for those who were 'prescribed' Just a Thought by a healthcare worker. Mixed models showed significant reductions in mental distress, with some tapering of improvement across latter lessons. Those most likely to show clinically meaningful reductions in mental distress had completed more lessons, were older and had a higher baseline level of distress. CONCLUSION: Alongside previous efficacy research, this real-world data indicate that iCBT is most likely to be effective at the population level and across different subgroups if users complete as much of the course as possible. Strategies to increase course adherence and maximise the public health benefits of iCBT include healthcare workers 'prescribing' iCBT and tailored solutions to meet the needs of young people, Māori and Pasifika."

Here, we summarised and consolidated findings from existing systematic reviews to provide an overview of what is known, and which areas need further investigation. Systematic searches were conducted until January 2024 using PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar. Records were screened against predefined criteria and quality assessed using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews. A study protocol was co-developed with key stakeholders and registered on the Open Science Framework. From 941 records, 51 systematic reviews published between 2000 and 2023 of generally moderate quality, targeting CYP 0 to 25 years, were included in our narrative summary. DMHIs were delivered in a variety of ways, including online video calls, apps and various combinations, underpinned mostly by cognitive behaviour therapy. DMHIs supported different mental health problems, but mostly symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Although generally effective, some studies reported mixed results with limited evidence when focusing on longer-term outcomes. Other benefits of DMHIs included reduced costs and time investments for families, and increased accessibility and acceptability of support. Practitioner preparedness and unclear ethics/safety measures were identified as factors impacting engagement and potential effectiveness. The findings suggest that DMHIs can be a valuable tool for supporting CYP. However, realising the full potential of DMHIs for all CYP may require more high-quality research utilising DMHIs that are diverse in theoretical underpinnings and target audiences."

The intervention was designed for breast cancer patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels of psychological symptoms. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to the immediate intervention arm (n = 61; intervention received immediately) or to the delayed intervention arm (n = 59; intervention received 5 months later). Psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), worry, and intrusive thoughts were assessed through questionnaires. Emotion regulation was assessed in a dynamic emotion regulation task and in everyday life. Assessments were completed at baseline (T1), 5 months (T2) and 10 months (T3) later. RESULTS: Treated patients reported lower levels of worry and intrusive thoughts. They improved their ability to down-regulate the intensity of their negative emotions when exposed to cancer-related triggers in the dynamic emotion regulation task. They reported fewer and less intense negative emotions and more positive emotions in their everyday life. Benefits were maintained 5 months later, except for positive emotions in everyday life. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that focusing on emotion regulation is a relevant approach in the treatment of psychological symptoms for breast cancer patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels of psychological symptoms. The intervention led to changes in patients' dynamic and everyday life emotion regulation. Consolidation sessions may be needed to sustain benefits in positive emotions and to increase the effect sizes."
10.2196/63139,"Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Provided Through a Web Application for Subthreshold Depression, Subthreshold Insomnia, and Subthreshold Panic: Open-Labeled 6-Arm Randomized Clinical Trial Pilot Study","Taguchi K, Miyoshi M, Seki Y, Baba S, Shimizu E.",JMIR Form Res,2025,2025.2.3,,,"BACKGROUND: A common definition of ""subthreshold"" is that the diagnostic threshold is not met but the individuals are not asymptomatic. Some symptoms are present, causing significant difficulty in functioning and negatively impacting quality of life. Despite the attention given to subthreshold symptoms and the interventions for subthreshold symptoms being efficient in preventing the transition to psychiatric disease in primary care, reports on specific interventions are insufficient. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for subthreshold depression (SD), subthreshold insomnia (SI), and subthreshold panic (SP). Additionally, this study aimed to explore the minimally important change (MIC) of each subthreshold group's effectiveness outcome. METHODS: Participants aged 18-70 years from internet research monitors were categorized into SD, SI, and SP groups based on screening assessment. They were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups within each subthreshold symptom. The intervention groups worked on 4 weeks of nonguided ICBT (""Mentre""), while the control groups worked on a sham app. The primary outcome was the score change from screening (T1) to 4-week follow-up (T4) using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) in the SD group, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in the SI group, and the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) in the SP group. Secondary outcomes were score changes in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the CESD, the PSQI, and the PAS, except the primary outcome in each group. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using complete-case analysis and repeated-measures ANOVA. Additionally, the MIC in the primary endpoint for each group was also calculated as an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: The SD, SP, and SI groups contained 846, 597, and 1106 participants, respectively. In the SD group, the difference in the CESD score change from baseline to follow-up between the intervention and control groups was significant (difference=0.52, 95% CI 1.29-4.66, P<.001). In the SI group, the difference in the PSQI score change was also significant (difference=0.53, 95% CI 0.11-0.94, P=.01). However, in the SP group, the difference in the PAS score change was not significant (difference=0.07, 95% CI -2.00 to 2.15, P=.94). CONCLUSIONS: Our ICBT program Mentre contributes to the improvement of SI and SD. This suggests that nonguided ICBT may be effective in preventing SI and SD from progressing to the full threshold. However, appropriate definitions of subthreshold symptoms are necessary. In particular, it is difficult to define SP, and further research that considers the specific factors of each subthreshold symptom is necessary to accumulate evidence.

Students are limited in seeking help from professionals. As university students are highly connected to digital technologies, Web-based and computer-delivered interventions could be used to improve students' mental health. The effectiveness of these intervention types requires investigation to identify whether these are viable prevention strategies for university students. OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to systematically review and analyze trials of Web-based and computer-delivered interventions to improve depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress in university students. METHODS: Several databases were searched using keywords relating to higher education students, mental health, and eHealth interventions. The eligibility criteria for studies included in the review were: (1) the study aimed to improve symptoms relating to depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress, (2) the study involved computer-delivered or Web-based interventions accessed via computer, laptop, or tablet, (3) the study was a randomized controlled trial, and (4) the study was trialed on higher education students. Trials were reviewed and outcome data analyzed through random effects meta-analyses for each outcome and each type of trial arm comparison. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: A total of 17 trials were identified, in which seven were the same three interventions on separate samples; 14 reported sufficient information for meta-analysis. The majority (n=13) were website-delivered and nine interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A total of 1795 participants were randomized and 1480 analyzed. Risk of bias was considered moderate, as many publications did not sufficiently report their methods and seven explicitly conducted completers' analyses. In comparison to the inactive control, sensitivity meta-analyses supported intervention in improving anxiety (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.56; 95% CI -0.77 to -0.35, P<.001), depression (pooled SMD -0.43; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.22, P<.001), and stress (pooled SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.19, P=.008). In comparison to active controls, sensitivity analyses did not support either condition for anxiety (pooled SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.98 to 0.62, P=.66) or depression (pooled SMD -0.28; 95% CI -0.75 to -0.20, P=.25). In contrast to a comparison intervention, neither condition was supported in sensitivity analyses for anxiety (pooled SMD -0.10; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.18, P=.48) or depression (pooled SMD -0.33; 95% CI -0.43 to 1.09, P=.40). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest Web-based and computer-delivered interventions can be effective in improving students' depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes when compared to inactive controls, but some caution is needed when compared to other trial arms and methodological issues were noticeable. Interventions need to be trialed on more heterogeneous student samples and would benefit from user evaluation. Future trials should address methodological considerations to improve reporting of trial quality and address post-intervention skewed data."

Online cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) programmes provide scalable access to psychological interventions, although the effectiveness of iCBT for OCD during COVID-19 has not been evaluated. AIM: This study investigated the uptake and effectiveness of iCBT for OCD (both self- and clinician-guided courses) during the first 8 months of the pandemic in Australia (March to October 2020) and compared outcomes with the previous year. METHOD: 1,343 adults (824/1343 (61.4%) female, mean age 33.54 years, SD = 12.00) commenced iCBT for OCD (1061 during the pandemic and 282 in the year before) and completed measures of OCD (Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9) symptom severity, psychological distress (Kessler-10), and disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule) pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: During COVID-19, there was a 522% increase in monthly course registrations compared with the previous year, with peak uptake observed between April and June 2020 (a 1191% increase compared with April to June 2019). OCD and depression symptom severity were similar for the COVID and pre-COVID groups, although COVID-19 participants were more likely to enrol in self-guided courses (versus clinician-guided). In both pre- and during-COVID groups, the OCD iCBT course was associated with medium effect size reductions in OCD (g = 0.65-0.68) and depression symptom severity (g = 0.56-0.65), medium to large reductions in psychological distress (g = 0.77-0.83) and small reductions in disability (g = 0.35-.50). CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate the considerable uptake of online psychological services for those experiencing symptoms of OCD during COVID-19 and highlight the scalability of effective digital mental health services."

This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of a novel transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for adults with neurological disorders. METHODS: 221 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or an acquired brain injury were allocated to either an immediate treatment group (n = 115) or treatment-as-usual waitlist control (n = 106). The intervention, the Wellbeing Neuro Course, was delivered online via the eCentreClinic website. The Course includes six lessons, based on cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered over 10 weeks with support from a psychologist via email and telephone. Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). RESULTS: 215 participants commenced the trial (treatment n = 111; control n = 104) and were included in intention-to-treat analysis. At post-treatment, we observed significant between-group differences in depression (PHQ-9; difference = 3.07 [95% CI 2.04-4.11], g = 0.62), anxiety (GAD-7; difference = 1.87 [0.92-2.81], g = 0.41) and disability (WHODAS 2.0 difference = 3.08 [1.09-5.06], g = 0.31), that favoured treatment (all ps < 0.001). Treatment-related effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Findings were achieved with minimal clinician time (average of 95.7 min [s.d. = 59.3] per participant), highlighting the public health potential of this approach to care. No adverse treatment events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-delivered psychological interventions could be a suitable model of accessible supportive care for patients with neurological disorders."

First, we tested whether patients with bipolar disorder would score higher on mental imagery measures than a matched healthy control group. Second, we examined differences in imagery between patients divided into groups according to their level of mood stability. Mood ratings over approximately 6-months, made using a mobile phone messaging system, were used to divide patients into stable or unstable groups. Clinician decisions of mood stability were corroborated with statistical analysis. Results showed (I) compared to healthy controls, patients with bipolar disorder had significantly higher scores for general mental imagery use, more vivid imagery of future events, higher levels of intrusive prospective imagery, and more extreme imagery-based interpretation bias; (II) compared to patients with stable mood, patients with unstable mood had higher levels of intrusive prospective imagery, and this correlated highly with their current levels of anxiety and depression. The findings were consistent with predictions. Further investigation of imagery in bipolar disorder appears warranted as it may highlight processes that contribute to mood instability with relevance for cognitive behaviour therapy."

This review focuses on non-pharmacologic management strategies that impact pain and affect, with a focus on self-efficacy, for those with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed both office-based and internet-based self-management strategies, mindfulness based interventions (MBIs), and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) for patients with arthritis. These behavioral strategies have shown to improve pain, mood disturbance, and physical function in those with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Improvements in self-efficacy and coping capacity are associated with improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) related to pain and functioning. SUMMARY: Self-management programs, MBIs, and CBTs are more effective at improving pain and mood disturbance compared to usual care for patients with arthritis although high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking. Non-pharmacologic management programs are increasingly available via the internet and mobile applications."

Pain results in disability, psychosocial distress, repeated clinic visits/hospitalizations, and significant healthcare costs. Psychosocial pain interventions that teach cognitive and behavioral strategies for managing pain have been effective in other adolescent populations when delivered in person or through digital technologies. Our aim was to conduct a multisite, randomized, controlled trial to improve pain and coping in youth aged 12 to 18 years with SCD using a digital cognitive-behavioral therapy program (iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease; iCC-SCD) vs Education control. We enrolled 137 participants (ages 12-18 years, 59% female) and analyzed 111 adolescents (107 caregivers), 54 randomized to Education control and 57 randomized to iCC-SCD. Ninety-two percent of youth completed posttreatment assessments and 88% completed 6-month follow-up. There was a significant effect of treatment group (iCC-SCD vs Education) on reduction in average pain intensity from baseline to 6-month follow-up (b = -1.32, P = 0.009, 95% CI [-2.29, -0.34], d = 0.50), and for the number of days with pain, adolescents in the iCC-SCD group demonstrated fewer pain days compared with the Education group at 6-month follow-up (incident rate ratio = 0.63, P = 0.006, 95% CI [0.30, 0.95], d = 0.53). Treatment effects were also found for coping attempts, momentary mood, and fatigue. Several secondary outcomes did not change with intervention, including anxiety, depression, pain interference, and global impression of change. Future studies are needed to identify effective implementation strategies to bring evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for sickle cell pain to SCD clinics and communities."
10.1186/s12889-024-20820-2,Insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic: prevalence and correlates in a multi-ethnic population Singapore,"Satghare P, Abdin E, Shafie S, Devi F, Zhang YJ, Chua BY, Shahwan S, Subramaniam M.",BMC Public Health,2024,2024.12.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Globally, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on mental health. Sudden lifestyle changes, threatening information received through various sources, fear of infection and other stressors led to sleep disturbances such as insomnia. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of insomnia and its associated risk factors during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic among Singapore residents. METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted online and in person, from May 2020 to June 2021, recruited Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 21 years and above, fluent in English, Chinese or Malay language. Respondents answered an interviewer-administered questionnaire, including Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), stress scale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS), chronic conditions checklist and COVID-19 related stressors (exposure to COVID-19, current and future perceived risk of infection). Chi-squared test followed by stepwise logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine factors associated with insomnia. RESULTS: The study recruited 1129 respondents. Prevalence of insomnia was noted to be 7.4% in the sample. Insomnia was significantly associated with psychological distress- depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001), financial loss as a source of stress (p < 0.012), ever been diagnosed with asthma (p < 0.001) and backache (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Insomnia was prevalent and associated with higher level of psychological distress among Singapore residents. These findings can be utilised to design effective targeted interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy, therapist assisted relaxation and meditation programs to improve sleep and reduce psychological distress. Interventions like these can be delivered via smartphone applications enabling easy access, delivery, and utilization by the vulnerable groups. Overall, these strategies would not only help people maintain better mental health and sleep quality during a pandemic but also build resilience, enhancing society's ability to cope with future crises."
10.2196/jmir.7583,Improving Employee Well-Being and Effectiveness: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Web-Based Psychological Interventions Delivered in the Workplace,"Carolan S, Harris PR, Cavanagh K.",J Med Internet Res,2017,2017.7.28,,,"BACKGROUND: Stress, depression, and anxiety among working populations can result in reduced work performance and increased absenteeism. Although there is evidence that these common mental health problems are preventable and treatable in the workplace, uptake of psychological treatments among the working population is low. One way to address this may be the delivery of occupational digital mental health interventions. While there is convincing evidence for delivering digital psychological interventions within a health and community context, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis of these interventions in an occupational setting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of occupational digital mental health interventions in enhancing employee psychological well-being and increasing work effectiveness and to identify intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Cochrane guidelines. Papers published from January 2000 to May 2016 were searched in the PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases, as well as the databases of the researchers and relevant websites. Unpublished data was sought using the Conference Proceedings Citation Index and the Clinical Trials and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) research registers. A meta-analysis was conducted by applying a random-effects model to assess the pooled effect size for psychological well-being and the work effectiveness outcomes. A positive deviance approach was used to identify those intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. RESULTS: In total, 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the search criteria. Occupational digital mental health interventions had a statistically significant effect post intervention on both psychological well-being (g=0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.50) and work effectiveness (g=0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41) compared with the control condition. No statistically significant differences were found on either outcome between studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches (as defined by the authors) compared with other psychological approaches, offering guidance compared with self-guidance, or recruiting from a targeted workplace population compared with a universal workplace population. In-depth analysis of the interventions identified by the positive deviance approach suggests that interventions that offer guidance are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users (ie, emails and text messages [short message service, SMS]), and use elements of persuasive technology (ie, self-monitoring and tailoring), which may achieve greater engagement and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that occupational digital mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological well-being and increase work effectiveness. It identifies intervention characteristics that may increase engagement. Recommendations are made for future research, practice, and intervention development."

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a proven treatment for many psychological disorders. It has been extensively studied and is effective for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, a bibliometric analysis of the CBT literature for these disorders is needed. This study reviewed this field's research and identifies key trends, influential studies, and gaps. METHODS: Using MeSH-generated keywords and PRISMA guidelines, the Scopus database retrieved bibliographic data without temporal or geographical constraints. Data-driven studies were analyzed for performance, collaborative pattern, impact, co-word frequency, knowledge structure, and trending topics using R-package-based Bibliometrix and VOSviewer applications. The current study applied bibliometric and statistical analyses. RESULTS: Scopus yielded 2757 studies since inception in 1979. The polynomial regression coefficient of 0.945 (R2) indicates a strong positive trend, and the research has increased at an annual rate of 12.67 %. Scholars from five countries had a noteworthy production of CBT research in treating PsD, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands. Depression, oppositional defiant disorder, schizophrenia, and implementation are the clusters in the CBT research map. The thematic map needed to meet the desired criteria for representing all anticipated themes. Thematic evolution is evidence of noticeable changes that contributed to the creation of new research clusters and the disappearance of some of them. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the adoption and efficacy of internet-based interventions for mental health. The cross-sectional study provides valuable insights into the development and dissemination of CBT in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance of training, awareness, and research. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes that further investigation be conducted in contemporary literature to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing policy decisions regarding CBT."

This paper describes the protocol of the GoalRx Prescription Intervention (GPI) which was designed to leverage community resources to provide tailored park prescriptions for PHC patients. METHODS: The GPI study was designed as a 3-arm, multi-site observational study. We enrolled low-income, rural adults either at-risk of or living with hypertension or diabetes (n = 75) from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in two counties in North Carolina, USA into the 3-month intervention. Eligible participants self-selected to receive (1) a tailored park prescription intervention; (2) a tailored home/indoor PA prescription intervention; or (3) a healthy eating prescription (with no PA prescription beyond standard PA counseling advice that is already routinely provided in PHC) as the comparison group. The GPI app paired patient health data from the electronic health record with stated patient preferences and triggered app-integrated SMS motivation and compliance messaging directly to the patient. Patients were assessed at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up upon the completion of the intervention. The primary outcome (mean difference in weekly physical activity from baseline (T0) to post-intervention (T1) as measured by the Fitbit Flex 2) was assessed at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included assessment of the relationship between the intervention and biological markers of health, including body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c or available glucose test (if applicable), and a depression screen score using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Secondary outcomes also included the total number of SMS messages sent, number of SMS messages responded to, number of SMS messages ignored, and opt-out rate. DISCUSSION: The goal was to create a protocol utilizing eHealth technologies that addressed the specific needs of rural low-income communities and fit into the natural rhythms and processes of the selected FQHC clinics in North Carolina. This protocol offered a higher standard of health care by connecting patients to their PHC teams and increasing patient motivation to make longer-lasting health behavior changes."

This study presents the first evaluation of the uptake and outcomes of iCBT for health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: THIS WAY UP is an Australian digital mental health service which delivers iCBT interventions to community members. We compared the uptake of THIS WAY UP's iCBT course for health anxiety in an Australian adult sample who started the course before the pandemic (12th September 2019-11 th March 2020) to during the pandemic (12th March to 11th June 2020). The course was accessible to Australian adults over 18 years old, with no inclusion criteria. Outcomes included course registrations and commencements, lesson and course completion, and self-reported health anxiety (Short Health Anxiety Inventory), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item) and distress (Kessler-10). RESULTS: From March to June 2020, we observed significant increases in course registrations (N = 238 vs N = 1057); and course commencements (N = 126 vs. N = 778). Large, significant improvements in health anxiety (g = 0.89), and distress (K10: g = 0.91), and medium improvements in depression (g = 0.55) were found. Course completion during COVID was 30.5%. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT improved health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides scalable intervention that can address increased demands for mental health services in the community."

Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs offer a more accessible method of receiving care. Here, we conducted an open trial of an iCBT program for medical students and characterize program usage, program users, and self-reported psychosocial symptoms and coping skills. METHODS: All incoming first year medical students at a large state-run university were invited to use an iCBT program which focused on mood management and mood symptom prevention. Participants received access to the 16-week program and completed measures of perceived stress, quality of life, and the development of cognitive and behavioral coping skills at baseline and end of program. RESULTS: Of the 194 students in the class, 53 (27.32%) signed up to use the program. While the program attracted a representative portion of underrepresented minority students, program engagement among males was particularly low. Repeated use of the program was low. Self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were low at baseline, and continued to be low at end of program. Slight increases were observed from baseline to end of program in the self-reported use of cognitive coping skills. CONCLUSIONS: Digital mental health tools appear to be of interest to first year medical students, but need to be better designed to support continued program use and to attract specific subgroups of students who may face additional barriers to seeking mental health services."

The evidence for virtual reality (VR) based psychological treatments for driving phobia is unknown. This systematic review synthesized the available evidence on the effectiveness, feasibility, and user experience of psychological treatments for driving phobia using VR. METHODS: Three databases (PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and PubMed) were searched. Eligibility criteria included adults with clinical or sub-clinical levels of driving phobia manifesting as part of an anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Primary outcomes were driving-related anxiety/fear or avoidance, PTSD symptoms and driving frequency/intensity, as well as treatment feasibility including recruitment, treatment completion and retention rates, user experience and immersion/presence in the VR program. Secondary outcomes were other health outcomes (e.g., depression) and VR technological features. RESULTS: The 14 included studies were of low methodological quality. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity prevented quantitative pooling of data. The evidence provided in this review is limited by trials with small sample sizes, and lack of diagnostic clarity, controlled designs, and long-term assessment. The evidence did suggest that VR-based psychological interventions could be feasible and acceptable in this population. CONCLUSIONS: For VR-based psychological interventions to be recommended for driving phobia, more high-quality trials are needed. Implications for rehabilitationVirtual reality (VR) based psychological treatments may be feasible and acceptable to patients with driving phobia.There is potential to increase accessibility to psychological therapies in patients with driving phobia following motor vehicle crashes through the use of digital psychiatry such as VR."

Psychological interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), have demonstrated promising results in enhancing emotional resilience, treatment adherence, and QoL. This systematic review aims to evaluate the role and effectiveness of psychological interventions in improving the QoL among individuals with CF. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across the PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases for studies published between 2014 and 2024, in line with PRISMA guidelines and a registered PROSPERO protocol. Out of 162 initially identified articles, six clinical studies met the inclusion criteria. Intervention included cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions, employing several digital or telehealth formats such as fibrosis-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CF-CBT) and the coping and learning to manage stress (CALM) program, often delivered via telehealth. Results: Most interventions demonstrated significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress, alongside improvements in coping self-efficacy and vitality. Cohen's d-effect sizes ranged from moderate to large for core psychological outcomes. QoL measures, particularly vitality and emotional functioning, were significantly enhanced in most studies. Conclusions: Psychological interventions, particularly CBT and ACT, significantly improve mental health and QoL in individuals with CF, supporting their integration into routine care."
10.1186/s13063-021-05912-3,Augmenting an online self-directed intervention for gambling disorder with a single motivational interview: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Brazeau BW, Hodgins DC, Cunningham JA, Bennett K, Bennett A.",Trials,2021,2021.12.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite the success of gold standard cognitive-behavioral therapy for problem and disordered gambling, the majority of individuals with gambling problems do not seek or receive professional treatment. Thus, the development of less intrusive self-directed interventions has been encouraged. Bibliotherapy for problem gambling has shown promise, both alone and in combination with motivational interviews, but there is still a lack of online self-directed intervention research. The current randomized controlled trial proposes to assess the additive benefit of a single digital motivational interview delivered in conjunction with an online self-directed treatment program for problem gambling and gambling disorder. METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted, wherein eligible participants (N=270) will be recruited across Canada via internet advertisements posted to several platforms. All participants will receive access to an online self-directed gambling intervention program. Participants will be randomly assigned to either complete the online program alone or receive a digital motivational interview, conducted through an online audioconferencing platform (i.e., Microsoft Teams) to supplement the online program. The primary outcomes of gambling severity, frequency, and expenditures will be tracked along with secondary outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, general distress, alcohol use, and online program user data) over a 24-month period. It is expected that participants in both groups will experience a reduction in symptoms across the board, but more substantial improvements will be observed in the group that receives a supplemental motivational interview. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will expand upon prior gambling intervention research by informing best practices for the provision of online self-help for problem gambling.

However, there is a lack of integrated, accessible, and evidence-based treatment options for these young adults. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of an integrated, online self-help program designed to target both alcohol misuse and emotional problems. METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial design will be used to compare the efficacy of the online integrated treatment to a psychoeducational control group. A target sample of 214 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either condition. The integrated treatment will last 8 weeks, and participants will work through 12 modules. Modules will incorporate content based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. Participants in the control group will receive links to psychoeducational resources and will have access to the full treatment after follow-up. The primary outcome will be the number of Canadian standard drinks consumed in the week leading up the assessment. Secondary outcomes of interest include symptoms of depression, anxiety, alcohol-related problems, quality of life, and use of other drugs. Assessments will be completed at 3 time-points: at baseline, at the end of treatment (ie, 8 weeks), and at follow-up (ie, 24 weeks). Upon completion, data will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: Data collection began in June 2018 and will continue until January 2020. Final study results will be submitted for publication by July 2020.

A growing body of evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces perfectionism and psychological disorders, with medium to large effect sizes. Given the increased desire for Web-based interventions to facilitate access to evidence-based therapy, Internet-based CBT self-help interventions for perfectionism have been designed. Existing Web-based interventions have not included personalized guidance which has been shown to improve outcome rates. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an Internet-based guided self-help CBT intervention for perfectionism at reducing symptoms of perfectionism and psychological disorders posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial method is employed, comparing the treatment arm (Internet-based guided self-help CBT) with a waiting list control group. Outcomes are examined at 3 time points, T1 (baseline), T2 (postintervention at 12 weeks), T3 (follow-up at 24 weeks). Participants will be recruited through universities, online platforms, and social media and if eligible will be randomized using an automatic randomizer. RESULTS: Data will be analyzed to estimate the between group (intervention, control) effect on perfectionism, depression, and anxiety. Completer and intent-to-treat analyses will be conducted. Additional analysis will be conducted to investigate whether the number of modules completed is associated with change. Data collection should be finalized by December 2016, with submission of results for publication expected in mid-year 2017. Results will be reported in line with recommendations in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement for Randomized Controlled Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online TeleHealth (CONSORT-EHEALTH). CONCLUSIONS: Findings will contribute to the literature on treatment of perfectionism, the effect of treating perfectionism on depression and anxiety, and the efficacy of Internet-based guided self-help interventions.

We investigated whether clinical and economic outcomes were improved by offering remote cognitive behaviour therapy (RCBT) using videoconferencing or telephone compared to treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: A single-blind, parallel group, multicentre randomised controlled trial was undertaken in primary and general hospital care. Participants were aged ≥18 years with ≥2 unscheduled healthcare contacts within 12 months and scored >18 on the Health Anxiety Inventory. Randomisation to RCBT or TAU was stratified by site, with allocation conveyed to a trial administrator, research assessors masked to outcome. Data were collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome was change in HAI score from baseline to six months on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes were generalised anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, function and overall health. Health economics analysis was conducted from a health service and societal perspective. RESULTS: Of the 524 patients who were referred and assessed for trial eligibility, 470 were eligible and 156 (33%) were recruited; 78 were randomised to TAU and 78 to RCBT. Compared to TAU, RCBT significantly reduced health anxiety at six months, maintained to 9 and 12 months (mean change difference HAI -2.81; 95% CI -5.11 to -0.50; P = 0.017). Generalised anxiety, depression and overall health was significantly improved at 12 months, but there was no significant change in physical symptoms or function. RCBT was strictly dominant with a net monetary benefit of £3,164 per participant at a willingness to pay threshold of £30,000. No treatment-related adverse events were reported in either group. CONCLUSIONS: RCBT may reduce health anxiety, general anxiety and depression and improve overall health, with considerable reductions in health and informal care costs in repeat users of unscheduled care with severe health anxiety who have previously been difficult to engage in psychological treatment. RCBT may be an easy-to-implement intervention to improve clinical outcome and save costs in one group of repeat users of unscheduled care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 Nov 2014 with reference number NCT02298036."

In biofeedback, patients learn to voluntarily modify their bodily reactions through feedback mediated awareness of physiological parameters, thus promoting relaxation, reducing stress and preventing migraine attacks. We aim to assess the efficacy of biofeedback on adult patients with migraine. Study protocol was registered on PROSPERO with reference number CRD42024606671. PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar were searched for randomized controlled trials from 2000 to 2024 in English that have evaluated the administration of biofeedback to the adult patients with migraine. High quality studies were included after RoB 2.0 Risk of Bias assessment. ANOVA with inverse variance weighting was used to compare mean differences across groups with 95 % confidence interval. Nine studies (558 participants) and three studies (278 participants) respectively qualified for comparison of biofeedback with waiting list control and active treatment. Biofeedback significantly reduced headache frequency and severity compared to waiting-list control. However, it showed no significant difference in headache frequency when compared to active treatments such as pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Additionally, improvements in migraine-related disability, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were reviewed. This meta-analysis confirms that biofeedback is an effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing headache frequency and severity in migraines. Additionally, it appears to provide synergistic benefits when combined with pharmacotherapy. However, future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of home-based and app-based biofeedback to determine its broader clinical applicability."

It focuses on post-treatment survivors aged 13-39 years, examining the types of interventions trialled, their efficacy in enhancing different facets of mental well-being, and any potential negative impacts. The review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO and utilised randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, peer support, and physical activity programmes. METHODS: Fifteen studies involving 1109 participants were included, covering interventions across multiple modes of delivery; online, in-person, and app-based. RESULTS: Interventions demonstrated varied effects on outcomes like quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress, mood, behaviour, coping skills, and social support. While some interventions, such as psychoeducation and physical activity programs, showed promising improvements in well-being, others demonstrated limited or mixed results. No significant adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures pose challenges for definitive conclusions, emphasising the need for future research with standardised measures, consistent sample sizes, and long-term follow-up to better assess the sustainability of intervention effects. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of tailored psychosocial support to address the unique needs of TYA cancer survivors during their survivorship journey."
10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2025.105112,Effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in nurses with shift work sleep disorder: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Brückner HA, Ell J, Kalon L, Strahler J, Ducki A, Riemann D, Buntrock C, Spiegelhalder K, Lehr D.",Int J Nurs Stud,2025,2025.5.22,,,"BACKGROUND: Shift work is associated with many adverse effects on health and, in particular, affects sleep. In nurses, one of the most common forms of insomnia is shift work sleep disorder. Traditional face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is often impractical for shift-working nurses due to irregular work schedules. Digital therapy presents a promising alternative to provide nurses with access to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of the digital SleepCare intervention for reducing insomnia in nurses being affected by shift work sleep disorder. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 74 nurses affected by shift work sleep disorder. METHODS: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial, SleepCare was compared to shift work-specific psychoeducation published digitally by the German Sleep Society. The diagnosis of shift work sleep disorder was established through a clinical interview. The primary outcome was insomnia severity as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index at baseline before randomization, at 8 weeks, and 3 months after randomization. Further indicators of mental health and long-term hair cortisol concentration were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis of covariance showed a greater reduction in insomnia severity in the intervention group versus psychoeducation, at both post-intervention (d = 1.11[0.7-1.6]) and follow-up (d = 0.97 [0.5-1.4]), corresponding to between-group differences of 5.0 and 5.3 points on the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. 56 % completed at least five of the six sessions and results indicated larger effects for these intervention completers with d = 1.49 and d = 1.28, respectively. Statistically significant effects were observed for sleep-related, but not other mental health indicators, for example, stress and depression. Reduced hair cortisol levels were observed post-intervention in the SleepCare group (V = 82, p = .008; Δ = -1.8 pg/mg, 44 % reduction from baseline). CONCLUSIONS: SleepCare was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms to a clinically meaningful extent and is one of the first digitally delivered programs to adapt cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia with specific exercises to address nurses' needs for shift work. The development of effective strategies to promote treatment adherence seems necessary, as substantially larger effects were observed for intervention completers.

10.2196/25294,A Suite of Mobile Conversational Agents for Daily Stress Management (Popbots): Mixed Methods Exploratory Study,"Mauriello ML, Tantivasadakarn N, Mora-Mendoza MA, Lincoln ET, Hon G, Nowruzi P, Simon D, Hansen L, Goenawan NH, Kim J, Gowda N, Jurafsky D, Paredes PE.",JMIR Form Res,2021,2021.9.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 60%-80% of the primary care visits have a psychological stress component, but only 3% of patients receive stress management advice during these visits. Given recent advances in natural language processing, there is renewed interest in mental health chatbots. Conversational agents that can understand a user's problems and deliver advice that mitigates the effects of daily stress could be an effective public health tool. However, such systems are complex to build and costly to develop. OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, our aim is to develop and evaluate a fully automated mobile suite of shallow chatbots-we call them Popbots-that may serve as a new species of chatbots and further complement human assistance in an ecosystem of stress management support. METHODS: After conducting an exploratory Wizard of Oz study (N=14) to evaluate the feasibility of a suite of multiple chatbots, we conducted a web-based study (N=47) to evaluate the implementation of our prototype. Each participant was randomly assigned to a different chatbot designed on the basis of a proven cognitive or behavioral intervention method. To measure the effectiveness of the chatbots, the participants' stress levels were determined using self-reported psychometric evaluations (eg, web-based daily surveys and Patient Health Questionnaire-4). The participants in these studies were recruited through email and enrolled on the web, and some of them participated in follow-up interviews that were conducted in person or on the web (as necessary). RESULTS: Of the 47 participants, 31 (66%) completed the main study. The findings suggest that the users viewed the conversations with our chatbots as helpful or at least neutral and came away with increasingly positive sentiment toward the use of chatbots for proactive stress management. Moreover, those users who used the system more often (ie, they had more than or equal to the median number of conversations) noted a decrease in depression symptoms compared with those who used the system less often based on a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (W=91.50; Z=-2.54; P=.01; r=0.47). The follow-up interviews with a subset of the participants indicated that half of the common daily stressors could be discussed with chatbots, potentially reducing the burden on human coping resources. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that suites of shallow chatbots may offer benefits for both users and designers. As a result, this study's contributions include the design and evaluation of a novel suite of shallow chatbots for daily stress management, a summary of benefits and challenges associated with random delivery of multiple conversational interventions, and design guidelines and directions for future research into similar systems, including authoring chatbot systems and artificial intelligence-enabled recommendation algorithms."

This raises questions about its incremental effectiveness compared to less demanding minimal interventions such as sleep hygiene psychoeducation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the incremental efficacy of self-guided iCBT-I with optional on-demand feedback for university students with insomnia compared to a single session of digital psychoeducation on sleep hygiene. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 90 students with insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index ≥10) were randomly allocated to self-help-based iCBT-I (45/90, 50%) or one session of digital sleep hygiene psychoeducation with stimulus control instructions (active control group [aCG]: 45/90, 50%). The self-help-based iCBT-I consisted of 6 sessions on psychoeducation, sleep restriction, and stimulus control, including written feedback on demand from an eCoach. Assessments occurred at baseline (T1), 8 weeks after treatment (T2), and at a 6-month follow-up (T3) via web-based self-assessment and diagnostic telephone interviews. The primary outcome was insomnia severity at T2. Analyses of covariance were conducted in an intention-to-treat sample. Secondary outcomes included diagnoses of insomnia and major depression, sleep quality, sleep efficiency, worrying, recovery experiences, recovery activities, presenteeism, procrastination, cognitive irritation, and recuperation in sleep. RESULTS: There was no difference in insomnia severity at T2 between the iCBT-I group (mean 11.27, SD 5.21) and aCG group (mean 12.36, SD 4.16; F1,989.03=1.12; P=.29; d=-0.26; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.17). A significant difference emerged at T3 (iCBT-I: mean 9.43, SD 5.36; aCG: mean 12.44, SD 5.39; F1,426.15=4.72; P=.03), favoring iCBT-I with a medium effect (d=-0.57; 95% CI 1.07 to -0.06). Most secondary outcomes revealed no significant differences between the groups. In total, 51% (23/45) of participants in the iCBT-I group completed all 6 sessions, and 69% (31/45) completed the 4 core sessions. CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, students might benefit from low-intensity, easily accessible digital sleep hygiene psychoeducation or iCBT-I. However, it appears that iCBT-I offers superiority over sleep hygiene psychoeducation in the long term.

Clients with psychosis are at increased risk of poorer medium- and long-term psychosocial and clinical outcomes. In response to the pressing need to flexibly deliver high-quality care to individuals with psychosis, this brief report proposes high yield cognitive behavioral techniques for psychosis (HY-CBt-p) facilitated by task sharing and digital enhancements. HY-CBt-p is delivered over fewer sessions than formulation-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp), can be learned by a range of providers, and includes techniques such as developing a normalizing explanation; techniques to reduce anxiety, depression, and insomnia, which perpetuate psychotic symptoms; self-monitoring; reality testing; and wellness planning. Previous research suggests that effect sizes will be lower than that of 16-session formulation-driven CBTp, but additional research is needed to test the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and comparative effectiveness of different forms of remote-delivered CBTp."

Examining the effects of psychotherapy treatment history on outcomes of single session, transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral interventions for university students","Finch EF, Kleiman EM, Bentley KH, Bernstein EE.",Psychol Serv,2024,2023.6.29,,,"Brief, transdiagnostic interventions are an efficient form of mental health care for resource-limited settings like universities. Little research, however, has examined for whom these treatments are most effective. One important factor may be psychotherapy treatment history. Here, we evaluate if treatment history influences the effects of a single-session cognitive behavioral group intervention with optional digital follow-up support across two independent, university-based studies. Undergraduate (N = 143) and graduate (N = 51) students reported their psychotherapy treatment history and completed self-report measures of emotional health before and approximately 1-month following the intervention. Across both samples, psychotherapy treatment history did not moderate changes in depression, anxiety, or emotional avoidance following the intervention. However, participants who were currently receiving psychotherapy began the workshop with lower coping self-efficacy than peers with no prior psychotherapy and saw larger gains in coping self-efficacy at follow-up. Results suggest that regardless of whether a student has previously received psychotherapy, they may benefit from brief, group transdiagnostic interventions.

Large patient data sets using routine outcome measures allows the investigation of treatment effects over time as well as the relationship between outcomes and platform use. Understanding trajectories of symptom change, as well as associated characteristics, may prove important for tailoring interventions or identifying patients who may not benefit from the intervention. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify latent trajectories of symptom change during the iCBT treatment course for depression and anxiety and to investigate the patients' characteristics and platform use for each of these classes. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness of guided iCBT for anxiety and depression in the UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program. This study included patients from the intervention group (N=256) and followed a longitudinal retrospective design. As part of the IAPT's routine outcome monitoring system, patients were prompted to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) after each supporter review during the treatment period. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify the underlying trajectories of symptom change across the treatment period for both depression and anxiety. Differences in patient characteristics were then evaluated between these trajectory classes, and the presence of a time-varying relationship between platform use and trajectory classes was investigated. RESULTS: Five-class models were identified as optimal for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Around two-thirds (PHQ-9: 155/221, 70.1%; GAD-7: 156/221, 70.6%) of the sample formed various trajectories of improvement classes that differed in baseline score, the pace of symptom change, and final clinical outcome score. The remaining patients were in 2 smaller groups: one that saw minimal to no gains and another with consistently high scores across the treatment journey. Baseline severity, medication status, and program assigned were significantly associated (P<.001) with different trajectories. Although we did not find a time-varying relationship between use and trajectory classes, we found an overall effect of time on platform use, suggesting that all participants used the intervention significantly more in the first 4 weeks (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients benefit from treatment, and the various patterns of improvement have implications for how the iCBT intervention is delivered. Identifying predictors of nonresponse or early response might inform the level of support and monitoring required for different types of patients. Further work is necessary to explore the differences between these trajectories to understand what works best for whom and to identify early on those patients who are less likely to benefit from treatment."

Research with adults has demonstrated that Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) can improve both sleep and mental health. However, research with adolescents is lacking, and we know little about whether CBTi would have similar effects on this younger population. OBJECTIVE: This paper summarizes the protocol of a study to assess the feasibility of adding supported Web-based CBTi to the usual care of young people aged 14-17 years attending specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). METHODS: This is an open trial where we will recruit young people (N=50) aged 14-17 years attending specialist CAMHS with primary or comorbid symptoms of insomnia. In addition to their usual care, young people will be provided with Sleepio, a 6-session, Web-based CBTi self-help program for insomnia. Sleepio teaches a range of techniques including sleep hygiene, relaxation training, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and cognitive techniques that participants will be helped to apply through brief, weekly telephone support calls. Questionnaires and interviews will be completed at baseline and postintervention (8-10 weeks) and will assess sleep, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and acceptability of Sleepio and telephone support. RESULTS: Recruitment started in May 2018 and continued until the end of October 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide preliminary evidence about whether supported Web-based CBTi is acceptable to young people with mental health problems and about the postintervention effects on sleep and symptoms of anxiety and depression. This information will determine whether a randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of Sleepio should be undertaken. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/11324."

Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer a promising platform to deliver mental health treatment, which may address OC symptoms. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the effects of a DMHI, Bend Health, on various domains of OC symptoms, including contamination, responsibility (for harm), unwanted thoughts, and symmetry, in adolescents. METHODS: OC symptoms were assessed at baseline (before beginning care) and monthly in adolescents engaged in different care programs involving coaching and/or therapy with the DMHI. Retrospective analyses were used to identify characteristics associated with OC symptoms (N = 2151) and to characterize treatment responsiveness of adolescents with elevated OC symptoms (n = 553). RESULTS: Adolescents with elevated OC symptoms (32.2%; n = 693 of 2151) were more likely than those with non-elevated OC symptoms to be female (p < .001), to have comorbid symptoms (e.g. anxiety and depression; p < .001), and participate in therapy (p < .001). Further, their caregivers had higher rates of sleep problems and burnout (p < .05). OC symptoms improved for 87.7% (n = 485 of 532) of adolescents during care with the DMHI, and 46.6% (n = 249 of 534) reported clinically substantive improvement. Scores decreased significantly over months in care (t1187 = -8.06, p < .001). Improvements were also identified for OC symptom dimensions (contamination, responsibility (for harm), unwanted thoughts, and symmetry). CONCLUSIONS: Our results deliver compelling preliminary evidence that participation in coaching and therapy with a DMHI may mitigate a variety of OC symptoms for adolescents. Improvements were observed across different OC symptom types, demonstrating the broad applicability of the DMHI to address various presentations and complexities of OC symptoms."

However, disrupted sleep is highly prevalent after stroke and is often associated with poor motor recovery and quality of life. Previous research has shown that digital cognitive behavioural therapy (dCBT) for insomnia can be effective at improving sleep quality after stroke. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the potential for sleep improvement using a dCBT programme, to improve rehabilitation outcomes after stroke.

Up to 100 participants will be randomly allocated (2:1) into either the intervention (6-8 week dCBT) or control (continued treatment as usual) group. The primary outcome of the study will be change in insomnia symptoms pre to post intervention compared with treatment as usual. Secondary outcomes include improvement in overnight motor memory consolidation and sleep measures between intervention groups, correlations between changes in sleep behaviour and overnight motor memory consolidation in the dCBT group and changes in symptoms of depression and fatigue between the dCBT and control groups.

10.1007/s11121-018-0871-z,Project Date SMART: a Dating Violence (DV) and Sexual Risk Prevention Program for Adolescent Girls with Prior DV Exposure,"Rizzo CJ, Joppa M, Barker D, Collibee C, Zlotnick C, Brown LK.",Prev Sci,2018,2018.1.21,,,"This study assessed the initial feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an intervention aimed at reducing dating violence and sexual risk behavior in a sample of adolescent girls (ages 14-17) with prior exposure to physical dating violence (DV). One hundred and nine girls were randomly assigned to Date SMART (Skills to Manage Aggression in Relationships for Teens) or a Knowledge-only (KO) comparison group. Both intervention arms consisted of six, weekly 2-h sessions and one ""booster"" session 6 weeks later. Based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, the Date SMART intervention was designed to target common underlying skills deficits linked to both DV and sexual risk behavior in adolescent females: depression, self-regulation deficits, and interpersonal skills deficits. Assessments were administered at four time points (baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months). The Date SMART group was effective as reducing sexual DV involvement across the 9-month follow-up period. Both groups evidenced clinically meaningful reductions in physical, emotional, and digital DV involvement, total time in dating relationships, as well as reductions in depression. Findings indicate that delivering a DV and sexual risk prevention intervention to DV-affected adolescent girls is feasible and well-received. Furthermore, a skills-based approach that addresses the co-occurrence of DV and sexual risk behavior may be particularly useful for promoting reductions of sexual DV among high-risk adolescent girls. A future, large-scale trial with an inactive comparison condition is needed to evaluate the efficacy of Date SMART further.

10.1089/tmj.2024.0050,Short- and Long-Term Outcomes of e-Health and Internet-Based Psychological Interventions for Chronic Tinnitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Sattel H, Brueggemann P, Steinmetzger K, Boecking B, Martin A, Dobel C, Mazurek B.",Telemed J E Health,2025,2024.10.25,,,"Objective: e-Health or web-based systems in the field of tinnitus have gained increasing interest. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via the internet is currently witnessing a surge in both attention and offerings. This systematic review analyzed the efficacy and sustainability of internet-based therapies aimed at reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. The review exclusively considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which trained personnel were actively involved during intervention. Methods: Utilizing search terms such as tinnitus, internet-based therapy, and e-Health therapy, we identified 155 studies, from which 37 RCTs were carefully examined for data availability. Primary outcome measures included treatment effects for tinnitus distress (Tinnitus Questionnaire and other questionnaires) and handicap (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory), while secondary outcomes encompassed depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Meta-analyses were conducted employing random-effect models. A study effect model was applied, yielding a singular effect size for each sample. The effect sizes were examined for influences of various moderators. Results: We found a statistically significant large effect size for improvement in tinnitus distress (d = 0.83; [confidence interval 0.61-1.06] with total n = 450 for the experimental group and total n = 504 or the controls), while the reduction of tinnitus handicap was smaller (moderate effect size d = 0.59; [0.44-0.73]). Less strong but still significant effects resulted for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Most of the long-term outcomes remained stable. As moderators, the risk of bias (RoB) and the severity of tinnitus manifestations were identified. Conclusions: Internet-based therapy provides a valuable avenue for initial therapeutic contact, as supporting component in tinnitus treatment if accompanied by therapists. The heterogeneous quality with high drop-out rates or partly high RoB and the wide range of interventions (counseling, eCBT, mindfulness) might be considered as a limiting factor for a first-line management in tinnitus. So far, the use of e-Health is dependent on availability or user preferences."
10.2196/19226,Primary Care Peer-Supported Internet-Mediated Psychological Treatment for Adults With Anxiety Disorders: Mixed Methods Study,"Nissling L, Fahlke C, Lilja JL, Skoglund I, Weineland S.",JMIR Form Res,2020,2020.8.21,,,"BACKGROUND: The effect of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) on anxiety in adults is well-known. However, patient dropouts and poor adherence to treatment are common. Feelings of belonging and empowerment from the treatment might be key to the completion of iCBT. Peer support workers are people with a personal experience of mental health problems, trained to provide professional support to people who require mental health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess patient experiences; the feasibility, safety, and acceptability; and preliminary effectiveness on anxiety and depression, empowerment, and adherence to treatment in an 8-week peer-supported iCBT program for patients with anxiety disorders treated in primary care. METHODS: This was a single-arm mixed methods feasibility study. Participants were patients referred to a central unit for iCBT in primary care. Quantitative data were collected pre-, post-, and 3 months postintervention. Qualitative data were collected through semistructured interviews. RESULTS: A total of 9 participants completed the quantitative outcome assessment. Statistically significant improvements were observed in perceived empowerment at a 3-month follow-up, and significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and psychological distress at the end of the treatment were maintained at a 3-month follow-up. In total, 8 of the 9 patients showed improvement in the severity of their symptoms of anxiety. Adherence to treatment was good among the participants. No serious adverse events were reported. Eight participants were enrolled in the qualitative analysis. The qualitative results showed 3 main themes: (1) real contact in an online world, (2) empowering experiences, and (3) being behind the wheel. Qualitative results largely emphasized the personal relationship and supported the acceptability of adding peer support to iCBT. CONCLUSIONS: Peer support in digital treatment seems to be a safe and acceptable intervention. The preliminary results suggest the effectiveness of peer support on patient empowerment, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and adherence to treatment. The results indicate the need for future studies to evaluate the effect of adding peer support to iCBT in larger randomized controlled trials."
10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1194955,Comparing the efficacy of electronic cognitive behavioral therapy to medication and combination therapy for generalized anxiety disorder: a quasi-experimental clinical trial,"Stephenson C, Moghimi E, Shao Y, Kumar A, Yee CS, Miller S, Stefatos A, Gholamzadehmir M, Abbaspour Z, Jagayat J, Shirazi A, Gizzarelli T, Gutierrez G, Khan F, Patel C, Patel A, Yang M, Omrani M, Alavi N.",Front Psychiatry,2023,2023.12.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a debilitating mental health disorder with first-line treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy. CBT is costly, time-consuming, and inaccessible. Electronic delivery (e-CBT) is a promising solution to address these barriers. However, due to the novelty of this intervention, more research testing the e-CBT efficacy independently and in conjunction with other treatments is needed. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of e-CBT compared to and in conjunction with pharmacotherapy for GAD. METHODS: This study employed a quasi-experimental design where patients selected their preferred treatment modality. Patients with GAD were enrolled in either e-CBT, medication, or combination arms. The 12-week e-CBT program was delivered through a digital platform. The medications followed clinical guidelines. The efficacy of each arm was evaluated using questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety, and stress severity, as well as quality of life. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between arms (N e-CBT = 41; N Medication = 41; N Combination = 33) in the number of weeks completed or baseline scores. All arms showed improvements in anxiety scores after treatment. The medication and combination arms improved depression scores. The e-CBT and Combination arms improved quality of life, and the combination arm improved stress scores. There were no differences between the groups in depression, anxiety, or stress scores post-treatment. However, the combination arm had a significantly larger improvement in quality of life. Gender and treatment arm were not predictors of dropout, whereas younger age was. CONCLUSION: Incorporating e-CBT on its own or in combination with pharmaceutical interventions is a viable option for treating GAD. Treating GAD with e-CBT or medication appears to offer significant improvements in symptoms, with no meaningful difference between the two. Combining the treatments also offer significant improvements, while not necessarily superior to either independently. The findings suggest that all options are viable. Taking the patient's preferred treatment route based on their lifestyle, personality, and beliefs into account when deciding on treatment should be a priority for care providers."
10.7759/cureus.81840,"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Children and Adolescents: A Narrative Review of Mental Health Challenges, Interventions, and Long-Term Trajectories","Lal P, Gupta S.",Cureus,2025,2025.5.8,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents globally. This comprehensive narrative review synthesizes current research on the pandemic's psychological effects on young people, examining emotional distress, behavioral changes, sleep disturbances, educational disruptions, and the exacerbation of pre-existing mental health conditions. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science, covering articles published from January 2020 to December 2024. Studies focusing on children and adolescents (aged 0-18 years) that examined mental health outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Data extraction was performed using a standardized form, and a narrative synthesis approach was employed to analyze and integrate the findings. Key findings reveal a substantial increase in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder among children and adolescents during the pandemic. School closures, social isolation, and disrupted routines have contributed to these mental health challenges. Sleep patterns have been notably affected, with delayed bedtimes, increased sleep disturbances, and a higher prevalence of insomnia and nightmares. The pandemic has widened educational disparities, particularly affecting children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions have experienced exacerbated symptoms and faced challenges in accessing care. Various interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, social-emotional learning programs, and digital mental health support, have shown promise in mitigating the pandemic's psychological impact on young people. Children were more affected, as they faced a global crisis for the first time with limited coping skills. Disruptions in routine, social isolation, and family stressors heightened anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues, making them more affected. This review emphasizes the need for continued research, targeted interventions, and policy development to address the long-term mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents."
10.2196/29137,The Effectiveness of Serious Games in Alleviating Anxiety: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Abd-Alrazaq A, Alajlani M, Alhuwail D, Schneider J, Akhu-Zaheya L, Ahmed A, Househ M.",JMIR Serious Games,2022,2022.2.14,,,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety is a mental disorder characterized by apprehension, tension, uneasiness, and other related behavioral disturbances. One of the nonpharmacological treatments used for reducing anxiety is serious games, which are games that have a purpose other than entertainment. The effectiveness of serious games in alleviating anxiety has been investigated by several systematic reviews; however, they were limited by design and methodological weaknesses. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of serious games in alleviating anxiety by summarizing the results of previous studies and providing an up-to-date review. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The following seven databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We also conducted backward and forward reference list checking for the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently carried out the study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and quality of evidence appraisal. We used a narrative and statistical approach, as appropriate, to synthesize the results of the included studies. RESULTS: Of the 935 citations retrieved, 33 studies were included in this review. Of these, 22 RCTs were eventually included in the meta-analysis. Very low-quality evidence from 9 RCTs and 5 RCTs showed no statistically significant effect of exergames (games entailing physical exercises) on anxiety levels when compared with conventional exercises (P=.70) and no intervention (P=.27), respectively. Although 6 RCTs demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant effect of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy games on anxiety levels when compared with no intervention (P=.01), the quality of the evidence reported was low. Similarly, low-quality evidence from 3 RCTs showed a statistically and clinically significant effect of biofeedback games on anxiety levels when compared with conventional video games (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that exergames can be as effective as conventional exercises in alleviating anxiety; computerized cognitive behavioral therapy games and exergames can be more effective than no intervention, and biofeedback games can be more effective than conventional video games. However, our findings remain inconclusive, mainly because there was a high risk of bias in the individual studies included, the quality of meta-analyzed evidence was low, few studies were included in some meta-analyses, patients without anxiety were recruited in most studies, and purpose-shifted serious games were used in most studies. Therefore, serious games should be considered complementary to existing interventions. Researchers should use serious games that are designed specifically to alleviate depression, deliver other therapeutic modalities, and recruit a diverse population of patients with anxiety."
10.2196/47047,Telehealth and In-Person Behavioral Health Services in Rural Communities Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multisite Prospective Cohort Study,"Ward MM, Ullrich F, Bhagianadh D, Nelson EL, Marcin JP, Carter KD, Law KB, McCord C, Neufeld J, Merchant KAS.",JMIR Ment Health,2023,2023.9.18,,,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered widespread adjustments across the US health care system. Telehealth use showed a substantial increase in mental health conditions and services due to acute public health emergency (PHE) behavioral health needs on top of long-standing gaps in access to behavioral health services. How health systems that were already providing behavioral telehealth services adjusted services and staffing during this period has not been well documented, particularly in rural areas with chronic shortages of behavioral health providers and services. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates patient and treatment characteristic changes from before the COVID-19 PHE to during the PHE within both telehealth and in-person behavioral health services provided in 95 rural communities across the United States. METHODS: We used a nonrandomized, prospective, multisite research design involving 2 active treatment groups. The telehealth cohort included all patients who initiated telehealth treatment regimens during the data collection period. A comparison group included a cohort of patients who initiated in-person treatment regimen. Patient enrollment occurred on a rolling basis, and data collection was extended for 3 months after treatment initiation for each patient. Chi-square tests compared changes from pre-PHE to PHE time periods within telehealth and in-person treatment cohorts. The dependent measures included patient diagnosis, clinicians providing treatment services, and type of treatment services provided at each encounter. The 4780 patients in the telehealth cohort and the 6457 patients in the in-person cohort had an average of 3.5 encounters during the 3-month follow-up period. RESULTS: The encounters involving anxiety, dissociative, and stress-related disorders in the telehealth cohort increased from 30% (698/2352) in the pre-PHE period to 35% (4632/12,853) in the PHE period (P<.001), and encounters involving substance use disorders in the in-person cohort increased from 11% (468/4249) in the pre-PHE period to 18% (3048/17,047) in the PHE period (P<.001). The encounters involving treatment service codes for alcohol, drug, and medication-assisted therapy in the telehealth cohort increased from 1% (22/2352) in the pre-PHE period to 11% (1470/13,387) in the PHE period (P<.001); likewise, encounters for this type of service in the in-person cohort increased from 0% (0/4249) in the pre-PHE period to 16% (2687/17,047) in the PHE period (P<.001). From the pre-PHE to the PHE period, encounters involving 60-minute psychotherapy in the telehealth cohort increased from 8% (190/2352) to 14% (1802/13,387; P<.001), while encounters involving group therapy in the in-person cohort decreased from 12% (502/4249) to 4% (739/17,047; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic challenged health service providers, and they adjusted the way both telehealth and in-person behavioral therapy services were delivered. Looking forward, future research is needed to explicate the interaction of patient, provider, setting, and intervention factors that influenced the patterns observed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."
10.1002/14651858.CD011118.pub2,Psychological therapies (remotely delivered) for the management of chronic and recurrent pain in children and adolescents,"Fisher E, Law E, Palermo TM, Eccleston C.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2015,2015.3.25,,,"Update in Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019 Apr 02;4:CD011118. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD011118.pub3. BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common during childhood and adolescence and is associated with negative outcomes such as increased severity of pain, reduced function (e.g. missing school), and low mood (e.g. high levels of depression and anxiety). Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. However, new and innovative technology is being used to deliver these psychological therapies remotely, meaning barriers to access to treatment such as distance and cost can be removed or reduced. Therapies delivered with technological devices, such as the Internet, computer-based programmes, smartphone applications, or via the telephone, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered remotely compared to waiting-list, treatment-as-usual, or active control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) from inception to June 2014 for randomised controlled trials of remotely delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries for potential trials. A citation and reference search for all included studies was conducted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All included studies were randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy delivered remotely via the Internet, smartphone device, computer-based programme, audiotapes, or over the phone in comparison to an active, treatment-as-usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and face-to-face interaction. We excluded interventions solely delivered face-to-face between therapist and patient from this review. Children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with a primary chronic pain condition were the target of the interventions. Each comparator arm, at each extraction point had to include 10 or more participants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For the analyses, we combined all psychological therapies. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain and analysed them separately. Pain, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse events were extracted as primary outcomes. We also extracted satisfaction with treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between 3 and 12 months (known as 'follow-up'). We assessed all included studies for risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies (N = 371) that delivered treatment remotely were identified from our search; five studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and two studies included mixed samples of children with headache and mixed (i.e. recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain) chronic pain conditions. The average age of children receiving treatment was 12.57 years.For headache pain conditions, we found one beneficial effect of remotely delivered psychological therapy. Headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.50, z = 3.62,p < 0.01, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2.88). For mixed pain conditions, we found only one beneficial effect: psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.61, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.25, z = 3.38, p < 0.01). No effects were found for reducing pain at follow-up in either analysis. For headache and mixed conditions, there were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analyses could be run. Only one analysis could be conducted for depression outcomes. We found no beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing depression post-treatment for headache conditions. Only one study presented data in children with mixed pain conditions for depressive outcomes and no data were available for either condition at follow-up. Only one study presented anxiety data post-treatment and no studies reported follow-up data, therefore no analyses could be run. Further, there were no data available for adverse events, meaning that we are unsure whether psychological therapies are harmful to children who receive them. Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively.'Risk of bias' assessments were low or unclear. We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low risk for included studies. However, judgements made on performance and attrition biases were mostly unclear. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Psychological therapies delivered remotely, primarily via the Internet, confer benefit in reducing the intensity or severity of pain after treatment across conditions. There is considerable uncertainty around these estimates of effect and only eight studies with 371 children contribute to the conclusions. Future studies are likely to change the conclusions reported here. All included trials used either behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapies for children with chronic pain, therefore we cannot generalise our findings to other therapies. However, satisfaction with these treatments was generally positive. Larger trials are needed to increase our confidence in all conclusions regarding the efficacy of remotely delivered psychological therapies. Implications for practice and research are discussed."
10.3389/fdgth.2025.1556468,The role of technology and screen media use in treatment outcomes of children participating in a digital mental health intervention: a retrospective analysis of Bend Health,"McAlister K, Lawrence-Sidebottom D, McCutchen D, Roots M, Huberty J.",Front Digit Health,2025,2025.5.19,,,"INTRODUCTION: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) show promise in improving children's mental health, but there is limited understanding of how technology and screen media influence treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to leverage retrospective data to explore the relationships of technology and screen media use with mental health symptoms among children participating in a pediatric DMHI. METHODS: Children ages 6-12 years who participated in a DMHI, Bend Health Inc, in the United States were included. Caregivers reported their child's screen media use and mental health symptoms every 30 days. Associations of screen media use with mental health symptoms were examined at baseline and throughout DMHI participation. RESULTS: Nearly all children (98.0%) used screen media, with 58.3% exhibiting problematic use and 23.2% showing elevated use at baseline. Elevated screen media use was associated with more severe depressive (z = 2.19, P = .022) and anxiety symptoms (z = 2.36, P = .019) at baseline, though associations differed by type. Video streaming, internet use, and gaming were linked to inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional behavior (P's < 0.05). While screen media use decreased for most children during care (93.1%), those with elevated use showed marginally greater improvements in anxiety (z = -1.87, P = .062) and inattention symptoms (z = -1.90, P = .058). DISCUSSION: Findings suggest a nuanced interaction between technology use and DMHIs. Future research should explore the specific contexts of screen media use to optimize DMHI effectiveness and address the potential adverse effects of certain screen media activities."
10.2196/50113,Patient and Therapist Perceptions of a Publicly Funded Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) Program for Ontario Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Study,"Thapar S, Nguyen M, Khan BN, Fanaieyan R, Kishimoto V, Liu R, Bolea-Alamañac B, Leon-Carlyle M, O'Riordan A, Keresteci M, Bhattacharyya O.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.2.19,,,"BACKGROUND: To address the anticipated rise in mental health symptoms experienced at the population level during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ontario government provided 2 therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs to adults free of charge at the point of service. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to explore the facilitators of and barriers to implementing iCBT at the population level in Ontario, Canada, from the perspective of patients and therapists to better understand how therapist-assisted iCBT programs can be effectively implemented at the population level and inform strategies for enhancing service delivery and integration into the health care system. METHODS: Using a convenience sampling methodology, semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 therapists who delivered iCBT and 20 patients who received iCBT through either of the publicly funded programs to explore their perspectives of the program. Interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis to generate themes. RESULTS: Six salient themes were identified. Facilitators included the therapist-assisted nature of the program; the ease of registration and the lack of cost; and the feasibility of completing the psychoeducational modules given the online and self-paced nature of the program. Barriers included challenges with the online remote modality for developing the therapeutic alliance; the program's generalized nature, which limited customization to individual needs; and a lack of formal integration between the iCBT program and the health care system. CONCLUSIONS: Although the program was generally well-received by patients and therapists due to its accessibility and feasibility, the digital format of the program presented both benefits and unique challenges. Strategies for improving the quality of service delivery include opportunities for synchronous communication between therapists and patients, options for increased customization, and the formal integration of iCBT into a broader stepped-care model that centralizes patient referrals between care providers and promotes continuity of care."
10.1016/j.sleep.2024.06.026,Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for people with comorbid psychological distress: A large scale randomized controlled trial,"Skoglund H, Sivertsen B, Kallestad H, Vedaa Ø.",Sleep Med,2024,2024.7.18,,,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine if comorbid anxiety and depression symptoms (psychological distress) moderate intervention effect in participants receiving digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (dCBT-I) in a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT), compared to a patient education (PE) control condition. Further, we investigate if dCBT-I reduced levels of psychological distress for those with insomnia and comorbid psychological distress. METHODS: 1721 participants with insomnia completed online assessments of sleep, fatigue and psychological distress, at baseline and at nine-week follow-up. Primary outcome was Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and secondary outcomes included self-reported sleep (diary), cognition, fatigue, and psychological distress. Participants with psychological distress (HADS>16) were separated from participants without psychological distress. Linear mixed models in SPSS were conducted to test the effects of the intervention. RESULTS: At nine-week follow-up we found no difference in effect of the intervention between those who had comorbid psychological distress vs. those without psychological distress in terms of insomnia severity (p = 0.552) and fatigue (p = 0.744). Both groups had large effect size improvements on insomnia severity (p < 0.001=), small to medium (Cohen d < 0.08) improvements on fatigue (p < 0.01=) and sleep efficiency (p < 0.001), and small improvement on other sleep diary measures, compared to their respective control group. The psychological distress group showed a small, but statistically significant decrease in psychological distress (d = 0.2, p < 0.05) with dCBT-I compared to PE. CONCLUSION: dCBT-I is a viable treatment for Insomnia also for those who have comorbid psychological distress."
10.2196/44922,The Impact of Social Media Use Interventions on Mental Well-Being: Systematic Review,"Plackett R, Blyth A, Schartau P.",J Med Internet Res,2023,2023.8.11,,,"BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that more social media use is related to poorer mental well-being and that social media use can become problematic when it starts to interfere with a person's daily life and mental well-being. To address this issue and improve users' mental well-being, social media use interventions (eg, abstinence from social media) have been developed and evaluated. However, there is limited understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions in improving mental well-being. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to synthesize the literature on the effectiveness of social media use interventions in improving mental well-being in adults. METHODS: A systematic search (January 1, 2004, to July 31, 2022) was completed across 3 databases in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Experimental studies evaluating the impact of social media use interventions on mental well-being in adults were included. Outcomes related to mental well-being, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness, were included. A narrative synthesis without meta-analysis was completed to summarize the study characteristics and effectiveness by outcome and intervention type. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool was used to measure the quality of the studies. RESULTS: Of the 2785 studies identified through the systematic search, 23 (0.83%) were included in the analysis. Many of the included studies (9/23, 39%) found improvements in mental well-being, some (7/23, 30%) found mixed effects, and others (7/23, 30%) found no effect on mental well-being. Therapy-based interventions that used techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy were more effective than limiting use of social media or full abstinence from social media, with 83% (5/6) of these studies showing improvements in mental well-being compared with 20% (1/5) and 25% (3/12), respectively. Depression was the most frequently investigated and improved outcome with 70% (7/10) of the studies showing a significant improvement in depression after the intervention, whereas other outcomes showed more varied results. Quality was poor, with 96% (22/23) of the studies receiving a weak global score, mostly for issues related to selection bias because most of the studies (16/23, 70%) used a convenience sampling of university students. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides some evidence that social media use interventions are effective in improving mental well-being, especially for depression and when using therapy-based interventions. Further experimental and longitudinal research is needed with representative samples to investigate who may benefit most from social media use interventions. This will help to develop guidance and recommendations for policy makers and clinicians on how best to manage problematic social media use."
10.1192/bjo.2023.519,A cognitive-behavioural therapy programme for managing depression and anxiety in long-term physical health conditions: mixed-methods real-world evaluation of the COMPASS programme,"Seaton N, Moss-Morris R, Hulme K, Macaulay H, Hudson J.",BJPsych Open,2023,2023.8.11,,,"BACKGROUND: Mental health comorbidities are common in physical long-term health conditions. AIMS: We evaluate the effectiveness of COMPASS, a therapist-supported, digital cognitive-behavioural therapy programme specifically designed to treat anxiety/depression in the context of long-term conditions. We also investigate patient experiences of the programme. METHOD: We utilised a mixed-methods, non-randomised design. We analysed pre-post data from 76 patients with long-term conditions who were receiving psychological treatment (COMPASS) via local NHS services, using paired sample t-tests and Cohen's d, with depression, anxiety, distress and functional impairment self-report scales. Qualitative interviews explored patients' experiences of using COMPASS. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews were completed and underwent inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Patients who received COMPASS had significantly reduced depression (-2.47, 95% CI -3.7 to -1.3, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.376), anxiety (-2.30, 95% CI -3.6 to -1.2, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.420) and psychological distress (-4.87, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.7, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.422) and significantly improved functional impairment (-3.00, 95% CI -4.8 to -1.2, P ≤ 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.282). Effect sizes were larger when analyses included only patients with clinically significant baseline symptoms: depression (-4.02, 95% CI -5.6 to -2.5, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.701), anxiety (-3.60, 95% CI -5.3 to -1.9, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.739), psychological distress (-5.58, 95% CI -7.9 to -3.2, P < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.523), functional impairment (-3.28, 95% CI -5.4 to -1.1, P ≤ 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.355). Qualitative analysis yielded two meta-themes: engagement and integration of mental and physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that COMPASS is effective in NHS settings, and is acceptable to patients. Content tailored to long-term conditions, therapist support and clear delivery strategies should be prioritised to aid intervention implementation."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the real-world voluntary use by college students of 4 digital, self-directed mental health modules based on a cognitive behavioral therapy clinical model. The findings were also compared with those of employee users. METHODS: Archival operational data from Learn to Live were extracted for student users at 4 colleges and universities in the Midwest region of the United States (N=951). The inclusion criteria were having clinical symptoms at established levels of moderate or higher severity and the use of 2 or more of the 8 lessons of a program within a 6-month period. Unique users in each program included 347 for depression; 325 for stress, anxiety, and worry; 203 for social anxiety; and 76 for insomnia. Paired t tests (two-tailed) compared the average level of change over time on a standardized measure of clinical symptoms appropriate to each program. Cohen d statistical effect sizes were calculated for each program. Potential moderator factors (age, gender, preliminary comprehensive assessment, number of lessons, duration, live coach support, and live teammate support) were tested together in repeated measures analysis of variance models with covariates in the full sample. Follow-up survey data (n=136) were also collected to explore user satisfaction and outcomes. Select data from another study of the same 4 programs by employee users meeting the same criteria (N=707) were examined for comparison. RESULTS: The percentage of users who improved to a clinical status of no longer being at risk after program use was as follows: stress, anxiety, and worry program (149/325, 45.8%); insomnia program (33/76, 43.4%), depression program (124/347, 35.7%); and social anxiety program (45/203, 22.2%). Significant improvements (all P<.001) over time were found in the mean scores for the clinical measures for each program: stress, anxiety, and worry (t324=16.21; d=1.25); insomnia (t75=6.85; d=1.10); depression (t346=12.71; d=0.91); and social anxiety (t202=8.33; d=0.80). Tests of the moderating factors across programs indicated that greater improvement was strongly associated with the use of more lessons and it also differed by program, by gender (males demonstrated more improvement than females), and by the use of live support (particularly coaching). Analyses of survey data found high satisfaction, improved academic outcomes, and successful integration into the university counseling ecosystem. The operational profile and outcomes of the college students were also similar to those of employee users of the same programs from our other study of employee users. Thus, this study provides a replication. CONCLUSIONS: Self-directed internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy mental health modules are promising as a supplement to traditional in-person counseling services provided by college counseling centers."

The objective of this study was to evaluate an evidence-based ICBT intervention for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD-NET) in three IAPT services in an open trial. METHODS: Consecutively referred patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n = 474) were offered OCD-NET. Symptoms of OCD, depression, anxiety, and level of functioning were measured weekly throughout treatment. RESULTS: In the full intention to treat sample (n = 474), the intervention was associated with large reductions in self-reported OCD symptoms (d = 1.77), anxiety (d = 1.55) and depression (d = 0.8), as well as improvements in functional impairment (d = 0.51 to 0.72). Further, 35% of participants were in recovery at their last assessment, 25% achieved reliable improvement and 15% met criteria for both recovery and improvement. Among participants completing at least 4 modules (n = 261), corresponding to an adequate 'dose' of treatment, the rates of recovery (44%), reliable improvement (34%) and reliable recovery (21%) were higher. A majority of participants were satisfied with the online treatment and found the online materials helpful. CONCLUSIONS: OCD-NET is an effective treatment when delivered in regular care within the IAPT system. Challenges associated with implementing ICBT in regular health care are discussed."
10.1007/s40120-021-00240-9,Patient and Provider Insights into the Impact of Multiple Sclerosis on Mental Health: A Narrative Review,"Davis BE, Lakin L, Binns CC, Currie KM, Rensel MR.",Neurol Ther,2021,2021.4.20,,,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, causing inflammation and neurodegeneration. People living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this process, including many ""invisible"" symptoms that are internally manifested and not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and self-management techniques for optimal mental health care."

However, there are few reports of the effectiveness of these PMPs when provided as part of routine care. METHODS: The present study sought to report the clinical and demographic characteristics of users (n = 1367) and examine the effectiveness of an established internet-delivered psychological PMP program in improving several pain-related outcomes, when offered at a national digital mental health service over a 5-year period. It also sought to comprehensively explore predictors of treatment commencement, treatment completion, and clinical improvement. RESULTS: Evidence of clinical improvements (% improvement; Hedges g) were found for all outcomes, including pain interference (18.9%; 0.55), depression (26.1%; 0.50), anxiety (23.9%; 0.39), pain intensity (12.8%; 0.41), pain self-efficacy (-23.8%; -0.46) and pain-catastrophizing (26.3%; 0.56). A small proportion of users enrolled but did not commence treatment (13%), however high levels of treatment completion (whole treatment = 63%; majority of the treatment = 75%) and satisfaction (very satisfied = 45%; satisfied = 37%) were observed among those who commenced treatment. There were a number of demographic and clinical factors associated with commencement, completion and improvement, but no decisive or dominant predictors were observed. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the effectiveness and acceptability of internet-delivered psychological PMPs in routine care and point to the need to consider how best to integrate these interventions into the pathways of care for people with chronic pain."

We identified five core behaviours required to maintain good mental health. We also found that psychological assessment and treatment provided remotely was relatively safe.ConclusionsDMHS are accessible, effective, efficient and relatively safe. As well as supporting quality control and service evaluation, the routine measurement of outcomes by DMHS has improved our understanding of the nature of common mental disorders."

This article describes a patient-oriented adaptation approach used to address this gap in research. A working group consisting of people with lived experience, community representatives, ICBT clinicians, managers, and researchers was formed. The working group examined archival feedback on ICBT from past patients who self-identified as being from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds (N = 278) and the results of interviews with current patients (N = 16), community representatives (N = 6), and clinicians (N = 3). The archival data and interviews revealed the majority of the patients reported being satisfied with and benefitting from ICBT. Suggestions for improvement were not related to the cognitive-behavioural model and techniques, but rather to making treatment materials more inclusive. Consequently, the ICBT adaptation focused on adding content related to cultural influences on mental health, addressing stigma, diversifying case stories, examples, and imagery, adding audiovisual introductions, and replacing English idioms with more descriptive language. Moreover, further training was offered to clinicians, and efforts were made to improve community outreach. This study demonstrates a process for using patient-oriented research to improve ICBT within routine care serving patients of diverse backgrounds."

These figures underline the widespread concerns in our society regarding the potential dangers and risks associated with Internet and digital media use. METHODS: Selective literature search for records on Internet-related disorders in children and adolescents. RESULTS: Internet-related disorders are now viewed as belonging to the behavioral addiction. Research has revealed similarities to substance-related disorders. There are often associations with other mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders, as well as disturbed sleep patterns, increased risk taking, nicotine abuse, an unbalanced diet, and lack of exercise. Female adolescents are statistically significantly more often affected than male adolescents (7.1% versus 4.5%). The German STICA study, the first randomized controlled trial worldwide, demonstrated that cognitive behavioral therapy was effective compared with a waiting group (odds ratio 10.10, 95% confidence interval [3.69; 27.65]). CONCLUSION: Internet-related disorders have not yet been conclusively conceptualized and operationalized. Further work is urgently required to refine the concepts of both the illness and and its treatment."

We surveyed 276 community mental health providers registered with a commercial telemedicine platform. Most providers reported primarily offering TMH services to adults with anxiety, depression, and trauma-and stressor-related disorders in individual therapy formats. Approximately 82% of TMH providers reported endorsing the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in their remote practice. The most commonly used in-session and between-session (i.e., homework) exercises included coping and emotion regulation, problem solving, mindfulness, interpersonal skills, relaxation, and modifying and addressing core beliefs. CBT TMH providers had a higher odds of using in-session and homework exercises and assigning them through postal mail, email or fax methods, as compared to non-CBT TMH providers. TMH providers, regardless of treatment paradigm, felt that assigning homework was neither easy nor difficult and they believed their patients were somewhat-to-moderately compliant to their assigned exercises. CBT TMH providers also collected clinical information from their patients more often than non-CBT TMH providers. They reported being less satisfied with their method, which was identified most often as paper-based surveys and forms. Overall, TMH providers employ evidence-based treatments to their patients remotely, with CBT TMH providers most likely to do so. Findings highlight the need for innovative solutions to improve how TMH providers that endorse following the CBT treatment paradigm remotely assign homework and collect clinical data to increase their satisfaction via telemedicine."

This cycle of association has prompted a recommendation for psychological treatment of chronic pain to target mechanisms for emotion regulation. The current trial addressed this need by investigating a new internet-delivered treatment incorporating emotional skills training from dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). Using a single-case experimental design that is suited to heterogeneous populations and can demonstrate efficacy with a small sample, three participants with chronic pain were recruited. Participants received four weeks of online DBT skills training (iDBT-Pain intervention) which incorporated one-on-one sessions over Zoom and a web app. Results revealed compelling evidence for the intervention on the primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and were promising for the secondary outcome of pain intensity. Improvement was also identified on pre-and post-measures of depression, coping behaviors, sleep problems, wellbeing, and harm avoidance, indicating that the intervention may positively influence other factors related to chronic pain. Overall, the trial provides preliminary efficacy for the intervention to improve chronic pain. However, we recommend further investigation of the iDBT-Pain intervention, either in single case trials, which when conducted with scientific rigor may be aggregated to derive nomothetic conclusions, or in a group-comparison trial to compare with usual modes of treatment. PERSPECTIVE: This trial advances understanding of emotion-focused treatment for chronic pain and provides evidence for a viable new technological treatment. Importantly, as an internet-delivered approach, the iDBT-Pain intervention is accessible to those with restricted mobility and remote communities where there are often limited psychological services for people with chronic pain."

Unfortunately, nearly 1 in 3 survivors experience anxiety symptoms as a long-term consequence of cancer and its treatment. Characterized by restlessness, muscle tension, and worry, anxiety worsens the quality of life; impairs daily functioning; and is associated with poor sleep, depressed mood, and fatigue. Although pharmacological treatment options are available, polypharmacy has become a growing concern for cancer survivors. Music therapy (MT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are evidence-based, nonpharmacological treatments that have demonstrated effectiveness in treating anxiety symptoms in cancer populations and can be adapted for remote delivery to increase access to mental health treatments. However, the comparative effectiveness of these 2 interventions delivered via telehealth is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the Music Therapy Versus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Cancer-related Anxiety (MELODY) study are to determine the comparative effectiveness of telehealth-based MT versus telehealth-based CBT for anxiety and comorbid symptoms in cancer survivors and to identify patient-level factors associated with greater anxiety symptom reduction for MT and CBT. METHODS: The MELODY study is a 2-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial that aims to compare the effectiveness of MT versus CBT for anxiety and comorbid symptoms. The trial will enroll 300 English- or Spanish-speaking survivors of any cancer type or stage who have experienced anxiety symptoms for at least 1 month. Participants will receive 7 weekly sessions of MT or CBT delivered remotely via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) over 7 weeks. Validated instruments to assess anxiety (primary outcome), comorbid symptoms (fatigue, depression, insomnia, pain, and cognitive dysfunction), and health-related quality of life will be administered at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 (end of treatment), 16, and 26. Semistructured interviews will be conducted at week 8 with a subsample of 60 participants (30 per treatment arm) to understand individual experiences with the treatment sessions and their impact. RESULTS: The first study participant was enrolled in February 2022. As of January 2023, 151 participants have been enrolled. The trial is expected to be completed by September 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first and largest randomized clinical trial to compare the short- and long-term effectiveness of remotely delivered MT and CBT for anxiety in cancer survivors. Limitations include the lack of usual care or placebo control groups and the lack of formal diagnostic assessments for psychiatric disorders among trial participants. The study findings will help guide treatment decisions for 2 evidence-based, scalable, and accessible interventions to promote mental well-being during cancer survivorship.

10.1002/eat.24405,Mental Health Impacts of Self-Help Interventions for the Treatment and Prevention of Eating Disorders. A Meta-Analysis,"Linardon J, Jarman HK, Liu C, Anderson C, McClure Z, Messer M.",Int J Eat Disord,2025,2025.3.3,,,"OBJECTIVE: Self-help programs are recommended as a first step in the management of eating disorders. Yet, whether self-help interventions have broader mental health benefits beyond symptom and risk reduction remains unclear. As randomized controlled trials (RCTs) also assess general mental health secondary to eating disorder symptoms, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether and to what extent pure self-help interventions for eating disorders produce improvements in these secondary outcomes. METHOD: Twenty-seven RCTs of pure self-help interventions for the prevention or treatment of eating disorders were included. Mean age ranged from 16 to 46 years. Most self-help interventions were based on cognitive-behavioral therapy. Most interventions were delivered via digital means (Internet, apps, etc.). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on six outcomes: depression, anxiety, general distress, quality of life, self-esteem, and psychosocial impairment. Analyses were stratified based on pre-selected (at risk/symptomatic) and clinical samples. RESULTS: For pre-selected samples (k = 18), significant pooled effects favoring self-help over controls were observed for depression (g = 0.24), anxiety (g = 0.23), distress (g = 0.23) and self-esteem (g = 0.18). Effects remained robust when adjusting for risk of bias. Non-significant effects were observed for quality of life and impairment. Crucially, > 80% of trials on pre-selected samples delivered a waitlist control. For clinical samples (k = 9), significant pooled effects favoring self-help were found for distress (g = 0.39), impairment (g = 0.39), and quality of life (g = 0.29), although these results should be interpreted with caution as the number of studies was low. CONCLUSION: Self-help interventions produce small improvements in those mental health symptoms that are typically comorbid with eating disorders."

The intervention aimed to support men manage active surveillance-related psychological distress. METHODS: The person-based approach (PBA) was used as the overarching guiding methodological framework for intervention development. Evidence-based methods were incorporated to improve robustness. The process commenced with data gathering activities comprising the following four components: • A systematic review and meta-analysis of depression and anxiety in prostate cancer • A cross-sectional survey on depression and anxiety in active surveillance • A review of existing interventions in the field • A qualitative study with the target audience The purpose of this paper is to bring these components together and describe how they facilitated the establishment of key guiding principles and a logic model, which underpinned the first draft of the intervention. RESULTS: The prototype intervention, named PROACTIVE, consists of six Internet-based sessions run concurrently with three group support sessions. The sessions cover the following topics: lifestyle (diet and exercise), relaxation and resilience techniques, talking to friends and family, thoughts and feelings, daily life (money and work) and information about prostate cancer and active surveillance. The resulting intervention has been trialled in a feasibility study, the results of which are published elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: The planning and development process is key to successful delivery of an appropriate, accessible and acceptable intervention. The PBA strengthened the intervention by drawing on target-user experiences to maximise acceptability and user engagement. This meticulous description in a clinical setting using this rigorous but flexible method is a useful demonstration for others developing similar interventions.

METHODS: An individually randomised, group treatment design with computer-generated block randomisation was used. Between May 2021-April 2022, 182 adults with a Distress Questionnaire-5 score = ≥8 (indicative depression) were recruited from a tertiary mental health service in regional Victoria, Australia and surrounds. Participants were assigned to six 90-min sessions over 8-weeks using group-based, online videoconferencing comprising: (1) lifestyle therapy (targeting nutrition, physical activity) with a dietitian and exercise physiologist (n = 91) or (2) psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) with psychologists (n = 91). The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression at 8-weeks (non-inferiority margin ≤2) using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE). Cost-minimisation analysis estimated the mean difference in total costs from health sector and societal perspectives. Outcomes were assessed by blinded research assistants using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews. Results are presented per-protocol (PP) and Intention to Treat (ITT) using beta coefficients with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: The sample was 80% women (mean: 45-years [SD:13.4], mean PHQ-9:10.5 [SD:5.7]. An average 4.2 of 6 sessions were completed, with complete data for n = 132.

Three serious adverse events were recorded. While lifestyle therapy was delivered at lower cost, there were no differences in total costs (health sector adjusted mean difference: PP AUD$156 [95% CIs -$182, $611, ITT AUD$190 [95% CIs -$155, $651] ]; societal adjusted mean difference: PP AUD$350 [95% CIs:-$222, $1152] ITT AUD$ 408 [95% CIs -$139, $1157]. INTERPRETATION: Remote-delivered lifestyle therapy was non-inferior to psychotherapy with respect to clinical and cost outcomes. If replicated in a fully powered RCT, this approach could increase access to allied health professionals who, with adequate training and guidelines, can deliver mental healthcare at comparable cost to psychologists. FUNDING: This trial was funded by the Australian Medical Research Future Fund (GA133346) under its Covid-19 Mental Health Research Grant Scheme."
10.2196/31293,Effectiveness of Videoconference-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adults With Psychiatric Disorders: Systematic and Meta-Analytic Review,"Matsumoto K, Hamatani S, Shimizu E.",J Med Internet Res,2021,2021.12.13,,,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard of psychotherapy for psychiatric disorders. However, the format of delivering CBT in person limits access to the intervention. The advancements in information and communication technology, especially the internet, present an opportunity for cognitive behavioral therapists to service patients or clients in remote areas through videoconferencing. Although many randomized controlled trials of videoconference-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (VCBT) have already been conducted, the overall estimated effect size of VCBT for psychiatric disorders has not been examined by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of VCBT for psychiatric disorders through a systematic and meta-analytic review. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in which VCBT was directly compared to control groups (such as treatment as usual, attention control, wait-list control, and other minimal supports) was carried out. To identify previous studies that meet our study objective, 2 independent reviewers undertook a systematic search through seven databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Science Direct, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and SciELO. Other databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Resister of Controlled Trials) were also checked. All studies included in the review were assessed using the quality criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. Statistical analysis was performed by using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4.0). Standardized mean difference was used in major meta-analyses where a P value of .05 or less was the threshold for statistical significance. A heterogeneity test and the chi-square test were performed to assess the presence and extent of statistical heterogeneity with significance set at P<.10. Funnel plots were visually inspected to assess the risk of bias. Subgroup analyses were conducted for each disorder to estimate intervention effects. RESULTS: The systematic search resulted in 16 studies (total N=1745) that met the criteria for this study and were included in the review. There were 10 studies on depressive symptoms, 3 on chronic pain, 1 on generalized anxiety disorder, 1 on obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 1 on hypochondriasis. The quality and risk of bias was also assessed. Results showed a pooled effect size (Hedge g) post treatment of -0.49 (95% CI -0.68 to -0.29), indicating that VCBT is effective for clients with psychiatric disorders. Study quality did not affect outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall results indicate the effectiveness of VCBT, there are still only a limited number of studies on specific psychiatric and somatic conditions. Therefore, more randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of VCBT for different disorders.

Recent research on the effectiveness of self-help internet-based CBT (ICBT) indicates that the paradigm moderately improves psychological problems. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that food and drinks containing supplements improve various health conditions. We investigated the effect of a brief self-help ICBT administered with a supplement drink on psychological well-being and somatic symptoms. METHODS: In total, 101 healthy workers were enrolled in the 4-week ICBT program, which consisted of psychoeducation on stress management, behavior activation, and cognitive restructuring. The supplement soft drink was taken every day during the program. The participants were instructed to watch on-demand video clips and read the self-help guidebook and supporting comic strip weekly on the Internet or smartphone. The Japanese version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) was administered before and after completion of the program. Scores on the POMS tension-anxiety (POMS-TA), depression (POMS-D), and fatigue (POMS-F) subscales were used to assess the effect of the program. Somatic symptoms were assessed using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 75 participants continued the program for 4 weeks; however, of those, 27 failed to complete all weekly tasks or meet the post-assessment deadlines. Therefore, the data of 48 participants were included in the analysis. Pre-post intervention comparisons using paired t-tests revealed significant improvement on the POMS-TA, but not the POMS-D or POMS-F subscales. Moreover, participants reported a significant reduction in the severity of low back pain. CONCLUSION: Our brief intervention moderately improved anxiety levels and the symptom of low back pain. These findings suggest that the brief ICBT program is effective in non-patient populations. Future directions for brief ICBT are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered on February 10, 2016 at UMIN. The registration number is UMIN000020962."

Prevalence rates of 20-45% are reported globally for insomnia symptoms during the pandemic. Affected populations include the public and health care workers. A sleep deprived society faces the increased burden of COVID-related economic disruption, psychosocial problems, substance abuse, and suicide. Disordered sleep is not expected to disappear with control of infection, making interventions acutely necessary. The question becomes how to manage the sleep dysfunction during and after the pandemic. Depression and anxiety are prominent complaints during pandemic restrictions. Insomnia symptoms and fatigue continue even as mood improves in those who are in recovery from COVID-19 infection. Management of disturbed sleep and mental health is particularly needed in frontline health care workers. This overview describes 53 publications, as of February 2021, on disturbed sleep during the pandemic, treatment studies on COVID-related sleep disturbance, and need to rely on current treatment guidelines for common sleep disorders. The available research during the first year of COVID-19 has generally described symptoms of poor sleep rather than addressing treatment strategies. It covers digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) for the public and frontline workers, recognizing the need of greater acceptance and efficacy of controlled trials of CBT for affected groups. Recommendations based on a tiered public health model are discussed."

E-mental health has the potential to enhance the quality of care and can be swiftly implemented on a large scale. We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews, including meta-analyses, to assess the effects of COVID-19 e-mental health interventions. We followed an established search, screening, coding, and reporting protocol. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) checklist. The searches resulted in a total of 2341 articles. Of these, twelve systematic and meta-analytic reviews were included. The findings indicated that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation were the most used mental health intervention types. E-mental health interventions were delivered via various communication channels including videoconferencing, telephone-based approaches, and mobile applications. E-mental health interventions have demonstrated their effectiveness in addressing prevalent mental health issues, particularly anxiety, depression, and stress. This study underscores the importance of e-mental health interventions in enhancing accessibility and efficiency to reduce mental health symptoms, providing valuable insights for policymakers and clinicians addressing mental health challenges exacerbated by global pandemics."
10.1093/tbm/ibz043,"Feasibility of pediatric obesity and prediabetes treatment support through Tess, the AI behavioral coaching chatbot","Stephens TN, Joerin A, Rauws M, Werk LN.",Transl Behav Med,2019,2019.5.17,,,"Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through various media, including Internet interventions, mobile apps, and video games. BITs present several possible benefits, including increased dissemination and accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, and decreased stigma, especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot, Tess, addresses different facets of behavioral health, such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7, Tess delivers customized integrative support, psychoeducation, and interventions through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e., SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23; Mage = 15.20 years; Rangeage = 9.78-18.54 years; 57% female) coping with weight management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to promote treatment adherence, behavior change, and overall wellness. Adolescent patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the time. The 4,123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings (96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of support through artificial intelligence, specifically in a pediatric setting, which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to clinicians, Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous learning, future iterations may have additional features to increase the user experience."

For some people this feeling may become a sustained state that is associated with a wide range of psychiatric and psychosocial problems. While there are few existing treatment protocols, interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have shown positive effects. The current study investigated the efficacy of an 8-week internet-based treatment containing CBT components aimed at reducing feelings of loneliness. Seventy-three participants were recruited from the general public and randomly allocated to treatment or a wait-list control condition. Participants were assessed with standardized self-report measures of loneliness, depression, social anxiety, worry, and quality of life at pretreatment and posttreatment. Robust linear regression analysis of all randomized participants showed significant treatment effects on the primary outcome measure of loneliness (between group Cohen's d = 0.77), and on secondary outcomes measuring quality of life and social anxiety relative to control at postassessment. The results suggest the potential utility of internet-based CBT in alleviating loneliness but more research on the long-term effects and the mechanisms underlying the effects is needed."

METHOD: Nested within a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, 241 participants received an 8-week supported iCBT intervention for anxiety and/or depression and answered open-ended questions about their use and experience of CBT skills at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up. Recurrent, cross-sectional qualitative analysis following the descriptive and interpretive approach was used to create a taxonomy, through which all qualitative data was coded. RESULTS: In total, 479 qualitative responses across 181 participants were analysed. Participants reported using a wide range of CBT skills and associated helpful and hindering experiences and impacts. The reasons for discontinued CBT skills usage were diverse, ranging from rare adverse effects to healthy adaptation. CONCLUSION: The study shows how clients receiving iCBT in routine care learn CBT skills during treatment and utilize them in productive ways post-treatment. Findings coincide with similar research in face-to-face CBT and may inform future research to drive innovation and iCBT intervention development."

We developed an internet-administered, guided, low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy-based self-help intervention (EJDeR) for parents delivered on the U-CARE-portal (Portal). The acceptability and feasibility of EJDeR and study procedures were examined using a single-arm feasibility trial (ENGAGE). Results indicated that EJDeR and ENGAGE study procedures are acceptable and feasible, however, a need for clinical and technical modifications to EJDeR and refinements to ENGAGE study procedures was identified. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of EJDeR and ENGAGE study procedures from the perspective of e-therapists to inform clinical and technical modifications to EJDeR and refinements to study procedures prior to progression to a superiority randomised controlled trial. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 e-therapists. Data were analysed using manifest content analysis. RESULTS: We identified three categories relating to the acceptability and feasibility of EJDeR: (a) Support to e-therapists (subcategories: Clinical supervision and Technical difficulties); (b) Guidance to parents (subcategories: Support protocols and Synchronous communication); and (c) Content (subcategories: Relevancy of the intervention and Pacing of the intervention). We identified four categories relating to the acceptability and feasibility of study procedures: (a) Recruitment and training of e-therapists (subcategories: Definition of the role and Training program); (b) Retention of parents (subcategories: Parent suitability and screening and Frequency of weekly Portal assessments); (c) Retention of e-therapists (subcategories: Administrative requirements and Communication with the research team); and (d) The Portal. CONCLUSIONS: EJDeR and study procedures were considered acceptable and feasible, however, clinical and technical modifications and refinements to study procedures were suggested to enhance acceptability and feasibility. Results may also inform implementation considerations for both EJDeR and other similar digital psychological interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 57233429."
10.1093/sleep/zsab118,The effect of sleep-wake intraindividual variability in digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: a mediation analysis of a large-scale RCT,"Vestergaard CL, Vedaa Ø, Simpson MR, Faaland P, Vethe D, Kjørstad K, Langsrud K, Ritterband LM, Sivertsen B, Stiles TC, Scott J, Kallestad H.",Sleep,2021,2021.5.8,,,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) is an effective treatment for insomnia. However, less is known about mediators of its benefits. The aim of the present study was to test if intraindividual variability in sleep (IIV) was reduced with dCBT-I, and whether any identified reduction was a mediator of dCBT-I on insomnia severity and psychological distress. METHODS: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), 1720 adults with insomnia (dCBT-I = 867; patient education about sleep = 853) completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and sleep diaries, at baseline and 9-week follow-up. Changes in IIV were analyzed using linear mixed modeling followed by mediation analyses of ISI, HADS, and IIV in singular sleep metrics and composite measures (behavioral indices (BI-Z) and sleep disturbance indices (SI-Z)). RESULTS: dCBT-I was associated with reduced IIV across all singular sleep metrics, with the largest between-group effect sizes observed for sleep onset latency (SOL). Reduced IIV for SOL and wake after sleep onset had the overall greatest singular mediating effect. For composite measures, SI-Z mediated change in ISI (b = -0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.04 to -0.52; 13.3%) and HADS (b = -0.40; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.18; 29.2%), while BI-Z mediated minor changes. CONCLUSION: Reductions in IIV in key sleep metrics mediate significant changes in insomnia severity and especially psychological distress when using dCBT-I. These findings offer important evidence regarding the therapeutic action of dCBT-I and may guide the future development of this intervention.

However, digital programs with human moderation are unlikely to be disseminated widely. The aim of this study was to test whether a chatbot (i.e., computer program simulating human conversation) would significantly reduce ED risk factors (i.e., weight/shape concerns, thin-ideal internalization) in women at high risk for an ED, compared to waitlist control, as well as whether it would significantly reduce overall ED psychopathology, depression, and anxiety and prevent ED onset. METHOD: Women who screened as high risk for an ED were randomized (N = 700) to (1) chatbot based on the StudentBodies© program; or (2) waitlist control. Participants were followed for 6 months. RESULTS: For weight/shape concerns, there was a significantly greater reduction in intervention versus control at 3- (d = -0.20; p = .03) and 6-m-follow-up (d = -0.19; p = .04). There were no differences in change in thin-ideal internalization. The intervention was associated with significantly greater reductions than control in overall ED psychopathology at 3- (d = -0.29; p = .003) but not 6-month follow-up. There were no differences in change in depression or anxiety. The odds of remaining nonclinical for EDs were significantly higher in intervention versus control at both 3- (OR = 2.37, 95% CI [1.37, 4.11]) and 6-month follow-ups (OR = 2.13, 95% CI [1.26, 3.59]). DISCUSSION: Findings provide support for the use of a chatbot-based EDs prevention program in reducing weight/shape concerns through 6-month follow-up, as well as in reducing overall ED psychopathology, at least in the shorter-term. Results also suggest the intervention may reduce ED onset. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: We found that a chatbot, or a computer program simulating human conversation, based on an established, cognitive-behavioral therapy-based eating disorders prevention program, was successful in reducing women's concerns about weight and shape through 6-month follow-up and that it may actually reduce eating disorder onset. These findings are important because this intervention, which uses a rather simple text-based approach, can easily be disseminated in order to prevent these deadly illnesses.

10.7717/peerj.17491,Cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia and mindfulness-based stress reduction in nurses with insomnia: a non-inferiority internet delivered randomized controlled trial,"Guo W, Nazari N, Sadeghi M.",PeerJ,2024,2024.7.29,,,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a highly prevalent sleep disorder frequently comorbid with mental health conditions in nurses. Despite the effectiveness of evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), there is a critical need for alternative approaches. This study investigated whether internet-delivered mindfulness-based stress reduction (IMBSR) for insomnia could be an alternative to internet-delivered CBT-I (ICBT-I). OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was that the IMBSR would be noninferior to the ICBT-I in reducing the severity of insomnia among nurses with insomnia. Additionally, it was expected that ICBT-I would produce a greater reduction in the severity of insomnia and depression than IMBSR. METHOD: Among 240 screened nurses, 134 with insomnia were randomly allocated (IMBSR, n = 67; ICBT-I, n = 67). The assessment protocol comprised clinical interviews and self-reported outcome measures, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the 15-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-I). RESULTS: The retention rate was 55% with 77.6% (n = 104) of participants completing the study. At post-intervention, the noninferiority analysis of the ISI score showed that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was 4.88 (P = 0.46), surpassing the pre-specified noninferiority margin of 4 points. Analysis of covariance revealed that the ICBT-I group had significantly lower ISI (Cohen's d = 1.37) and PHQ-9 (Cohen's d = 0.71) scores than did the IMBSR group. In contrast, the IMBSR group showed a statistically significant increase in the FFMQ-15 score (Cohen's d = 0.67). Within-group differences showed that both the IMBSR and ICBT-I were effective at reducing insomnia severity and depression severity and improving mindfulness. CONCLUSION: Overall, nurses demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and adherence to both interventions. The IMBSR significantly reduced insomnia severity and depression, but the findings of this study do not provide strong evidence that the IMBSR is at least as effective as the ICBT-I in reducing insomnia symptoms among nurses with insomnia. The ICBT-I was found to be significantly superior to the IMBSR in reducing insomnia severity, making it a recommended treatment option for nurses with insomnia."
10.2196/29258,Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Comorbid With Chronic Pain: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Wiklund T, Molander P, Lindner P, Andersson G, Gerdle B, Dragioti E.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.4.29,,,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain often experience insomnia symptoms. Pain initiates, maintains, and exacerbates insomnia symptoms, and vice versa, indicating a complex situation with an additional burden for these patients. Hence, the evaluation of insomnia-related interventions for patients with chronic pain is important. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (ICBT-i) for reducing insomnia severity and other sleep- and pain-related parameters in patients with chronic pain. Participants were recruited from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation. METHODS: We included 54 patients (mean age 49.3, SD 12.3 years) who were randomly assigned to the ICBT-i condition and 24 to an active control condition (applied relaxation). Both treatment conditions were delivered via the internet. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a sleep diary, and a battery of anxiety, depression, and pain-related parameter measurements were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up (only ISI, anxiety, depression, and pain-related parameters). For the ISI and sleep diary, we also recorded weekly measurements during the 5-week treatment. Negative effects were also monitored and reported. RESULTS: Results showed a significant immediate interaction effect (time by treatment) on the ISI and other sleep parameters, namely, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, early morning awakenings, and wake time after sleep onset. Participants in the applied relaxation group reported no significant immediate improvements, but both groups exhibited a time effect for anxiety and depression at the 6-month follow-up. No significant improvements on pain-related parameters were found. At the 6-month follow-up, both the ICBT-i and applied relaxation groups had similar sleep parameters. For both treatment arms, increased stress was the most frequently reported negative effect. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic pain, brief ICBT-i leads to a more rapid decline in insomnia symptoms than does applied relaxation. As these results are unique, further research is needed to investigate the effect of ICBT-i on a larger sample size of people with chronic pain. Using both treatments might lead to an even better outcome in patients with comorbid insomnia and chronic pain.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia and anxiety are highly prevalent and frequently co-occur. Given limited therapeutic resources and time constraints, the aim of this study was to compare which treatment-internet cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia or internet CBT for anxiety-leads to the best outcomes in individuals with comorbid insomnia and anxiety. METHODS: 120 participants with comorbid insomnia and clinical anxiety (as defined by scores above the clinical cutoff on the insomnia severity index (ISI) and the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)) were randomized to receive internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for insomnia or iCBT for anxiety. The primary outcome measures were the ISI and the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale. Primary outcome measures were assessed before treatment, at mid-treatment, at post-treatment, and 3 months after treatment. Secondary outcome measures assessed depression symptoms, distress, and sleep diary parameters. RESULTS: Participants in both groups experienced large reductions in symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress, as well as improvements in sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. Crucially, at the end of treatment, the insomnia treatment was more effective in reducing symptoms of insomnia than the anxiety treatment, and equally effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up, however, there were no differences between groups at that time point. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in the common case of a patient presenting with comorbid insomnia and anxiety, treatment for insomnia may be the most efficient treatment strategy.

Secondary aims were to identify the effects on additional difficulties associate with tinnitus and any unwanted events related to ICBT for tinnitus. METHODS: A repeated-measures design with 4 time points was used. Participants previously undertaking two randomized ICBT efficacy trials for tinnitus in the US were invited to participate. Of the 200 invited, 132 (66 %) completed the 1-year follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress from baseline at one year post-intervention, as assessed by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary assessment measures were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, hearing disability, hyperacusis, tinnitus cognitions and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Undertaking ICBT for tinnitus led to significant improvements 1-year post-intervention for tinnitus severity, with a large effect size (d = 1.06; CI: 0.80 to 1.32). Medium effects were found for anxiety (d = 0.54; CI: 0.29 to 0.79), depression (d = 0.46; CI: 0.21 to 0.70), insomnia (d = 0.47; CI: 0.22 to 0.72), and tinnitus cognitions (d = 0.43, CI: 0.18 to 0.68). Small effect sizes were found for hearing disability, hyperacusis and health-related quality of life. Adverse events related to the intervention were only reported by 1 participant. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of audiologist-guided ICBT for tinnitus and tinnitus-related difficulties were maintained 1-year post-intervention with very few adverse events reported. Ways of disseminate evidence-based easily accessible interventions to the general population with bothersome tinnitus should be sought."

10.1177/15346501211018278,Transitioning Transdiagnostic CBT from Face-to-Face to Telephone Delivery During the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Case Study,"Saunders J, Allen C.",Clin Case Stud,2021,2024.4.11,,,"The coronavirus pandemic led to worldwide disruption in the delivery of face-to-face mental health services. This impact was marked for individuals with long-term health conditions and comorbid depression and anxiety. Many face-to-face mental health services switched to remote delivery or paused therapeutic input entirely, despite the lack of research on the efficacy of switching between modalities mid-therapy or having breaks in therapy. This paper presents the case of a patient with long-term health conditions who experienced both breaks in therapy and a switch in modalities from face-to-face to telephone delivery. The intervention used was based on transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy and self-report measures were completed at the beginning and end of the twelve sessions. Despite the shift in modalities, the patient experienced clinically significant recovery on all measures, indicating the efficacy of therapy was not greatly affected by the shift in modalities. Long breaks in therapy were linked to deterioration in mental health, although this could be due to the deterioration in physical health that necessitated these breaks. This case highlights the benefits and challenges of a shifting modality of therapy during treatment and in response to a pandemic for a shielding population. From the work presented here, it seems beneficial for services to be able to work across multiple modalities to suit the needs of the patients and ensure continuity of treatment. It also indicates that pauses in therapy may risk deterioration. Further work is needed to prevent digital exclusion of patients."

To increase accessibility, ICBT was translated into Spanish. This study's objective was to determine the feasibility of ICBT for Spanish speakers. DESIGN: A single-group pre-test post-test design was used. Compliance, engagement, acceptance and outcome feasibility were measured. STUDY SAMPLE: Forty-six Spanish speakers with tinnitus were screened. There were 32 participants meeting the eligibility criteria, with a mean age of 47 (±11) years. Of these 91% were Hispanic or Latino with 66% living in Spain and 34% living in South America. RESULTS: Outcome feasibility was established, as a large pre- and post-test within-group effect size of d = 0.90 was found for tinnitus severity. Large pre- and post-test effect sizes were also present for the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression with a medium effect for insomnia, health-related quality of life, and tinnitus cognitions. Intervention engagement and compliance were not optimal although no participants withdrew. Intervention acceptance rates indicated scope for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: ICBT for Spanish communities appears to be feasible. A randomised controlled trial is required to further investigate the effects and identify ways of improving engagement and attracting Spanish speakers from different countries."

Moreover, to expand the data supporting the efficacy of MCP for cancer patients, it would be necessary to compare MCP to other active therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). METHODS: The aims of the proposed study are: the first objective is to verify the efficacy of the MCP intervention for Spanish participants with cancer in a randomized control trial (RCT) comparing it to CBT. The second objective is to analyze the feasibility and acceptance of MCP in Spanish participants with cancer. The third objective is to analyze whether the changes produced in the meaning in life dimensions (presence, search, comprehension, purpose, and mattering) will predict changes in anxiety, depression, quality of life, etc. Our research team adapted MCP for Spanish participants with cancer. This paper presents the study protocol. The study design consists of a two-arm RCT with two conditions: MCP and CBT, where participants will be randomized to one of the two groups. Eligible participants will be adults with stage I, II, and III cancer who were treated with curative intent and had completed their main medical treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy). Participants will be assessed at pretreatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. The intention-to-treat principle will be used when analyzing data, using mixed-effects models with full information and maximum likelihood estimation. DISCUSSION: This study will provide results that confirm the efficacy of the MCP in Spanish participants with cancer.

10.2196/70874,The Effectiveness of a Chatbot Single-Session Intervention for People on Waitlists for Eating Disorder Treatment: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Sharp G, Dwyer B, Randhawa A, McGrath I, Hu H.",J Med Internet Res,2025,2025.5.21,,,"BACKGROUND: Early treatment is critical for improving eating disorder prognosis. Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI (Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot's impact on eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all types of eating disorders. METHODS: This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group (n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology (primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention group only. RESULTS: ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in participants' confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The chatbot was rated as ""excellent"" in terms of usability. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30). CONCLUSIONS: ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI.

10.1093/tbm/ibae032,Impact of an internet-based insomnia intervention on suicidal ideation and associated correlates in veterans at elevated suicide risk,"Nazem S, Sun S, Barnes SM, Monteith LL, Hostetter TA, Forster JE, Brenner LA, Galfalvy H, Haghighi F.",Transl Behav Med,2024,2024.6.12,,,"Improving public health approaches to suicide prevention requires scalable evidence-based interventions that can be easily disseminated. Given empirical data supporting the association between insomnia and suicide risk, internet-delivered insomnia interventions are promising candidates to meet this need. The purpose of this study was to examine whether an unguided internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) improved insomnia severity, suicidal ideation (SI), and suicide risk correlates (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, hostility, belongingness, hopelessness, agitation, irritability, concentration) in a sample of veterans. Secondary data analysis of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn veterans (n = 50) with clinically significant insomnia and elevated SI drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an iCBT-I, Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi). Two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to evaluate between-group differences (SHUTi vs. Insomnia Education Website control) in symptom improvement from baseline to post-intervention. SHUTi participants experienced a significant improvement in insomnia severity (P < .001; d = -1.08) and a non-significant with small (subthreshold medium) effect size reduction of SI (P = .17, d = 0.40), compared to control participants. Significant improvement in hopelessness was observed (medium effect size), with non-significant small to medium effect size reductions in most remaining suicide risk correlates. Self-administered iCBT-I was associated with improvements in insomnia severity in veterans at elevated risk for suicide. These preliminary findings suggest that SI and suicide risk correlates may improve following an iCBT-I intervention, demonstrating the need for future well-powered iCBT-I RCTs targeted for populations at elevated suicide risk. Plain Language Summary: In this secondary data analysis, we examined improvements in insomnia severity, suicidal ideation (SI), and suicide risk correlates in veterans with clinically significant insomnia and elevated SI drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining an unguided internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I). Veterans in the iCBT-I group experienced greater improvements in insomnia severity and hopelessness than veterans in the Insomnia Education Website control. Although between-group differences in SI and other suicide risk correlates were not statistically significant, effect sizes suggest that SI and symptoms of depression, irritability, concentration, post-traumatic stress disorder, and hostility may improve following iCBT-I intervention. These results suggest that digital and iCBT-I interventions may be especially powerful tools for use in suicide prevention among veterans but highlight the critical need for additional large-scale studies to examine suicide-specific mechanisms and outcomes to guide implementation efforts."
10.1016/j.invent.2021.100402,Dismantling internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus. The contribution of applied relaxation: A randomized controlled trial,"Beukes EW, Andersson G, Fagelson MA, Manchaiah V.",Internet Interv,2021,2021.5.27,,,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus is an evidence-based intervention. The components of ICBT for tinnitus have, however, not been dismantled and thus the effectiveness of the different therapeutic components is unknown. It is, furthermore, not known if heterogeneous tinnitus subgroups respond differently to ICBT. AIMS: This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied relaxation within ICBT for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression. METHODS: A parallel randomized controlled trial design (n = 126) was used to compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken. RESULTS: Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation resulted in large reduction of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes d = 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences (between-group d = 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group. CONCLUSION: Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic results were compromised. Further studies employing strategies to improve compliance and engagement are required. The intervention's effectiveness increased with initial level of tinnitus distress; those with the highest scores at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger samples are needed to confirm this."
10.1111/ajr.70008,Examining the Effectiveness and Acceptability of Internet-Delivered Psychological Pain Management for Regional and Rural Australians With Chronic Pain,"Dear BF, Staples L, Nielssen O, Titov N.",Aust J Rural Health,2025,2025.2.17,,,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics, satisfaction levels and clinical outcomes of rural and remote Australians with chronic pain completing an internet-delivered psychological pain management program (PMP). DESIGN: Longitudinal routine care cohort study. SETTING: An Australian national digital psychology service. PARTICIPANTS: Patients in inner regional locations (n = 401), outer regional and remote locations (n = 198), and major cities (n = 968), who used the service over a 6-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic and clinical data, patient-reported satisfaction and improvements, and meaningful clinical improvements (≥ 30% improvement). RESULTS: Clinical improvements were observed from pre-treatment to post-treatment in pain-related disability (32% [95% CI: 29, 34]), depression symptoms (44% [95% CI: 39, 49]), anxiety symptoms (43% [95% CI: 39, 47]), and average pain intensity (23% [95% CI: 21, 26]), which were maintained to 3-month follow-up. High levels of satisfaction and treatment completion were also observed. Minor demographic and clinical differences were observed. However, there were similar rates of clinical improvement, treatment satisfaction and treatment completion in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings further highlight the value of internet-delivered psychological PMPs for Australians with chronic pain living in regional and remote parts of the country. Further work is needed to raise awareness about the availability of these effective programmes and to integrate their use with traditional pain management services."
10.1016/j.sleep.2024.10.010,Digital cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in patients with multiple sclerosis: A multiple baseline single-case pilot study,"Alfonsson S, Olofsson Liljeholm A, Adel C, Lundberg M, Cheevers C, Jansson-Fröjmark M, Buhrman M.",Sleep Med,2024,2024.10.17,,,"Insomnia has an estimated prevalence of over 20 % in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and preliminary evidence suggests that treating insomnia through cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can alleviate fatigue and other secondary symptoms in this population. Video-based CBT-I, an emerging remote treatment modality, has shown promise in previous studies for addressing insomnia in various populations, indicating its potential as an efficient treatment approach for individuals with MS. This pilot study aimed to assess the impact of video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I) on individuals with comorbid insomnia and multiple sclerosis (MS). Out of the ten participants, six experienced statistically significant reductions in total wake time during the night, while seven demonstrated clinically significant improvements in waking time, and eight achieved insomnia remission based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). These findings align with prior research indicating the effectiveness of CBT-I in addressing sleep disturbances and its promising potential for insomnia in MS. Moreover, improvements in depression symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9, and reductions in worry, as assessed by the GAD-7, were observed. Although fatigue outcomes varied, suggesting a potential need for optimal sleep duration, participants reported enhanced quality of life and high treatment satisfaction. These results suggest that VCBT-I is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for individuals with comorbid MS and insomnia, highlighting its potential to alleviate both sleep-related and psychological symptoms."
10.3389/fpsyt.2022.828481,Do Improvements in Therapeutic Game-Based Skills Transfer to Real Life Improvements in Children's Emotion-Regulation Abilities and Mental Health? A Pilot Study That Offers Preliminary Validity of the REThink In-game Performance Scoring,"David OA, Magurean S, Tomoiagă C.",Front Psychiatry,2022,2022.4.7,,,"Therapeutic or serious games are considered innovative ways of delivering psychological interventions especially suited for children and adolescents, which can have a positive impact on mental health, while also being fun and easily accessible online. While most serious games for children and adolescents address specific issues, such as anxiety or depression, preventive measures received less attention. REThink is an online therapeutic game designed as a stand-alone prevention tool, aiming to increase resilience in healthy children and adolescents in a Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy framework (David et al., 2019). The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the validity of in-game performance measurements or scores as indicators of the game effectiveness in building real life emotion-regulation abilities. We analyzed how scores of different game levels (addressing different skills) are associated with improvements in mental health and emotion regulation abilities. Our preliminary results suggest that in-game performance at some levels (scores) consistently reflect improvements in psychological functioning, while in-game performance at other levels are less associated with changes in real life self-reported psychological functioning. These results offer important information about which levels can be used as preliminary indicators of psychological improvements, and which levels need to be revised in terms of task or scoring. Overall, results of our study offer preliminary validation of REThink's game scoring system, while also suggesting the elements to be refined."

Research suggests that chronic insomnia prompts changes in central stress processing that have downstream negative effects on health and mood, as well as on cognitive, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative functioning. We hypothesize that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) will reverse those downstream effects by improving insomnia and restoring healthy central stress processing. Rural caregivers are particularly vulnerable, but they have limited access to CBT-I; therefore, we developed an accessible digital version using community input (NiteCAPP CARES). OBJECTIVE: This trial will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and short-term and long-term effects of NiteCAPP CARES on the sleep and stress mechanisms underlying poor caregiver health and functioning. METHODS: Dyads (n=100) consisting of caregivers with chronic insomnia and their coresiding persons with dementia will be recruited from Columbia and surrounding areas in Missouri, United States. Participant dyads will be randomized to 4 weeks (plus 4 bimonthly booster sessions) of NiteCAPP CARES or a web-based sleep hygiene control (NiteCAPP SHARES). Participants will be assessed at baseline, after treatment, and 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The following assessments will be completed by caregivers: 1 week of actigraphy and daily diaries measuring sleep, Insomnia Severity Index, arousal (heart rate variability), inflammation (blood-derived biomarkers: interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein), neurodegeneration (blood-derived biomarkers: plasma amyloid beta [Aβ40 and Aβ42], total tau, and phosphorylated tau [p-tau181 and p-tau217]), cognition (Joggle battery, NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function, and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), stress and burden, health, and mood (depression and anxiety). Persons with dementia will complete 1 week of actigraphy at each time point. RESULTS: Recruitment procedures started in February 2022. All data are expected to be collected by 2026. Full trial results are planned to be published by 2027. Secondary analyses of baseline data will be subsequently published. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial tests NiteCAPP CARES, a web-based CBT-I for rural caregivers. The knowledge obtained will address not only what outcomes improve but also how and why they improve and for how long, which will help us to modify NiteCAPP CARES to optimize treatment potency and support future pragmatic testing and dissemination.

Conversational agents, which are dialog systems capable of understanding and generating human language, have emerged as a potential tool to enhance symptom management through interactive support. OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics and effectiveness of conversational agent-delivered interventions reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the management of both physical and psychological symptoms. DESIGN: A systematic review. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in Pubmed, ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, PyscInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and gray literature sources from their inception to Oct 2024. Search terms included ""conversational agent"", ""symptom"", ""randomized controlled trial"" and their synonyms and hyponyms. Duplicates were identified by EndNote, and titles, abstracts and full texts were independently screened according to predefined criteria. Data extraction focused on basic study characteristics and conversational agent details, with The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool employed for bias assessment. RESULTS: The search yielded 2756 articles and 29 were finally included for review. The included studies predominantly came from developed countries (n = 23) and were conducted between 2020 and 2024 (n = 24). The studies frequently evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of conversational agent interventions (n = 14), with a predominantly focus on psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, etc.) (n = 17). A few studies focused on physical symptoms (pain, etc.) (n = 4), while others addressed both symptoms (n = 8). Twenty-five distinct conversational agents (Woebot, Tess, etc.) were evaluated, utilizing platforms ranging from proprietary applications to common messaging channels like WeChat and Facebook Messenger. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was a commonly integrated approach (n = 22), with rule-based dialogs (n = 22) as the most commonly dialog system methods and Natural Language Processing (NLP) (n = 15) as the predominant AI techniques. The median recruitment and completion rates were 72 % and 79 %, respectively. The majority of studies reported positive user experiences and significant symptom management improvements (n = 22). However, risk of bias was high in seventeen studies and presented some concerns in nine others. CONCLUSIONS: Conversational agents have shown promise in enhancing both physical and psychological symptom management through positive user experiences and effectiveness. However, the high risk of bias identified in many studies warrants caution in interpreting these findings. Future research should prioritize the methodological quality of RCTs to strengthen the evidence base supporting the use of conversational agents as a complementary tool in symptom management."

Therefore, early intervention for acute insomnia is vital to prevent chronicity. Previous trials with small sample sizes have shown that brief versions of both individual and group-based face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can improve insomnia symptoms among those with acute insomnia. However, it is unknown whether one-week internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in treating acute insomnia. This was a randomized controlled trial and 192 participants were randomly assigned to the CBT-I group (n = 95) or control group (n = 97). The primary outcome was the incidence of chronic insomnia, determined via a structured diagnostic questionnaire for insomnia disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Secondary outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Sleep Hygiene and Practices Scale (SHPS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2). At week 12, the incidence of chronic insomnia was significantly lower in the CBT-I group compared with control group (33.3% [27/81] vs. 65.8% [52/79]). Participants in the CBT-I group achieved significantly more improvements in ISI, ESS, PSAS, FIRST, SHPS, HADS-Depression, and the mental component summary and physical component summary of SF-12v2 than control group, but not DBAS and HADS-Anxiety. This one-week internet-delivered CBT-I program is an effective tool to prevent the chronicity of acute insomnia."

This randomized controlled trial will compare a traditional symptom severity decision-making algorithm to a novel multivariate decision-making algorithm for triage to and adaptation of mental health care. The stratified levels of care include a self-guided online wellness program, coach-guided online cognitive behavioral therapy, and clinician-delivered psychotherapy with or without pharmacotherapy. The novel multivariate algorithm will be comprised of baseline (for triage and adaptation) and time-varying variables (for adaptation) in four areas: social determinants of mental health, early adversity and life stressors, predisposing, enabling, and need influences on health service use, and comprehensive mental health status. The overarching goal is to evaluate whether the multivariate algorithm improves adherence to treatment, symptoms, and functioning above and beyond the symptom-based algorithm. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial will recruit a total of 1000 participants over the course of 5 years in the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Participants will be recruited from a highly diverse sample of community college students. For the symptom severity approach, initial triaging to level of care will be based on symptom severity, whereas for the multivariate approach, the triaging will be based on a comprehensive set of baseline measures. After the initial triaging, level of care will be adapted throughout the duration of the treatment, utilizing either symptom severity or multivariate statistical approaches. Participants will complete computerized assessments and self-report questionnaires at baseline and up to 40 weeks. The multivariate decision-making algorithm will be updated annually to improve predictive outcomes. DISCUSSION: Results will provide a comparison on the traditional symptom severity decision-making and the novel multivariate decision-making with respect to treatment adherence, symptom improvement, and functional recovery. Moreover, the developed multivariate decision-making algorithms may be used as a template in other community college settings. Ultimately, findings will inform the practice of level of care triage and adaptation in psychological treatments, as well as the use of personalized mental health care broadly.

It is closely linked to decreased health-related quality of life and symptoms such as depression and sleep disturbances. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment that targets severe fatigue in patients with brain tumours. Cognitive behavioural therapy is aimed at fatigue-maintaining beliefs and behaviour. This therapy has been proven effective in reducing severe fatigue in cancer survivors and patients with multiple sclerosis. A blended therapy program combines sessions with a therapist with therapist-guided web-based therapy modules. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of blended cognitive behavioural therapy in treating severe fatigue in patients with diffuse glioma. METHODS: We will include a maximum of 100 patients with diffuse glioma with clinically and radiologically stable disease and severe fatigue (i.e. Checklist Individual Strength, subscale fatigue severity ≥ 35). Patients will be randomized to blended cognitive behavioural therapy or a waiting list condition. The 12-week intervention GRIP on fatigue consists of five patient-therapist sessions and five to eight individualized web-based therapy modules supported by email contact. The primary outcome measure is fatigue severity. Secondary outcome measures include sleep quality, health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, functional impairment and subjective and objective cognitive functioning. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 14 and 24 weeks. Magnetoencephalography and MRI will be used to evaluate potential biomarkers for intervention success. This trial has a Bayesian design: we will conduct multiple interim analyses to test for efficacy or futility of the trial. This is the first trial within the GRIP trial platform: a platform developing four to five different interventions for the most common symptoms in patients with diffuse glioma. DISCUSSION: The results of the GRIP on fatigue trial will provide information about the efficacy of this intervention on fatigue in patients with diffuse glioma. Multiple other outcomes and possible predictors of treatment success will also be explored. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NL8711 . Registered on 14 June 2020."
10.2196/30138,Cannabis Use in Adults Who Screen Positive for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: CANreduce 2.0 Randomized Controlled Trial Subgroup Analysis,"Ahlers J, Baumgartner C, Augsburger M, Wenger A, Malischnig D, Boumparis N, Berger T, Stark L, Ebert DD, Haug S, Schaub MP.",J Med Internet Res,2022,2022.4.20,,,"BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates for lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder are much higher in people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than in those without. CANreduce 2.0 is an intervention that is generally effective at reducing cannabis use in cannabis misusers. This self-guided web-based intervention (6-week duration) consists of modules grounded in motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether the CANreduce 2.0 intervention affects cannabis use patterns and symptom severity in adults who screen positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder more than in those who do not. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a previous study with the inclusion criterion of cannabis use at least once weekly over the last 30 days. Adults with and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (based on the Adult Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder Self-Report screener) who were enrolled to the active intervention arms of CANreduce 2.0 were compared regarding the number of days cannabis was used in the preceding 30 days, the cannabis use disorder identification test score (CUDIT) and the severity of dependence scale score (SDS) at baseline and the 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were Generalized Anxiety Disorder score, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale score, retention, intervention adherence, and safety. RESULTS: Both adults with (n=94) and without (n=273) positive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening reported significantly reduced frequency (reduction in consumption days: with: mean 11.53, SD 9.28, P<.001; without: mean 8.53, SD 9.4, P<.001) and severity of cannabis use (SDS: with: mean 3.57, SD 3.65, P<.001; without: mean 2.47, SD 3.39, P<.001; CUDIT: with: mean 6.38, SD 5.96, P<.001; without: mean 5.33, SD 6.05, P<.001), as well as anxiety (with: mean 4.31, SD 4.71, P<.001; without: mean 1.84, SD 4.22, P<.001) and depression (with: mean 10.25, SD 10.54; without: mean 4.39, SD 10.22, P<.001). Those who screened positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder also reported significantly decreased attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores (mean 4.65, SD 4.44, P<.001). There were no significant differences in change in use (P=.08), dependence (P=.95), use disorder (P=.85), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder status (P=.84), depression (P=.84), or anxiety (P=.26) between baseline and final follow-up, dependent on positive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity at baseline was not associated with reduced cannabis use frequency or severity but was linked to greater reductions in depression (Spearman ρ=.33) and anxiety (Spearman ρ=.28). Individuals with positive attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening were significantly less likely to fill out the consumption diary (P=.02), but the association between continuous attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity and retention (Spearman ρ=-0.10, P=.13) was nonsignificant. There also was no significant intergroup difference in the number of completed modules (with: mean 2.10, SD 2.33; without: mean 2.36, SD 2.36, P=.34), and there was no association with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity (Spearman ρ=-0.09; P=.43). The same was true for the rate of adverse effects (P=.33). CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis users screening positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may benefit from CANreduce 2.0 to decrease the frequency and severity of cannabis dependence and attenuate symptoms of depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-related symptoms.

10.2196/55786,Effectiveness of Unguided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Subthreshold Social Anxiety Disorder in Adolescents and Young Adults: Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,"Matsumoto K, Hamatani S, Shiga K, Iiboshi K, Kasai M, Kimura Y, Yokota S, Watanabe K, Kubo Y, Nakamura M.",JMIR Pediatr Parent,2024,2024.7.22,,,"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common mental disorder in adolescents and young adults. Early intervention and support could help prevent the development of full-blown SAD. Considering that adolescents with social anxiety symptoms do not prefer face-to-face sessions due to their fear of communicating with therapists, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) was implemented. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of complete self-help ICBT for subthreshold SAD in high school and college students with no history of mental disorders. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to demonstrate the objective was conducted from December 2022 to October 2023. Participants were students enrolled at 6 universities and 1 high school. The intervention was a complete self-help ICBT and consisted of 10 text-based sessions that taught cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for social anxiety in youths and young adults. The comparison was a no-treatment condition (control group), which was randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by a computer program. A total of 2 psychological scales were used to assess the severity of social anxiety, and 1 psychological scale each was used to measure symptoms of depression, general anxiety, and quality of life. RESULTS: In total, 77 students were enrolled as study participants. Through the randomization procedure, 38 participants were included in the intervention group, and 39 patients were included in the control group. Results from the analysis of covariance with depression as covariates showed that the participants in the intervention group had significantly reduced symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and general anxiety compared to the control group. The response rate was 61% (19/31) in the intervention group and 24% (9/38) in the control group: odds ratio (OR) 4.97 (95% CI 1.61-16.53; P=.003) in the Fisher exact test. The recovery rate was 68% (21/31) in the intervention group and 34% (13/38) in the control group: OR 3.95 (95% CI 1.32-12.56; P=.008). The OR for the remission ratio was 2.01 (95% CI 0.64-6.60; P=.20) and for the risk of worsening was 0.23 (95% CI 0.002-1.33; P=.10), but no significant difference was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this randomized controlled trial show that fully unguided ICBT improves subthreshold SAD in adolescents and young adults. Interpretation of the effectiveness in preventing SAD that meets the diagnostic criteria is limited by sample size and the follow-up period. Future studies should include more extended observations and larger sample sizes in high-risk populations.

Weight gain during adolescence is related to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers in later life. Presently, adolescents living in Australia have limited access to age-appropriate obesity prevention services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether a two-way text message program, with optional telephone health counseling, improves body mass index (BMI) z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents who are overweight. METHODS: This study will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial (N=150) comparing a two-way text message intervention, with optional telephone health counseling, to usual care in adolescents (13-18 years old, inclusive) who are overweight (recruited from a pediatric weight management clinic and the broader community in Sydney, Australia). The intervention group will receive a six-month text message program, which consists of two-way, semipersonalized, lifestyle-focused text messages (four messages/week) in addition to usual care. The control group will be assigned to receive usual care. The study also includes a follow-up at 12-months. The primary outcome is a change in BMI z score at six months. Secondary outcomes are changes in waist-to-height ratio, diet, physical and sedentary activity levels, sleep quality, quality of life, self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support, and eating disorder and depression symptoms. Also, we will examine acceptability, utility, and engagement with the program through a study-specific process evaluation questionnaire, semi-structured telephone interviews, and an analysis of health counselor communication logs. The analyses will be performed by the intention-to-treat principle to assess differences between intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The study opened for recruitment in December 2019. Data collection is expected to be completed by December 2021, and the results for the primary outcome are expected to be published in early 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will test the effectiveness of an interactive two-way text message program compared to usual care in improving BMI z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents with overweight. This interactive, innovative, and scalable project also aims to inform future practice and community initiatives to promote obesity prevention behaviors for adolescents.

10.1093/ajhp/zxae255,Insomnia in ambulatory care: A clinical review,"Dopheide JA, Roth WR, Chu MKL.",Am J Health Syst Pharm,2025,2024.9.26,,,"PURPOSE: One-third to one-half of ambulatory care patients report insomnia. The objective of this clinical review is to detail the many causes and evidence-based treatment options for insomnia in outpatients and to recommend screening and summarize evidence for the place in therapy of prescription and nonprescription treatments. SUMMARY: This work provides an overview of the literature on insomnia regarding causes, patient assessment, and nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Patients who present with insomnia should be assessed for sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, and all contributing medications as well as medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorder diagnoses. The type of insomnia, namely difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening with resulting functional impairment, should be documented in addition to whether insomnia is short term or persistent. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) or digital CBT-I is first-line treatment for all patients with insomnia irrespective of the cause or type. Nonprescription treatments such as antihistamines or melatonin are for select populations. Prescription hypnotics are best utilized on an as-needed basis or for nightly use for less than 6 weeks. Z-hypnotics are safe and effective for insomnia in persons with depression or an anxiety disorder but should be avoided in older individuals or if there is respiratory or cognitive impairment. Orexin receptor antagonists are effective for sleep initiation and maintenance in healthy persons or if there is mild cognitive impairment, but they require further study in individuals with psychiatric and medical diagnoses. Trazodone is the most prescribed off-label treatment due to its efficacy for sleep initiation and maintenance and its lack of abuse potential. CONCLUSION: Insomnia treatment should be guided by patient age, diagnoses, and type of insomnia. Pharmacological treatments should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time."

METHODS: Stakeholder groups included service providers (n = 6), commercial iCBT representatives (n = 6) and patients who received a course of iCBT as part of treatment at the service (n = 7). Participants took part in a semi-structured interview over the telephone, and subsequent data were qualitatively analyzed using the descriptive-interpretive approach. RESULTS: Service providers highlighted the importance of effective leadership and management, training initiatives, the provision of feedback to commercial iCBT representatives and creating work structures around iCBT to facilitate iCBT supporting staff in their use of it. Commercial iCBT representatives similarly reported the importance of training clinicians in iCBT use, identifying the appropriate individuals at all levels of the service to drive iCBT implementation, and the importance of being responsive to any problems or needs that arise from the service. Patients reported an overall positive experience of receiving iCBT but highlighted a need for more information from their supporter and the intervention to better structure their usage. Contextual factors, in terms of barriers and facilitators, were also highlighted by service provider and commercial participants; citing negative clinician attitudes and technological issues/bugs as barriers to implementation, and the exposure to iCBT created by COVID-19 and perseverance in using iCBT over time as facilitators. DISCUSSION: The findings contribute to a growing field of literature that seeks to understand the experience of relevant stakeholders who are involved with and contribute to iCBT implementation, including commercial iCBT representatives who, to our knowledge, have not been accounted for as part of published research to date."

We therefore developed an internet-administered, guided, low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy-based self-help intervention (EJDeR). We examined the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and study procedures in the single-arm feasibility trial ENGAGE. Results suggested the intervention and study procedures are feasible and acceptable. However, a need for modifications and refinements to the intervention and study procedures was identified. We conducted a qualitative interview study to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and study procedures from the perspective of parents to inform modifications and refinements to the intervention and study procedures. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 parents (17 fathers, 35 mothers). A public contribution group (three parents of children treated for cancer) analysed the data independently from the research team and contributed to dissemination. An inductive content analysis was performed using the Framework Method. RESULTS: The intervention was perceived as acceptable and relevant, and parents expressed positive attitudes toward internet-administered support. However, parents identified a need for adaptations to intervention content, e.g., a greater focus on the family, trauma, and the cancer experience. Barriers to engagement were also identified, including technical difficulties and a need for modifications to improve intervention user-friendliness and smartphone and/or tablet compatibility. Study procedures were also perceived as acceptable and feasible. However, a need was identified to improve parents' understanding of the study and to reduce the amount and frequency of assessments. The public contributors' analysis was similar to that of the research team. However, the research team overlooked important nuances. For example, the public contributors' analysis highlighted parents' difficulties distinguishing between the intervention and study procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention and study procedures were perceived as acceptable and feasible. However, the need for important modifications and refinements were suggested to improve future acceptability and feasibility. Involving public contributors in the analysis resulted in developing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the data.

Refugees are at considerable risk of developing common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most refugees do not have access to mental health services for these problems because of multiple barriers in national and refugee specific health systems, including limited availability of mental health professionals. To counter some of challenges arising from limited mental health system capacity the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a range of scalable psychological interventions aimed at reducing psychological distress and improving functioning in people living in communities affected by adversity. These interventions, including Problem Management Plus (PM+) and its variants, are intended to be delivered through individual or group face-to-face or smartphone formats by lay, non-professional people who have not received specialized mental health training, We provide an evidence-based rationale for the use of the scalable PM+ oriented programmes being adapted for Syrian refugees and provide information on the newly launched STRENGTHS programme for adapting, testing and scaling up of PM+ in various modalities in both neighbouring and European countries hosting Syrian refugees.

10.1002/14651858.CD012489.pub2,E-Health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions,"Thabrew H, Stasiak K, Hetrick SE, Wong S, Huss JH, Merry SN.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2018,2018.8.16,,,"Update of doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012489. BACKGROUND: Long-term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to face-to-face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e-health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text-based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of e-health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting-list controls, or non-psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 - 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross-search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand-searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, and cross-over trials of e-health interventions for treating any type of long-term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long-term physical conditions as those that were more than three-months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient- or clinician-administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 (American Psychological Association 2013), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria (World Health Organization 1992). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non-psychological therapies were eligible comparators. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta-analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web-MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta-analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries.For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low-quality evidence that e-health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants).For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long-term physical condition, there was very low-quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e-health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants).The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present, the field of e-health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low-quality of the evidence means the effects of e-health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years.Although it is too early to recommend e-health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically-based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long-term physical conditions."
10.2196/72321,Optimization of Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Canadian Leaders Within Public Safety: Qualitative Study,"Price JA, McCall HC, Demyen SA, Spencer SM, Katz BM, Clairmont AP, Hadjistavropoulos HD.",J Med Internet Res,2025,2025.4.17,,,"BACKGROUND: Canadian public safety personnel (PSP) report high rates of mental health concerns and barriers to treatment. PSPNET is a clinical research unit that offers internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) that is free, confidential, and developed with and for PSP. Treatment outcomes are promising with clinically significant symptom improvement (eg, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress) and favorable treatment satisfaction. While these results are promising, research has yet to explore ways to optimize therapist-guided ICBT for leaders within public safety. Optimizing ICBT for leaders is particularly important given their widespread organizational impact. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate (1) the perceived mental health stressors of Canadian leaders within public safety, (2) the degree to which leaders perceived existing therapist-guided ICBT courses tailored for PSP (ie, PSP Wellbeing Course and PSP PTSD Course) as suitable for their needs, and (3) ways to further optimize therapist-guided ICBT for public safety leaders. METHODS: This study included 10 clients who self-identified as being in a supervisory or leadership position within their public safety organization and completed either the therapist-guided PSP Wellbeing Course or PSP PTSD Course. We used descriptive statistics to analyze demographics, mental health symptoms, treatment engagement, and treatment satisfaction. We also used a reflexive thematic analysis of semistructured interview transcripts to assess leaders' course perceptions and feedback. RESULTS: Canadian leaders within public safety reported occupational and nonoccupational stressors and enrolled in ICBT to support their own or colleagues' mental health. Most clients enrolled in the PSP Wellbeing Course, accessed 4 of 5 lessons (n=7, 70%), engaged with therapist support (n=7, 70%), and identified as employed (n=8, 80%), White (n=8, 80%), and men (n=7, 70%) with an average age of 45 years. At pretreatment, 80% of clients endorsed clinically significant symptoms of one or more disorders; most often depression (n=7, 70%) and anger (n=6, 60%). Clients reported favorable attitudes toward the ICBT courses with most reporting that they were satisfied with the course (n=9, 90%). Feedback to further optimize ICBT content for leaders included the development of a leader case story (n=6, 60%) and new resources to help leaders apply skills learned in ICBT within the context of their leadership roles (n=4, 40%). Leaders also recommended optimizing ICBT delivery by improving the platform technology and incorporating more multimedia. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian leaders within public safety perceived therapist-guided ICBT developed with and for PSP as a suitable treatment option for their needs and identified ways to further optimize its content and delivery. Future research should investigate the impacts of these efforts and explore optimizing ICBT for other groups of clients.

Viable therapy options for the treatment of SAD include CBT being delivered virtually. In Australia, an innovative internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for social anxiety has been developed, implemented, and demonstrated as effective. To make available high-quality and real-time evidence in response to the crucial need to access psychological services to meet population mental health needs, we propose to conduct a Canadian adaptation of the iCBT Shyness Program and to examine the program's effectiveness, and implementation in two Canadian provinces (Quebec and Ontario). METHODS: The overall study design is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of a quasi-experimental parallel group trial. Prior to implementing the iCBT Shyness Program, it will undergo an initial adaptation to the Canadian context and focus groups will be conducted with key actor groups to discuss the adaptations to the graphics, narration of the lessons, and this to better reflect varying socio-cultural context among Canadian French- and English-speaking populations. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the program in three parallel pathways reflecting real-world pathways: (1) self-refer to the intervention; (2) recommended by a health professional without guidance; and (3) recommended by a health professional, with low-intensity guidance. Data collection will be carried out at baseline, at the beginning of each lesson, 12-week and 6-month follow-up. Outcomes measured will include anxiety and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, disability, as well as health service utilization and satisfaction. Semi-structured interviews will then be conducted with study participants and health care providers to explore facilitating factors and barriers to the implementation of the iCBT adapted program. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness, barriers and facilitating factors to implementing a low-intensity iCBT in the Canadian context for SAD, which will bridge an important care gap for undeserved populations in Canada with SAD. Findings will inform the eventual scaling up of the program in community-based primary care across Canada. This would improve equity of the health care system by helping a large number of Canadians to timely access to mental health services. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT06403995.

Providing effective and evidence-based interventions, such as SMS text messaging programs, can improve PSP's overall mental well-being with high user satisfaction rates. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate users' satisfaction, receptiveness, and perceptions of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based supportive SMS text messaging intervention (Text4PTSI). METHODS: Participants self-subscribed to Text4PTSI and received unidirectional cognitive behavioral-based supportive text messages for 6 months. Participants completed a web-based survey delivered via SMS text message at enrollment, and 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post enrollment. Respondents' perception and receptivity of the program were assessed using a questionnaire measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Data were collected as categorical variables, and overall satisfaction with the Text4PTSI program was measured on a scale from 0 to 100. RESULTS: There were 131 subscribers to the Text4PTSI program; however, only 81 subscribers responded to the survey, producing 100 survey responses across the 3 follow-up time points. The overall mean score of satisfaction was 85.12 (SD 13.35). More than half of the survey responses agreed or strongly agreed that Text4PTSI helped participants cope with anxiety (79/100 responses, 79%), depressive symptoms (72/100 responses, 72%), and loneliness (54/100 responses, 54%). Similarly, most of the survey responses agreed or strongly agreed that the Text4PTSI program made respondents feel connected to a support system, improved their overall mental well-being (84/100 responses, 84%), felt more hopeful about managing concerns about their mental health or substance use (82 out of responses, 82%), and helped enhance their overall quality of life (77/100 responses, 77%). The available survey responses suggest that the majority always read the supportive text messages (84/100 responses, 84%), took time to reflect on each message (75/100 responses, 75%), and returned to read the text messages more than once (76/100 responses, 76%). CONCLUSIONS: PSP who responded to the follow-up surveys reported high user satisfaction and appreciation for receiving the Text4PTSI intervention during the 6-month program. The reported satisfaction with the service provided could pave the way to ensuring a better uptake of the service with potential effectiveness to end users."

The results revealed that NPIs significantly reduced IA levels (standardized mean difference, SMD: -2.01, 95% confidence interval, CI: -2.29 to -1.73, I2 = 93.0%), anxiety levels (SMD: -1.07, 95%CI: -1.41 to -0.73, I2 = 72.4%), depression levels (SMD: -1.11, 95%CI: -1.52 to -0.7, I2 = 84.3%), and SCL-90 (SMD: -0.75, 95%CI: -0.97 to -0.54, I2 = 27.7%). Subgroup analysis stratified by intervention measure showed that cognitive behavioral therapy, group counseling, sports intervention, combined intervention, educational intervention, positive psychology intervention, sandplay intervention, and mobile health were all effective in relieving symptoms of IA except electrotherapy. CONCLUSION: NPIs appear to be effective in the treatment of IA in youth, which would act as an alternative treatment of IA. Further studies with larger sample sizes and robust designs are needed."
10.1177/1357633X211047285,Are online mental health interventions for youth effective? A systematic review,"Zhou X, Edirippulige S, Bai X, Bambling M.",J Telemed Telecare,2021,2021.11.2,,,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of online mental health interventions for youth. METHODS: We searched seven electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS) for the past 10 years to identify randomized controlled trials which have evaluated the use of telehealth interventions for young people with mental health problems. The included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias. RESULTS: Forty-five randomized controlled trials (n = 13,291 participants) were eligible for this review. Most studies (35 trials) evaluated the use of web-based self-help platforms to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (14 trials), mindfulness (four trials), acceptance commitment therapy (five trials) and positive psychology (two trials). Mobile/computer applications were used to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (four trials) and coping strategies training (two trials). Web-based synchronous chat (one trial) was used to assist communication between counsellors and participants. Three studies used artificial intelligence-based conversational agents to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (two trials) and problem-solving-strategy training (one trial). Eighty-two percent (n = 37) identified the participants as student population (i.e. university students, high school students). Sixty-four percent (n = 29) of the telehealth interventions were found to be effective in managing depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia and improving quality of life when compared with control conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Online mental health interventions were found to be effective in managing diverse mental health conditions among youth. Online self-help platforms were the most frequently used modality and artificial intelligence-based chatbots are merging as potential solutions. Future research is warranted to investigate the solutions to improve the retention rate and satisfaction of telehealth interventions among this population."
10.1016/j.invent.2024.100778,"The Sleep Course: An inclusive trial examining the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a digital sleep intervention for adults with self-reported sleep difficulties","Scott AJ, Hathway T, Bisby MA, Titov N, Dear BF.",Internet Interv,2024,2024.10.21,,,"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is a well-established first-line treatment for insomnia and sleep difficulties, yet numerous barriers hinder its widespread adoption. One potential criticism of the existing evidence base for CBTi is that many trials exclude participants that would commonly be seen in in primary care, such as those aged over 65, with comorbid health conditions, or prescribed sleep medication. The current pilot study therefore aimed to assess the acceptability and efficacy of a brief, digitally delivered sleep intervention, the Sleep Course, using a broad range of participants. Participants (n = 74) completed the 6-week, 4-lesson intervention alongside measures of sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, depression, anxiety and sleep-wake patterns (via sleep diary). Generalized estimating equations analysis modelled change in participants' outcomes from pre- to post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, and subgroup analyses explored the role of possible moderators (e.g., age over 65, co-morbidities, and concurrent prescription medication use). The intervention was associated with good rates of satisfaction (79 %) and lesson completion (70 %). Results showed significant and large reductions in insomnia, sleep disturbance and associated symptoms (e.g., d = 1.06-1.37 change in insomnia symptoms). Evidence of high acceptability and clinical improvement was found irrespective of age, physical comorbidity, and sleep medication use. However, there was evidence of less improvement among those taking medications or having tried psychological treatment in the past. These results provide strong preliminary evidence for the intervention as an acceptable, efficacious and scalable treatment for a broad range of participants with sleep difficulties. Larger randomised controlled trials are needed."

This study investigates whether changes in Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) during dCBT-I mediate changes in psychological distress, fatigue, and insomnia severity. PATIENTS/METHODS: The study presents a secondary planned analysis of data from 1073 participants in a randomized control trial (Total sample = 1721) of dCBT-I compared with patient education (PE). Self-ratings with the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were obtained at baseline and 9-week follow-up. Hayes PROCESS mediation analyses were conducted to test for mediation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: sDBAS scores were significantly reduced at 9-week follow-up for those randomized to dCBT-I (n = 566) compared with PE (n = 507). The estimated mean difference was -1.49 (95% CI -1.66 to -1.31, p < .001, Cohen's d. = 0.93). DBAS mediated all the effect of dCBT-I on the HADS and the CFQ, and 64% of the change on the ISI (Estimated indirect effect -3.14, 95% CI -3.60 to -2.68) at 9-week follow-up compared with PE. Changes in the DBAS fully mediated the effects of dCBT-I on psychological distress and fatigue, and the DBAS partially mediated the effects on insomnia severity. These findings may have implications for understanding how dCBT-I works and highlights the role of changing cognitions in dCBT-I."
10.1002/pchj.333,The prediction of behavioral intention to use online mental health interventions,"Chuenphitthayavut K, Zihuang T, Zhu T.",Psych J,2020,2020.1.21,,,"This cross-sectional study addresses two important contributions to understanding behavioral intention to use online mental health interventions: (a) to investigate the proposed behavioral intention model in predicting the use of online mental health interventions, and (b) to compare the proposed behavioral intention model in predicting the use of online mental health interventions between Chinese and Thai patients and between healthy individuals and those with mental health disorders. The samples included 250 Chinese respondents and 251 Thai respondents. Data were collected using Likert questionnaires with a reliability of 0.75 to 0.95 and analyzed via confirmatory factor analysis and multigroup structural equation modeling. The structural model of behavioral intention to use online mental health intervention was shown the significant acceptances on indices in overall group. However, the result did not enhance the previous literature review according to the proposed behavioral intention model. Most latent variables in this study did not show an influence on behavioral intention to use online mental health services. Individual characteristics, particularly mental health literacy, only significantly predicted behavioral intention to use online mental health interventions. However, significant influences in some observed variables were detected, such as informational support and emotional support in social support, including media and the general public in social influence. Comparing the multigroup model, no difference in the causal relationship model between Chinese and Thai patients was found, but a difference between healthy individuals and those with mental health disorders, especially individual characteristics to behavioral intention path and social support to attitude toward use path, was found. Results highlight the benefits of further development and patient education of online mental health services in the future."
10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjae183,"Modifiable Psychological Factors are Associated With Clusters of Pain, Fatigue, Fecal Incontinence, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Type Symptoms in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Latent Profile Analysis","Wileman V, Chilcot J, Norton C, Hart A, Miller L, Stagg I, Seaton N, Pollok R, Aziz Q, Moss-Morris R.",J Crohns Colitis,2025,2024.12.10,,,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes fatigue, pain, and fecal urgency/incontinence symptoms. Identifying symptom profile subgroups and related psychological correlates might enable earlier intervention and more effective tailored treatment pathways. METHODS: This study was nested within a randomized controlled trial of a digital symptom intervention for people with IBD (n = 780). Latent profile analysis was conducted on pre-randomization baseline measures of fatigue, pain, and fecal incontinence. Multinominal logistic regression examined associations between profile membership and clinical, demographic and psychological factors. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis determined a three-profile model: Moderate (50%), High (40%), and Severe symptoms (10%). Diagnosis and fecal calprotectin were not associated with profile membership, but female gender, comorbidity, time since diagnosis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms were associated with High and Severe symptoms profiles. Depression, anxiety, negative symptom perceptions, all-or-nothing and avoidance behaviors significantly increased the relative risk of High and Severe symptoms profile membership. CONCLUSIONS: Many participants experienced symptoms even when deemed to be in clinical remission. After controlling for clinical, inflammatory, and demographic factors, the relative risk of High or Severe symptom profile membership was associated with potentially modifiable cognitive behavioral factors. These factors were also associated with IBS-type symptoms. Recognizing the potential impact of cognitive behavioral factors in exacerbating symptoms can lead to earlier identification of patients who require support and allows treatment plans to be tailored more precisely. The findings from this study promote a more integrated approach to IBD management, combining medical treatment with cognitive behavioral interventions to enhance patient care and improve outcomes."
10.1017/S0033291725001126,Brief psychological interventions for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Pike B, Ambrosio L, Ellett L.",Psychol Med,2025,2025.5.13,,,"BACKGROUND: Although cognitive behavioral therapy for people diagnosed with schizophrenia (CBTp) is recommended in clinical guidelines internationally, rates of implementation are low. One consequence of this has been the development of brief individual psychological interventions, which are shorter than the recommended minimum of 16 sessions for CBTp. This article is the first to systematically identify the brief interventions that exist for people diagnosed with schizophrenia and to determine their effectiveness using meta-analysis. METHODS: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science) were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials or experimental studies of brief individual psychological interventions delivered in community settings. Random effects meta-analysis was used to integrate effect sizes, due to the heterogeneity of included studies. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified (n = 1,382) that measured thirty clinical outcomes and included six intervention types - brief CBT, memory training, digital motivation support, reasoning training, psychoeducation, and virtual reality. Collectively, brief psychological interventions were found to be effective for psychotic symptoms (SMD -0.285, p < 0.01), paranoia (SMD -0.277, p < 0.05), data gathering (SMD 0.38, p < 0.01), depression (SMD -0.906, p < 0.05) and wellbeing (SMD 0.405, p < 0.01). For intervention types, brief CBT was effective for psychotic symptoms (SMD -0.32, p < .001), and reasoning training was effective for data gathering (SMD 0.38, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests that brief psychological interventions are effective for several key difficulties associated with schizophrenia, providing an opportunity to improve both access to, and choice of, treatment for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia."
10.2196/jmir.9262,eHealth as the Next-Generation Perinatal Care: An Overview of the Literature,"van den Heuvel JF, Groenhof TK, Veerbeek JH, van Solinge WW, Lely AT, Franx A, Bekker MN.",J Med Internet Res,2018,2018.6.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Unrestricted by time and place, electronic health (eHealth) provides solutions for patient empowerment and value-based health care. Women in the reproductive age are particularly frequent users of internet, social media, and smartphone apps. Therefore, the pregnant patient seems to be a prime candidate for eHealth-supported health care with telemedicine for fetal and maternal conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the current literature on eHealth developments in pregnancy to assess this new generation of perinatal care. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of studies on eHealth technology in perinatal care in PubMed and EMBASE in June 2017. Studies reporting the use of eHealth during prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal care were included. Given the heterogeneity in study methods, used technologies, and outcome measurements, results were analyzed and presented in a narrative overview of the literature. RESULTS: The literature search provided 71 studies of interest. These studies were categorized in 6 domains: information and eHealth use, lifestyle (gestational weight gain, exercise, and smoking cessation), gestational diabetes, mental health, low- and middle-income countries, and telemonitoring and teleconsulting. Most studies in gestational diabetes and mental health show that eHealth applications are good alternatives to standard practice. Examples are interactive blood glucose management with remote care using smartphones, telephone screening for postnatal depression, and Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy. Apps and exercise programs show a direction toward less gestational weight gain, increase in step count, and increase in smoking abstinence. Multiple studies describe novel systems to enable home fetal monitoring with cardiotocography and uterine activity. However, only few studies assess outcomes in terms of fetal monitoring safety and efficacy in high-risk pregnancy. Patients and clinicians report good overall satisfaction with new strategies that enable the shift from hospital-centered to patient-centered care. CONCLUSIONS: This review showed that eHealth interventions have a very broad, multilevel field of application focused on perinatal care in all its aspects. Most of the reviewed 71 articles were published after 2013, suggesting this novel type of care is an important topic of clinical and scientific relevance. Despite the promising preliminary results as presented, we accentuate the need for evidence for health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and the impact on costs of the possibilities of eHealth interventions in perinatal care. In general, the combination of increased patient empowerment and home pregnancy care could lead to more satisfaction and efficiency. Despite the challenges of privacy, liability, and costs, eHealth is very likely to disperse globally in the next decade, and it has the potential to deliver a revolution in perinatal care."
10.2196/64454,Client Perspectives of Case Stories in Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Public Safety Personnel: Mixed Methods Study,"Price JA, Gregory J, McCall HC, Landry CA, Beahm JD, Hadjistavropoulos HD.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.10.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is an effective and convenient means of offering cognitive behavioral therapy to the general population. To increase access to ICBT among Canadian public safety personnel (PSP)-a group that experiences elevated rates of mental health concerns and barriers to mental health care-a clinical research unit called PSPNET has tailored ICBT to PSP, primarily through offering case stories and PSP-specific examples within an ICBT program. PSPNET's first and most frequently used ICBT program, called the PSP Wellbeing Course, has been found to reduce symptoms of mental disorders (eg, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress) among PSP. Little research, however, has investigated clients' perceptions of the case stories in this course. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to expand the literature on the use and evaluation of case stories in ICBT among PSP. Specifically, this study investigated (1) PSP's perceptions of the case stories using the theoretical model provided by Shaffer and Zikmund-Fisher and (2) PSP feedback on the case stories in the PSP Wellbeing Course. METHODS: This study included 41 clients who completed the PSP Wellbeing Course. Of these, 27 clients completed a bespoke questionnaire called the Stories Questionnaire, 10 of whom also participated in a semistructured interview. RESULTS: Findings show that perceptions of the case stories in the PSP Wellbeing Course were largely positive and that the case stories were generally successful in achieving the 5 purposes of case stories (ie, informing, comforting, modeling, engaging, and persuading) proposed by Shaffer and Zikmund-Fisher. Client feedback also identified 3 tangible areas for story improvement: characters, content, and delivery. Each area highlights the need for and potential benefits of story development. Not all PSP engaged with the case stories, though, so results must be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study adds to the growing body of research supporting the use of case stories in internet-delivered interventions among PSP.

10.1016/j.invent.2023.100667,A text messaging intervention to support the mental health of young adults: User engagement and feedback from a field trial of an intervention prototype,"Kornfield R, Stamatis CA, Bhattacharjee A, Pang B, Nguyen T, Williams JJ, Kumar H, Popowski S, Beltzer M, Karr CJ, Reddy M, Mohr DC, Meyerhoff J.",Internet Interv,2023,2023.9.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Young adults have high rates of mental health conditions, but most do not want or cannot access treatment. By leveraging a medium that young adults routinely use, text messaging programs have potential to keep young adults engaged with content supporting self-management of mental health issues and can be delivered inexpensively at scale. We designed an intervention that imparts strategies for self-managing mental health symptoms through interactive text messaging dialogues and engages users through novelty and variety in strategies (from cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and positive psychology) and styles of interaction (e.g., prompts, peer stories, writing tasks). METHODS: The aim of this mixed-methods study was to pilot 1- and 2-week versions of an interactive text messaging intervention among young adults (ages 18-25), and to obtain feedback to guide intervention refinements. Young adults were recruited via a mental health advocacy website and snowball sampling at a North American University. We used Wizard-of-Oz methods in which study staff sent messages based on a detailed script. Transcripts of interviews were subject to qualitative analysis to identify aspects of the program that need improvements, and to gather participant perspectives on possible solutions. RESULTS: Forty-eight individuals ages 18-25 participated in the study (mean age: 22.0). 85 % responded to the program at least once. Among those who ever responded, they replied to messages on 85 % of days, and with engagement sustained over the study period. Participants endorsed the convenience of text messaging, the types of interactive dialogues, and the variety of content. They also identified needed improvements to message volume, scheduling, and content. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults showed high levels of engagement and satisfaction with a texting program supporting mental health self-management. The program may be improved through refining personalization, timing, and message volume, and extending content to support use over a longer timeframe. If shown to be effective in randomized trials, this program has potential to help address a substantial treatment gap in young adults' mental health."

This trial aimed to simultaneously examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and light dark therapy (LDT), targeting different mechanisms, against treatment-as-usual (TAU), in reducing maternal postpartum insomnia symptoms. METHODS: This three-arm randomised controlled trial recruited from the general community in Australia. Nulliparous females 4-12 months postpartum with self-reported insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores >7] were included; severe medical/psychiatric conditions were excluded. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to CBT, LDT, or TAU stratified by ISI (< or ⩾14) and infant age (< or ⩾8 months). Participants and principal investigators were unblinded. Six-week interventions were delivered via digital materials and telephone. The primary outcome was insomnia symptoms (ISI), assessed pre-, midpoint-, post- (primary endpoint), and one-month post-intervention. Analyses were intention-to-treat using latent growth models. RESULTS: 114 participants (CBT = 39, LDT = 36, TAU = 39; Mage = 32.20 ± 4.62 years) were randomised. There were significantly greater reductions in ISI scores in CBT and LDT (effect sizes -2.01 and -1.52 respectively, p < 0.001) from baseline to post-intervention compared to TAU; improvements were maintained at follow-up. Similar effects were observed for self-reported sleep disturbance. There were greater reductions in fatigue in CBT (effect size = 0.85, p < 0.001) but not LDT (p = 0.11) compared to TAU. Changes in sleepiness, depression, and anxiety were non-significant compared to TAU (all p > 0.08). Four participants (11%) in the LDT group reported headaches, dizziness, or nausea; no others reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Therapist-assisted CBT and LDT were feasible during the first postpartum year; data at post-intervention and 1-month follow-up support their safety and efficacy in reducing postpartum insomnia symptoms."

Existing treatments often do not work well enough. We developed a face-to-face theory-driven psychological intervention, called Feeling Safe, that produces very large reductions in persistent persecutory delusions. The challenge now is to make Feeling Safe widely available. So, we developed a 6-month supported online version, called Feeling Safer. The aim is an intervention that patients can easily access and use, reduces persecutory delusions and can be supported by a range of mental health professionals in less contact time than face-to-face therapy. Initial proof of concept testing of Feeling Safer was very encouraging. In a randomised controlled trial, we now plan to test whether Feeling Safer is efficacious for patients and can be successfully delivered by any of three different mental health staff groups (peer-support workers, graduate psychologists and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) therapists). We will also test whether Feeling Safer works equally across gender, age, ethnicity and cognitive functioning (moderation) and whether Feeling Safer works via the targeted psychological processes (mediation). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a multicentre, single-blind (outcome assessor), parallel, four-arm randomised controlled trial; 484 patients with persistent persecutory delusions will be randomised to one of the four conditions (1:1:1:1): Feeling Safer (added to treatment as usual (TAU)) supported by peer-support workers, or Feeling Safer (added to TAU) supported by graduate mental health workers including assistant psychologists, or Feeling Safer (added to TAU) supported by CBT therapists or TAU. Feeling Safer will be provided for 6 months with a staff member. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months by research assistants blind to group allocation. The primary outcome is severity of persecutory delusions at 6 months rated with the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale-Delusions. The secondary outcomes are other psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia, agoraphobia and paranoia), psychological well-being, recovery, activity and health-related quality of life. Analysis will be conducted under a treatment policy strategy following the intention-to-treat principle, incorporating data from all participants including those who do not complete treatment. Moderation and mediation will be tested. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted of Feeling Safer compared with TAU. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS Health Research Authority (23/LO/0951). Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. A key output will be an open-access publication in a peer-reviewed journal reporting on the clinical effectiveness of a high-quality supported online programme for the treatment of persecutory delusions that has the potential to be used at scale in mental health services.

Since foods vary considerably between regions and cultures in which patients live, cultural adaptation of the treatment program is particularly important in cognitive behavioral therapy for BN. Recently, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) program was developed for Japanese women with BN, adapted to the Japanese food culture. However, no previous randomized controlled trial has examined the effectiveness of ICBT. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a research protocol for strategies to examine the effects of guided ICBT. METHODS: This study is designed as a multicenter, prospective, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. The treatment groups will be divided into treatment as usual (TAU) alone as the control group and ICBT combined with TAU as the intervention group. The primary outcome is the total of binge eating and purging behaviors assessed before and after treatment by an independent assessor. Secondary outcomes will include measures of eating disorder severity, depression, anxiety, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and working alliances. Treatment satisfaction and working alliances will be measured post assessment only. Other measures will be assessed at baseline, post intervention, and follow-up, and the outcomes will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: This study will be conducted at 7 different medical institutions in Japan from August 2022 to October 2026. Recruitment of participants began on August 19, 2022, and recruitment is scheduled to continue until July 2024. The first participants were registered on September 8, 2022.

10.2196/52427,Developing a Novel Web-Based Self-Management Support Intervention for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Mixed Methods Study With Patients and Health Care Professionals,"Percy C, Turner A, Orr C.",JMIR Form Res,2024,2024.3.7,,,"BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents a significant global health burden requiring urgent attention. This common chronic endocrine and cardiometabolic condition affects around 1 in 10 women and individuals assigned female at birth, with significant adverse effects on well-being, quality of life, and mental health, as well as serious and complex long-term health consequences. International guidelines for best health care practice recommend the provision of comprehensive cognitive behavioral interventions to support self-management and improve health outcomes for those living with PCOS. Web-based health interventions have the potential to meet this need in an accessible and scalable way. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify barriers to self-management and psychological well-being in women with PCOS and adapt a web-based self-management program to provide a prototype digital support intervention for them. METHODS: We adapted an existing support program (HOPE) for PCOS using the antecedent target measure approach. We conducted qualitative interviews with 13 adult women living with PCOS, 3 trustees of a patients with PCOS advocacy charity, and 4 endocrinologists to identify ""antecedents"" (barriers) to self-management and psychological well-being. Framework analysis was used to identify potentially modifiable antecedents to be targeted by the novel intervention. At a national conference, 58 key stakeholders (patients and health professionals) voted for the antecedents they felt were most important to address. We used research evidence and relevant theory to design a prototype for the PCOS intervention. RESULTS: Voting identified 32 potentially modifiable antecedents, relating to knowledge, understanding, emotions, motivation, and behaviors, as priorities to be targeted in the new intervention. A modular, web-based prototype HOPE PCOS intervention was developed to address these, covering six broad topic areas (instilling HOPE for PCOS; managing the stress of PCOS; feeding your mind and body well; body image, intimacy, and close relationships; staying healthy with PCOS; and keeping PCOS in its place). CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers to self-management and psychological well-being in women with PCOS and used these to adapt a web-based self-management program, tailoring it for PCOS, which is a comprehensive group intervention combining education, empowerment, lifestyle management, peer support with cognitive behavioral tools, and goal-setting (to be delivered by peers or codelivered with health care professionals). The modular structure offers flexibility to adapt the program further as new clinical recommendations emerge. The intervention has the potential to be delivered, evaluated for feasibility, and, if effective, integrated into health care services. Self-management interventions are not designed to replace clinical care; rather, they serve as an additional source of support. The HOPE PCOS program conveys this message in its content and activities. Future research should evaluate the prototype intervention using primary outcomes such as measures of psychological well-being, self-management self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and PCOS-related quality of life. They should also assess the intervention's acceptability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness."

Despite their impact, they are often overlooked in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of infant regulatory problems in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 451 mother-infant pairs from February 15 to March 15, 2022. Regulatory problems were assessed using diagnostic interviews for regulatory problems. The data was collected using an open data kit Android application and analyzed with Stata version 17.0. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were computed to identify factors associated with each infant regulatory problem. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: In this study, four hundred forty-nine mother-infant pairs were involved, with a response rate of 99.5%. The prevalence of excessive crying, feeding problems, and sleeping difficulties was 14.03% [95% CI: 10.95, 17.59], 20.04% [95% CI: 16.44, 24.05], and 13.59% [95% CI: 10.55, 17.11], respectively.

In addition, a family size of above five (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.22), excessive crying (AOR: 3.76, 95% CI: 1.85, 7.65), sleeping problems (AOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.13, 4.65), comorbid DAS symptoms (AOR: 3.42, 95% CI: 1.64, 7.11), alcohol abuse (AOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.42), and late initiation of complementary feeding (AOR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.22, 5.88) were associated with feeding problems. Furthermore, attending primary education (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.77), feeding problems (AOR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.86, 6.48), and comorbid DAS symptoms (AOR: 3.23, 95% CI: 1.53, 6.84) were associated with sleeping problems. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of infants encountered at least one regulatory problem. Level of education, perceived social support, feeding problems, and DAS symptoms were associated with excessive crying. Large family sizes, excessive crying, sleeping problems, comorbid DAS symptoms, alcohol abuse and, late initiation of complementary feeding increase the likelihood of feeding problems. Moreover, attending primary education, feeding problems, and comorbid DAS symptoms increase the odds of sleeping problems. Continuous guidance and support on infant soothing techniques, cognitive and behavioral therapy, and counselling on appropriate coping strategies for postpartum women are imperative to reduce the burden of infant regulatory problems."

Participants were randomly assigned to either the 7-week TCBP program integrating cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, pain education, and self-management strategies or an attention control group focused on general burn recovery information. Assessments conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and 2- and 5-month follow-ups included measures of pain severity, pain interference, pain self-efficacy, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and depression. Compared to the control group, participants in the TCBP program demonstrated greater reductions in pain severity (mean difference: -1.24, 95 % CI: -1.93 to -0.55, p = 0.0007) and pain catastrophizing (mean difference: -5.41, 95 % CI: -10.33 to -0.49, p = 0.0318) post-treatment when adjusting for key variables. At the two-month follow-up, the TCBP group showed significant improvements in pain interference (P = 0.0123), self-efficacy (P = 0.0269), functional abilities (P = 0.0014), and social role participation (P = 0.0498) compared to the control group. Treatment effects were not sustained at 5-month follow-up. Participants in both groups reported high levels of satisfaction with the online intervention, with the majority finding the program helpful and easy to use, and being willing to recommend it to others with pain. Findings suggest preliminary support for short-term benefits of TCBP for managing certain facets of chronic burn pain. This underscores the need to refine digital approaches to maintain and promote long-term improvements. The potential of self-guided online psychological interventions to enhance pain coping strategies for burn survivors persists."
10.1111/jsr.13604,Insomnia disorder: State of the science and challenges for the future,"Riemann D, Benz F, Dressle RJ, Espie CA, Johann AF, Blanken TF, Leerssen J, Wassing R, Henry AL, Kyle SD, Spiegelhalder K, Van Someren EJW.",J Sleep Res,2022,2022.4.23,,,"Insomnia disorder comprises symptoms during night and day that strongly affect quality of life and wellbeing. Prolonged sleep latency, difficulties to maintain sleep and early morning wakening characterize sleep complaints, whereas fatigue, reduced attention, impaired cognitive functioning, irritability, anxiety and low mood are key daytime impairments. Insomnia disorder is well acknowledged in all relevant diagnostic systems: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, 5th revision, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd version, and International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision. Insomnia disorder as a chronic condition is frequent (up to 10% of the adult population, with a preponderance of females), and signifies an important and independent risk factor for physical and, especially, mental health. Insomnia disorder diagnosis primarily rests on self-report. Objective measures like actigraphy or polysomnography are not (yet) part of the routine diagnostic canon, but play an important role in research. Disease concepts of insomnia range from cognitive-behavioural models to (epi-) genetics and psychoneurobiological approaches. The latter is derived from knowledge about basic sleep-wake regulation and encompass theories like rapid eye movement sleep instability/restless rapid eye movement sleep. Cognitive-behavioural models of insomnia led to the conceptualization of cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, which is now considered as first-line treatment for insomnia worldwide. Future research strategies will include the combination of experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and may benefit from more attention to dysfunctional overnight alleviation of distress in insomnia. With respect to therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia merits widespread implementation, and digital cognitive-behavioural therapy may assist delivery along treatment guidelines. However, given the still considerable proportion of patients responding insufficiently to cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, fundamental studies are highly necessary to better understand the brain and behavioural mechanisms underlying insomnia. Mediators and moderators of treatment response/non-response and the associated development of tailored and novel interventions also require investigation. Recent studies suggest that treatment of insomnia may prove to add significantly as a preventive strategy to combat the global burden of mental disorders."

Such sleep difficulties are a problem in their own right, but increasingly it is being recognised that they may also be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Our focus is upon the relationship between insomnia and psychotic experiences, such as paranoia and hallucinations. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms in the general population and have been linked to disrupted sleep. These psychotic-like experiences raise the risk of development of a clinical disorder. Our aim is to reduce insomnia in a large general population group, and examine the effect on paranoia and hallucinations at the age when mental health problems typically emerge. The primary hypotheses are that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for insomnia will reduce insomnia and also levels of paranoia and hallucinations. The theoretical links will be substantiated by a planned mediation analysis. Improvements in a number of other mental health outcomes are also predicted. METHODS/DESIGN: We will carry out a parallel group, randomised controlled trial of 2,614 students with insomnia in universities across the UK. In the Oxford Access for Students Improving Sleep (OASIS) trial, participants will be randomised to digital CBT for insomnia (in addition to treatment as usual) or treatment as usual. Online assessments will take place at zero, three, 10 (post-treatment), and 22 (follow-up) weeks. Primary outcomes are insomnia and psychotic-like experiences (paranoia or hallucinatory experiences) at 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes are levels of mania, depression, anxiety, nightmares, psychological wellbeing, and the development of mental health disorders. All main analyses will be carried out at the end of the last follow-up assessment and will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The trial is funded by the Wellcome Trust. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first large-scale causal test of the relationship between sleep disturbance and psychotic experiences. It will provide evidence concerning the clinical effects of treating insomnia in young adults.

The accessibility of cognitive behavioural interventions could be further improved by Internet delivery, but self-guided interventions have shown limited efficacy. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a therapist guided internet-delivered intervention (TG-iConquerFear) vs. augmented treatment as usual (aTAU) in Danish colorectal cancer survivors. METHODS/DESIGN: A population-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing TG-iConquerFear with aTAU (1:1) in n = 246 colorectal cancer survivors who suffer from clinically significant FCR (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Short Form (FCRI-SF) ≥ 22 and semi-structured interview). Evaluation will be conducted at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-treatment and between-group differences will be evaluated. Long-term effects will be evaluated after one year.

High levels of anxiety disorders have been reported in university students, affecting 25 to 30% of the population. Young adults are some of the most vulnerable for the onset of mental health disorders and any stressors may act as a catalyst for their onset. The absence of resources can often mean that many do not seek treatment. Other factors that impede access to resources include such things as a lack of trained professionals, personal stigma, and waiting lists. Anxiety disorders can be treated successfully; indeed brief forms of cognitive-behavior therapy have been recommended. One potential avenue for research and development is that of delivering low-intensity interventions online for students with GAD. Therefore, the current study seeks to investigate the potential effectiveness for a low-intensity online CBT-based treatment for GAD in a service-based setting; implemented as one step in a stepped-care model. METHODS/DESIGN: The research is a service-based effectiveness study utilizing a randomized waiting-list controlled design. The active intervention consists of six weekly modules of online CBT. Participants are assigned a supporter who provides weekly post-session feedback on progress and exercises. Participants will complete the GAD-7 as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes include pathological worry, depression and measures of well-being. At three-months follow-up data will be collected using the GAD-7, BDI-II, PSWQ, ED-Q5 and WSAS. Post-session data will be collected on significant in-session events in treatment (HAT). A satisfaction with treatment measure will be administered post-treatment (SAT). DISCUSSION: The study will be a contribution to the potential for a low-intensity internet-delivered program implemented in a service-based setting; implemented as one step in a stepped-care model. The study will be a contribution to the already established work in online treatments for anxiety worldwide. The study will assess the utility of an innovative digital health solution (SilverCloud) to deliver such interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN16303842."
10.1186/s13063-025-08781-2,Intensive smoking cessation treatment as an adjunct to concurrent psychotherapy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Sünkel ET, Machulska A, Neubert M, Klucken T.",Trials,2025,2025.3.3,,,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is globally recognized by the World Health Organization as the foremost risk factor for premature mortality. Individuals with mental disorders exhibit a notably heightened dependence on tobacco, approximately twice as high as that of the general population. The long-term effects of nicotine consumption include an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a decline in mental health, which can be considered additional risk factors for the vulnerable population of smokers with preexisting mental disorders. Successful smoking cessation is associated with an increase in mental health, comparable or superior to that of pharmacological antidepressant treatments. However, smoking is frequently disregarded within the realm of psychotherapeutic care, unlike in the treatment of other substance use disorders. Smoking may hinder patients' recovery and responsiveness to psychotherapy, potentially distorting improvements in symptom severity or negative affect. Integrating smoking cessation initiatives into standard psychotherapeutic interventions thus holds significant potential and may be considered essential for long-term mental health. The current study's objective is to assess the potential of a guideline-based smoking cessation intervention within an outpatient psychotherapeutic setting concerning changes in smoking intensity, nicotine dependence, and mental health outcomes among patients with a mental disorder adjunct to concurrent psychotherapy. This trial aims to bridge the gap between the state of research in light of evidence of the positive effects of successful smoking cessation and the actual practical provision of care in Germany. METHODS: The effects of an intensified smoking cessation intervention versus a treatment-as-usual (TAU) control intervention on smokers' smoking intensity, nicotine dependence, and mental health symptoms related to a primary mental disorder will be examined in a single-center randomized controlled trial in an outpatient psychotherapeutic clinic using variance analysis methods. In this case, TAU is referred to as regular psychotherapy sessions without any additional smoking cessation treatment. The smoking intervention consists of a common guideline-based cognitive-behavioral program supplemented by a digital health application. Secondary outcomes include patients' motivation to quit, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward online interventions. Potential moderators or mediators will be investigated in exploratory analyses. DISCUSSION: This study aims to elucidate the potential benefits of integrating smoking cessation interventions into standard psychotherapeutic treatment, akin to approaches used for other substance use disorders. While existing research highlights the positive impact of smoking cessation on mental health, its practical implications within the field of psychotherapy remain unclear. To address this gap, the current study examines the effectiveness of an intensive smoking cessation program alongside ongoing psychotherapy, focusing on both smoking status and mental health outcomes. By doing so, we aim to provide practical insights for psychotherapeutic providers regarding the integration of smoking cessation into comprehensive mental health care.

However, >70% of patients have low PA levels before MBS that persist after MBS. Although behavioral interventions delivered face-to-face have shown promise for increasing PA among patients who have undergone MBS, many may experience barriers, preventing enrollment into and adherence to such interventions. Delivering PA behavior change interventions via telehealth to patients who have undergone MBS may be an effective strategy to increase accessibility and reach, as well as adherence. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the protocol for a study that aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the protocol or methods and the Telehealth Bariatric Behavioral Intervention (TELE-BariACTIV). The intervention is designed to increase moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) in patients awaiting bariatric surgery and is guided by a multitheory approach and a patient perspective. Another objective is to estimate the effect of the TELE-BariACTIV intervention on presurgical MVPA to determine the appropriate sample size for a multicenter trial. METHODS: This study is a multicenter trial using a repeated (ABAB'A) single-case experimental design. The A phases are observational phases without intervention (A1=pre-MBS phase; A2=length personalized according to the MBS date; A3=7 months post-MBS phase). The B phases are interventional phases with PA counseling (B1=6 weekly pre-MBS sessions; B2=3 monthly sessions starting 3 months after MBS). The target sample size is set to 12. Participants are inactive adults awaiting sleeve gastrectomy who have access to a computer with internet and an interface with a camera. The participants are randomly allocated to a 1- or 2-week baseline period (A1). Protocol and intervention feasibility and acceptability (primary outcomes) will be assessed by recording missing data, refusal, recruitment, retention, attendance, and attrition rates, as well as via web-based acceptability questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Data collected via accelerometry (7-14 days) on 8 occasions and via questionnaires on 10 occasions will be analyzed to estimate the effect of the intervention on MVPA. Generalization measures assessing the quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and theory-based constructs (ie, motivational regulations for PA, self-efficacy to overcome barriers to PA, basic psychological needs satisfaction and frustration, PA enjoyment, and social support for PA; secondary outcomes for a future large-scale trial) will be completed via web-based questionnaires on 6-10 occasions. The institutional review board provided ethics approval for the study in June 2021. RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2021, and all the participants were enrolled (n=12). Data collection is expected to end in fall 2023, depending on the MBS date of the recruited participants. CONCLUSIONS: The TELE-BariACTIV intervention has the potential for implementation across multiple settings owing to its collaborative construction that can be offered remotely.

Commonly reported complaints include physical symptoms such as fatigue, headache, attention and concentration deficits or dyspnea and anxiety, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, or depression. Evidence-based treatment recommendations are still lacking up to this point. Associations between physical and psychological symptoms in chronic diseases are known for a long time. Support in coping with the disease and improvement of self-efficacy can have a positive effect on the course of diseases. For this reason, we designed a randomized, controlled explorative intervention trial as a treatment of bodily distress disorder in COVID-19 recovered persons. METHODS: Patients with a post COVID-19 condition meeting to the criteria of the WHO, along with a bodily distress disorder, are randomized in an intervention and control arm (TAU). Randomization takes place after a diagnostic interview, screening, and informed consent. In total, 60 patients will be included in the trial (30 per group). The intervention group receives a cognitive behavioral therapy as a video-conference-based group therapy (6 weeks) and mobile, respiratory biofeedback treatment (for 4 weeks). At several time points, both groups are assessed in terms of psychological and physical health status, treatment expectation, and satisfaction with the intervention. Furthermore, they will get biofeedback examination appointments. The primary outcome is the change in self-efficacy; secondary outcomes include assessed parameters of mental health, somatic symptoms, and satisfaction with the intervention. Data will be analyzed primarily using R and SPSS. DISCUSSION: The randomized, controlled, explorative intervention trial POSITIV is one of the very first interventions for patients with post COVID-19 condition and psychological burden due to their different symptoms. The aim of the study is to generate new evidence and help patients to cope with the disease and thus, increase their quality of life and reduce symptomatology.

Its high prevalence among college students comes with serious consequences for mental health and well-being of those affected. Research for proper treatment is still relatively scarce and treatment of choice seems to be cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of an internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) for procrastination based on CBT for college students. METHODS: A two-armed randomized controlled trial with a calculated sample size of N = 120 participants with problematic procrastination behavior will be conducted. Students will be recruited in Germany, Austria and Switzerland via circular emails at 15+ cooperating universities in the framework of StudiCare, a well-established project that provides IMIs to college students for different health related issues.

Offering a Web-based self-help tool could potentially reach users who otherwise would not seek traditional help. However, such Web-based self-help tools often suffer from low adherence. OBJECTIVE: Through adherence-focused guidance enhancements, the aim of this study was to increase adherence in cannabis users entering a Web-based self-help tool to reduce their cannabis use and, in this way, augment its effectiveness. METHODS: This paper presents the protocol for a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effectiveness of (1) an adherence-focused, guidance-enhanced, Web-based self-help intervention with social presence; (2) an adherence-focused, guidance-enhanced, Web-based self-help intervention without social presence; and (3) a treatment-as-usual at reducing cannabis use in problematic users. The two active interventions, each spanning 6 weeks, consist of modules designed to reduce cannabis use and attenuate common mental disorder (CMD) symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorder symptoms based on the approaches of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. With a target sample size of 528, data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months after baseline. The primary outcome measurement will be the number of days of cannabis use on the preceding 7 days. Secondary outcomes will include the quantity of cannabis used in standardized cannabis joints, the severity of cannabis dependence, changes in CMD symptoms, and adherence to the program. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and employ (generalized) linear mixed models. RESULTS: The project commenced in August 2016; recruitment is anticipated to end by December 2018. First results are expected to be submitted for publication in summer 2019.

10.2196/64396,The Efficacy of Conversational AI in Rectifying the Theory-of-Mind and Autonomy Biases: Comparative Analysis,"Rządeczka M, Sterna A, Stolińska J, Kaczyńska P, Moskalewicz M.",JMIR Ment Health,2025,2025.2.7,,,"BACKGROUND: The increasing deployment of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health interventions necessitates an evaluation of their efficacy in rectifying cognitive biases and recognizing affect in human-AI interactions. These biases are particularly relevant in mental health contexts as they can exacerbate conditions such as depression and anxiety by reinforcing maladaptive thought patterns or unrealistic expectations in human-AI interactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic chatbots (Wysa and Youper) versus general-purpose language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro) in identifying and rectifying cognitive biases and recognizing affect in user interactions. METHODS: This study used constructed case scenarios simulating typical user-bot interactions to examine how effectively chatbots address selected cognitive biases. The cognitive biases assessed included theory-of-mind biases (anthropomorphism, overtrust, and attribution) and autonomy biases (illusion of control, fundamental attribution error, and just-world hypothesis). Each chatbot response was evaluated based on accuracy, therapeutic quality, and adherence to cognitive behavioral therapy principles using an ordinal scale to ensure consistency in scoring. To enhance reliability, responses underwent a double review process by 2 cognitive scientists, followed by a secondary review by a clinical psychologist specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy, ensuring a robust assessment across interdisciplinary perspectives. RESULTS: This study revealed that general-purpose chatbots outperformed therapeutic chatbots in rectifying cognitive biases, particularly in overtrust bias, fundamental attribution error, and just-world hypothesis. GPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all biases, whereas the therapeutic bot Wysa scored the lowest. Notably, general-purpose bots showed more consistent accuracy and adaptability in recognizing and addressing bias-related cues across different contexts, suggesting a broader flexibility in handling complex cognitive patterns. In addition, in affect recognition tasks, general-purpose chatbots not only excelled but also demonstrated quicker adaptation to subtle emotional nuances, outperforming therapeutic bots in 67% (4/6) of the tested biases. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, while therapeutic chatbots hold promise for mental health support and cognitive bias intervention, their current capabilities are limited. Addressing cognitive biases in AI-human interactions requires systems that can both rectify and analyze biases as integral to human cognition, promoting precision and simulating empathy. The findings reveal the need for improved simulated emotional intelligence in chatbot design to provide adaptive, personalized responses that reduce overreliance and encourage independent coping skills. Future research should focus on enhancing affective response mechanisms and addressing ethical concerns such as bias mitigation and data privacy to ensure safe, effective AI-based mental health support."

This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based, self-guided alcohol and anxiety-focused program, compared with a web-based brief alcohol-focused program, for young adults who drink at hazardous levels and experience anxiety. It will also test moderators and mechanisms of change underlying the intervention effects. DESIGN: This RCT will be conducted with a 1:1 parallel group. SETTING: The study will be a web-based trial in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 17-30 years who drink alcohol at hazardous or greater levels and experience at least mild anxiety (n = 500) will be recruited through social media, media (TV, print) and community networks. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive a web-based, integrated alcohol-anxiety program plus technical and motivational telephone/e-mail support (intervention) or a web-based brief alcohol-feedback program (control). MEASUREMENTS: Clinical measures will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (2 months), 6 months (primary end-point), 12 months and 18 months. Co-primary outcomes are hazardous alcohol consumption and anxiety symptom severity. Secondary outcomes are binge-drinking frequency; alcohol-related consequences; depression symptoms; clinical diagnoses of alcohol use or anxiety disorder (at 6 months post-intervention), health-care service use, educational and employment outcomes; and quality of life. Mediators and moderators will also be assessed. Efficacy will be tested using mixed models for repeated measures within an intention-to-treat framework. The economic evaluation will analyze individual-level health and societal costs and outcomes of participants between each trial arm, while mediation models will test for mechanisms of change. COMMENTS: This will be the first trial to test whether a developmentally targeted, web-based, integrated alcohol-anxiety intervention is effective in reducing hazardous alcohol use and anxiety severity among young adults. If successful, the integrated alcohol-anxiety program will provide an accessible intervention that can be widely disseminated to improve wellbeing of young adults, at minimal cost."

Globally millions of AYA are living with HIV (AYALH) and/or have been affected by HIV in their families (AYAAH), with studies highlighting the need for mental health programmes. With no current guidelines for delivering mental health interventions for AYALH or AYAAH, a scoping review was undertaken to explore current evidence-based mental health interventions for AYALH and AYAAH to inform future work. METHODS: The review, targeting work between 2014 and 2020, initially included studies of evidence-based mental health interventions for AYALH and AYAAH, ages 10 to 24 years, that used traditional mental health treatments. Given the few studies identified, we expanded our search to include psychosocial interventions that had mental health study outcomes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 13 studies, seven focused on AYALH, five on AYAAH, and one on both. Most studies took place in sub-Saharan Africa. Depression was targeted in eight studies with the remainder focused on a range of emotional and behavioural symptoms. Few studies used evidence-based approaches such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy; psychosocial approaches included mental health treatments, group-based and family strengthening interventions, economic empowerment combined with family strengthening, group-based mindfulness and community interventions. Eleven studies were randomized control trials with four pilot studies. There was variation in sample size, treatment delivery mode (individual focus, group-based, family focus), and measures of effectiveness across studies. Most used trained lay counsellors as facilitators, with few using trained mental health professionals. Eleven studies reported positive intervention effects on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for mental health interventions for AYALH and AYAAH, we know surprisingly little about mental health treatment for this vulnerable population. There are some promising approaches, but more work is needed to identify evidence-based approaches and corresponding mechanisms of change. Given limited resources, integrating mental health treatment into healthcare settings and using digital health approaches may support more standardized and scalable treatments. Greater emphasis on implementation science frameworks is needed to create sustainable mental health treatment for AYALH and AYAAH globally."

BACKGROUND: Social networking platforms offer a wide reach for public health interventions allowing communication with broad audiences using tools that are generally free and straightforward to use and may be combined with other components, such as public health policies. We define interactive social media as activities, practices, or behaviours among communities of people who have gathered online to interactively share information, knowledge, and opinions. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of interactive social media interventions, in which adults are able to communicate directly with each other, on changing health behaviours, body functions, psychological health, well-being, and adverse effects. Our secondary objective was to assess the effects of these interventions on the health of populations who experience health inequity as defined by PROGRESS-Plus. We assessed whether there is evidence about PROGRESS-Plus populations being included in studies and whether results are analysed across any of these characteristics. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE (including trial registries) and PsycINFO. We used Google, Web of Science, and relevant web sites to identify additional studies and searched reference lists of included studies. We searched for published and unpublished studies from 2001 until June 1, 2020. We did not limit results by language. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs). We included studies in which the intervention website, app, or social media platform described a goal of changing a health behaviour, or included a behaviour change technique. The social media intervention had to be delivered to adults via a commonly-used social media platform or one that mimicked a commonly-used platform. We included studies comparing an interactive social media intervention alone or as a component of a multi-component intervention with either a non-interactive social media control or an active but less-interactive social media comparator (e.g. a moderated versus an unmoderated discussion group). Our main outcomes were health behaviours (e.g. physical activity), body function outcomes (e.g. blood glucose), psychological health outcomes (e.g. depression), well-being, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were process outcomes important for behaviour change and included knowledge, attitudes, intention and motivation, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and social support. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used a pre-tested data extraction form and collected data independently, in duplicate. Because we aimed to assess broad outcomes, we extracted only one outcome per main and secondary outcome categories prioritised by those that were the primary outcome as reported by the study authors, used in a sample size calculation, and patient-important. MAIN RESULTS: We included 88 studies (871,378 participants), of which 84 were RCTs, three were CBAs and one was an ITS. The majority of the studies were conducted in the USA (54%). In total, 86% were conducted in high-income countries and the remaining 14% in upper middle-income countries. The most commonly used social media platform was Facebook (39%) with few studies utilising other platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Google Hangouts. Many studies (48%) used web-based communities or apps that mimic functions of these well-known social media platforms. We compared studies assessing interactive social media interventions with non-interactive social media interventions, which included paper-based or in-person interventions or no intervention. We only reported the RCT results in our 'Summary of findings' table. We found a range of effects on health behaviours, such as breastfeeding, condom use, diet quality, medication adherence, medical screening and testing, physical activity, tobacco use, and vaccination. For example, these interventions may increase physical activity and medical screening tests but there was little to no effect for other health behaviours, such as improved diet or reduced tobacco use (20,139 participants in 54 RCTs). For body function outcomes, interactive social media interventions may result in small but important positive effects, such as a small but important positive effect on weight loss and a small but important reduction in resting heart rate (4521 participants in 30 RCTs). Interactive social media may improve overall well-being (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.79, moderate effect, low-certainty evidence) demonstrated by an increase of 3.77 points on a general well-being scale (from 1.15 to 6.48 points higher) where scores range from 14 to 70 (3792 participants in 16 studies). We found no difference in effect on psychological outcomes (depression and distress) representing a difference of 0.1 points on a standard scale in which scores range from 0 to 63 points (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.12, low-certainty evidence, 2070 participants in 12 RCTs). We also compared studies assessing interactive social media interventions with those with an active but less interactive social media control (11 studies). Four RCTs (1523 participants) that reported on physical activity found an improvement demonstrated by an increase of 28 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week (from 10 to 47 minutes more, SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.59, small effect, very low-certainty evidence). Two studies found little to no difference in well-being for those in the intervention and control groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.13, small effect, low-certainty evidence), demonstrated by a mean change of 0.4 points on a scale with a range of 0 to 100. Adverse events related to the social media component of the interventions, such as privacy issues, were not reported in any of our included studies. We were unable to conduct planned subgroup analyses related to health equity as only four studies reported relevant data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review combined data for a variety of outcomes and found that social media interventions that aim to increase physical activity may be effective and social media interventions may improve well-being. While we assessed many other outcomes, there were too few studies to compare or, where there were studies, the evidence was uncertain. None of our included studies reported adverse effects related to the social media component of the intervention. Future studies should assess adverse events related to the interactive social media component and should report on population characteristics to increase our understanding of the potential effect of these interventions on reducing health inequities."

Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line treatment by clinical guidelines but is accessible to only a minority of patients suffering from insomnia. Internet-delivered CBT-I (iCBT-I) could contribute to the widespread dissemination of this first-line treatment. As there is insufficient evidence regarding non-inferiority, this study directly aims to compare therapist-guided internet-delivered versus face-to-face CBT-I in terms of insomnia severity post-treatment. Furthermore, a health-economic evaluation will be conducted, and potential benefits and disadvantages of therapist-guided iCBT-I will be examined. METHODS: This study protocol describes a randomised controlled two-arm parallel-group non-inferiority trial comparing therapist-guided iCBT-I with face-to-face CBT-I in routine clinical care. A total of 422 patients with insomnia disorder will be randomised and treated at 16 study centres throughout Germany. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 10 weeks after randomisation (post), and 6 months after randomisation (follow-up). The primary outcome is insomnia severity measured using the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary outcomes include depression-related symptoms, quality of life, fatigue, physical activity, daylight exposure, adverse events related to treatment, and a health-economic evaluation. Finally, potential moderator variables and several descriptive and exploratory outcomes will be assessed (e.g. benefits and disadvantages of internet-delivered treatment). DISCUSSION: The widespread implementation of CBT-I is a significant healthcare challenge. The non-inferiority of therapist-guided iCBT-I versus face-to-face CBT-I will be investigated in an adequately powered sample in routine clinical care, with the same therapeutic content and same level of therapist qualifications provided with both interventions. If this trial demonstrates the non-inferiority of therapist-guided iCBT-I, healthcare providers may be more confident recommending this treatment to their patients, contributing to the wider dissemination of CBT-I.

However, the rate of seeking mental health treatment among university students is low. Web-based psychological interventions may provide an opportunity for supporting vulnerable university students who are unlikely to otherwise seek support. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and efficacy of an existing web-based transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) mental health program for use among Australian university students. METHODS: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a self-directed web-based CBT mental health program with a waitlist control. The self-directed modules will be augmented with optional webchat or telephone coaching with a therapist. The recruitment target is 70 university students who do not present with a clinical mental health disorder. Allocation will be made in a 1:1 ratio and will occur after the initial baseline assessment. Assessments will be completed at baseline, upon completion of a 4-week waitlist (waitlist group only), upon completion of the program, and at 3 months after completion of the program. RESULTS: The trial was funded in June 2018, and the protocol was approved by the Swinburne University Human Research Ethics Committee in September 2018. Recruitment commenced in October 2018, with the first participant allocated in November 2018. A total of 70 participants were recruited to the trial. The trial recruitment ceased in June 2019, and data collection was finalized in December 2019. We expect the final data analysis to be completed by November 2020 and results to be published early in 2021. The primary outcomes are feasibility, acceptability, safety, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. The secondary outcomes are psychological wellbeing, quality of life, loneliness, self-reported physical health status, emotion regulation, and cognitive and mindfulness processes. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptability, feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a web-based mental health program in university students will be evaluated. Web-based mental health programs offer the opportunity to engage university students who may be reluctant to seek support through traditional face-to-face mental health services, and the transdiagnostic approach of the program has the potential to address the breadth of mental health concerns of university students.

10.2196/67131,Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Interventions for Caregivers of Patients With Cancer: Scoping Review,"Shen CT, Shi J, Liu FX, Lu XM.",JMIR Cancer,2025,2025.6.4,,,"BACKGROUND: Cancer imposes significant physical and emotional distress not only on patients, but also on their caregivers. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the mental and physical well-being of caregivers. Among various psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is widely recognized as one of the most effective approaches. However, traditional CBT is often limited by time and geographical constraints, resulting in delayed or inefficient support for caregivers. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) presents a valuable alternative for alleviating the caregiving burden and the negative emotions experienced by caregivers. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide a scoping review of ICBT interventions for caregivers of patients with cancer, examining intervention content, outcome measures, and effectiveness and to offer insights and references for the development and clinical applications of ICBT programs tailored to caregivers of patients with cancer in China. METHODS: Relevant literature was systematically searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and VIP Chinese Journal Database. The search timeframe was from database inception to June 6, 2024. Inclusion criteria encompassed intervention studies that implemented cognitive behavioral therapy for caregivers of patients with cancer via the internet, WeChat (Tencent), or mobile electronic devices. This category includes both randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the criteria and were included in the review. The intervention content included the following components: treatment initiation and brief introduction (5/12, 41%), cognitive education and restructuring (7/12, 58%), emotional expression and coping (6/12, 50%), cognitive restructuring and reinforcement (4/12, 33%), behavioral training and activation (9/12, 75%), problem-solving techniques (4/12, 33%), communication (5/12, 41%), and completion of treatment with follow-up consolidation (3/12, 25%). The intervention duration typically ranged from 6 to 8 weeks. Outcome indicators encompassed feasibility and acceptability, anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, and quality of life. ICBT demonstrated positive effects for caregivers of patients with cancer. Most intervention programs were feasible and acceptable, with 2 out of 5 feasibility studies reporting recruitment rates below 50%. Attrition rates across studies ranged from 3% to 16%, and caregivers expressed satisfaction with the information, quality, and skills provided. ICBT exhibits a moderate effect in diminishing negative emotions among caregivers and alleviating caregiver stress. However, its impact on improving quality of life is not statistically significant, underscoring the need for long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of ICBT for caregivers of patients with cancer has demonstrated beneficial outcomes, attributed to its practicality and flexibility, which contribute to its greater acceptance among caregivers. Nevertheless, there is significant heterogeneity in intervention format, duration, and outcome indicators. It is necessary to develop optimal intervention strategies and secure online platforms based on the cultural background in China to improve the quality of life of caregivers."

However, it is not yet known whether iCT-SAD can retain its efficacy following linguistic translation and cultural adaptation of treatment contents and implementation in other countries such as Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of the translated and culturally adapted iCT-SAD in Japanese clinical settings. METHODS: This multicenter, single-arm trial recruited 15 participants with social anxiety disorder. At the time of recruitment, participants were receiving usual psychiatric care but had not shown improvement in their social anxiety and required additional treatment. iCT-SAD was provided in combination with usual psychiatric care for 14 weeks (treatment phase) and for a subsequent 3-month follow-up phase that included up to 3 booster sessions. The primary outcome measure was the self-report version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. The secondary outcome measures examined social anxiety-related psychological processes, taijin kyofusho (the fear of offending others), depression, generalized anxiety, and general functioning. The assessment points for the outcome measures were baseline (week 0), midtreatment (week 8), posttreatment (week 15; primary assessment point), and follow-up (week 26). Acceptability was measured using the dropout rate from the treatment, the level of engagement with the program (the rate of module completion), and participants' feedback about their experience with the iCT-SAD. RESULTS: Evaluation of the outcome measures data showed that iCT-SAD led to significant improvements in social anxiety symptoms during the treatment phase (P<.001; Cohen d=3.66), and these improvements were maintained during the follow-up phase. Similar results were observed for the secondary outcome measures. At the end of the treatment phase, 80% (12/15) of participants demonstrated reliable improvement, and 60% (9/15) of participants demonstrated remission from social anxiety. Moreover, 7% (1/15) of participants dropped out during treatment, and 7% (1/15) of participants declined to undergo the follow-up phase after completing the treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. On average, participants completed 94% of the modules released to them. Participant feedback was positive and highlighted areas of strength in treatment, and it included further suggestions to improve suitability for Japanese settings. CONCLUSIONS: Translated and culturally adapted iCT-SAD demonstrated promising initial efficacy and acceptability for Japanese clients with social anxiety disorder. A randomized controlled trial is required to examine this more robustly."

Psychosocial stress management interventions, shown to mitigate the negative impact of these complaints, can now be delivered as accessible and convenient (for the patient and provider) eHealth interventions. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), Coping After Breast Cancer (CABC), 2 modified versions of the stress management eHealth intervention program StressProffen were created: one with predominantly cognitive behavioral stress management content (StressProffen-cognitive behavioral therapy intervention [StressProffen-CBI]) and another with predominantly mindfulness-based stress management content (StressProffen-mindfulness-based intervention [StressProffen-MBI]). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects in breast cancer survivors of using StressProffen-CBI and StressProffen-MBI compared with a control group (treatment as usual). METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I-III, unequivocally human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative tumors) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) aged 21-69 years who completed the Cancer Registry of Norway-initiated health survey on quality of life are invited to the CABC trial about 7 months after diagnosis. Women who give consent to participate are randomized (1:1:1) to either the StressProffen-CBI, StressProffen-MBI, or control group. Both StressProffen interventions consist of 10 modules of stress management content delivered through text, sound, video, and images. The primary outcome is between-group changes in perceived stress at 6 months, assessed with Cohen 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. The secondary outcomes comprise changes in quality of life, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep, neuropathy, coping, mindfulness, and work-related outcomes approximately 1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis. Long-term effects of the interventions on work participation, comorbidities, relapse or new cancers, and mortality will be assessed using data from national health registries. RESULTS: Recruitment is scheduled from January 2021 to May 2023. The goal is to recruit 430 participants (100 in each group). As of April 14 2023, 428 participants have been enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: The CABC trial is possibly the largest ongoing psychosocial eHealth RCT in patients with breast cancer. If 1 or both interventions prove to be effective in reducing stress and improving psychosocial and physical complains, the StressProffen eHealth interventions could be beneficial, inexpensive, and easily implementable tools for breast cancer survivors when coping with late effects after cancer and cancer treatments.

10.2196/39129,The Effectiveness of Web-Based Psychotherapy to Treat and Prevent Burnout: Controlled Trial,"Michelsen C, Kjellgren A.",JMIR Form Res,2022,2022.7.8,,,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is a hidden productivity killer in organizations. Finding a solution to efficiently measure and proactively prevent or rehabilitate employees with burnout is a challenge. To meet this unabated demand, companies and caregivers can focus on proactive measures to prevent ""Burnout as an Occupational Phenomenon."" OBJECTIVE: We aimed to address effectiveness, reliability, and validity of the empowerment for participation (EFP) batch of assessments to measure burnout risk in relation to the efficacy of web-based interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and floating to improve mental health and well-being. We introduced three risk assessments: risk for burnout, risk of anxiety, and risk for depression. METHODS: We used an interventional, empirical, and parallel design using raw EFP psychometric data to measure the effectiveness of web-based therapy to reduce the risk of burnout between a control group and web-based therapy group. A total of 50 participants were selected. The rehabilitation and control groups consisted of 25 normally distributed employees each. The rehabilitation group received therapy, whereas the control group had not yet received any form of therapy. IBM SPSS was used to analyze the data collected, and a repeated measures ANOVA, an analysis of covariance, a discriminant analysis, and a construct validity analysis were used to test for reliability and validity. The group was selected from a list of employees within the My-E-Health ecosystem who showed a moderate or high risk for burnout. All assessments and mixed-method CBT were web-based, and floating was conducted at designated locations. The complete EFP assessment was integrated into a digital ecosystem designed for this purpose and therapy, offering a secure and encrypted ecosystem. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between pre- and postassessment scores for burnout. The reliability of the burnout measure was good (Cronbach α=.858; mean 1.826, SD 3.008; Cohen d=0.607; P<.001) with a high validity of 0.9420. A paired samples 2-tailed test showed a good t score of 4.292 and P<.001, with a good effect size, Cohen d=0.607. Web-based therapy reduced the risk for burnout in participants compared with the control group. Tests of between-subject effects show F=16.964, a significant difference between the control group and the web-based therapy group: P<.001, with movement between the group variables of 0.261 or 26.1% for the dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests good reliability and validity of using web-based interventional mixed methods CBT to reduce the risk of burnout. The EFP batch of web-based assessments could reliably identify morbidity risk levels and successfully measure clinical interventions and rehabilitation with consistently reliable results to serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool worthy of major research in the future.

10.1016/j.invent.2025.100816,Study protocol for a triple-blind randomised controlled trial evaluating a machine learning-based predictive clinical decision support tool for internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) for depression and anxiety,"Bjurner P, Isacsson NH, Abdesslem FB, Boman M, Forsell E, Kaldo V.",Internet Interv,2025,2025.3.24,,,"INTRODUCTION: Therapist-supported internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) has strong scientific support, but all patients are not helped, and further improvements are needed. Personalized medicine could enhance ICBT. One promising approach uses a Machine learning (ML) based predictive decision support tool (DST) to help therapists identify patients at risk of treatment failure and adjust their treatments accordingly. ICBT is a suitable clinical context for developing and testing such predictive DST's, since its delivery is quite flexible and can quickly be adapted for probable non-responders, for example by increasing the level and nature of therapist support, to avoid treatment failures and improve overall outcomes. This type of strategy has never been tested in a triple-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) and has rarely been studied in ICBT.The aim of this protocol is to expand on previous registered protocols with more detailed descriptions of methods and analyses before analyses is being conducted. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A triple blind RCT comparing ICBT with a DST (DST condition), to ICBT as usual (TAU condition). The primary objective is to evaluate if the DST condition is superior to the TAU condition in decreasing diagnose-specific symptoms among patients identified to be at risk of failure. Secondary objectives are to evaluate if the DST improves functioning, interaction, adherence, patient satisfaction, and therapist time efficiency and decreases the number of failed treatments. Additionally, we will investigate the therapists' experience of using the DST.Patients and therapists have been recruited nationally. They were randomised and given a sham rationale for the trial to ensure allocation blindness. The total number of patients included was 401, and assessments were administered pre-treatment, weekly during treatment, at post-treatment and at 12-month follow-up. Primary outcome is one of the three diagnosis-specific symptom rating scales for respective treatment and primary analysis is difference in change from pre- to post-treatment for at-risk patients on these scales. HUMAN ETHICS AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all participants. Both therapists and patients are participants in this trial. For patients, informed consent to participate in the study was obtained when they registered interest for the study via the study's secure web platform and carried out initial screening before the diagnostic and fit for treatment assessment, they first received the research subject information and were asked for consent by digitally signing that they had read and understood the information. For therapists who were part of the study, consent was requested after they had registered their interest. Therapists then received an email with a link to the study's secure web platform with the research person's information and were asked for consent by digitally signing that they had read and understood the information.

10.2196/28999,Exploratory Data Mining Techniques (Decision Tree Models) for Examining the Impact of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus: Machine Learning Approach,"Rodrigo H, Beukes EW, Andersson G, Manchaiah V.",J Med Internet Res,2021,2021.11.2,,,"BACKGROUND: There is huge variability in the way that individuals with tinnitus respond to interventions. These experiential variations, together with a range of associated etiologies, contribute to tinnitus being a highly heterogeneous condition. Despite this heterogeneity, a ""one size fits all"" approach is taken when making management recommendations. Although there are various management approaches, not all are equally effective. Psychological approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy have the most evidence base. Managing tinnitus is challenging due to the significant variations in tinnitus experiences and treatment successes. Tailored interventions based on individual tinnitus profiles may improve outcomes. Predictive models of treatment success are, however, lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use exploratory data mining techniques (ie, decision tree models) to identify the variables associated with the treatment success of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus. METHODS: Individuals (N=228) who underwent ICBT in 3 separate clinical trials were included in this analysis. The primary outcome variable was a reduction of 13 points in tinnitus severity, which was measured by using the Tinnitus Functional Index following the intervention. The predictor variables included demographic characteristics, tinnitus and hearing-related variables, and clinical factors (ie, anxiety, depression, insomnia, hyperacusis, hearing disability, cognitive function, and life satisfaction). Analyses were undertaken by using various exploratory machine learning algorithms to identify the most influencing variables. In total, 6 decision tree models were implemented, namely the classification and regression tree (CART), C5.0, GB, XGBoost, AdaBoost algorithm and random forest models. The Shapley additive explanations framework was applied to the two optimal decision tree models to determine relative predictor importance. RESULTS: Among the six decision tree models, the CART (accuracy: mean 70.7%, SD 2.4%; sensitivity: mean 74%, SD 5.5%; specificity: mean 64%, SD 3.7%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: mean 0.69, SD 0.001) and gradient boosting (accuracy: mean 71.8%, SD 1.5%; sensitivity: mean 78.3%, SD 2.8%; specificity: 58.7%, SD 4.2%; AUC: mean 0.68, SD 0.02) models were found to be the best predictive models. Although the other models had acceptable accuracy (range 56.3%-66.7%) and sensitivity (range 68.6%-77.9%), they all had relatively weak specificity (range 31.1%-50%) and AUCs (range 0.52-0.62). A higher education level was the most influencing factor for ICBT outcomes. The CART decision tree model identified 3 participant groups who had at least an 85% success probability following the undertaking of ICBT. CONCLUSIONS: Decision tree models, especially the CART and gradient boosting models, appeared to be promising in predicting ICBT outcomes. Their predictive power may be improved by using larger sample sizes and including a wider range of predictive factors in future studies."
10.1016/j.invent.2021.100466,Efficacy of an internet-based psychological intervention for problem gambling and gambling disorder: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Diaz-Sanahuja L, Campos D, Mira A, Castilla D, García-Palacios A, Bretón-López JM.",Internet Interv,2021,2021.10.14,,,"Gambling Disorder is a prevalent non-substance use disorder, which contrasts with the low number of people requesting treatment. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) could help to enhance the dissemination of evidence-based treatments and considerably reduce the costs. The current study seeks to assess the efficacy of an online psychological intervention for people suffering from gambling problems in Spain. The proposed study will be a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. A total of 134 participants (problem and pathological gamblers) will be randomly allocated to a waiting list control group (N = 67) or an intervention group (N = 67). The intervention program includes 8 modules, and it is based on motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and extensions and innovations of CBT. It includes several complementary tools that are present throughout the entire intervention. Therapeutic support will be provided once a week through a phone call with a maximum length of 10 min. The primary outcome measure will be gambling severity and gambling-related cognitions, and secondary outcome measures will be readiness to change, and gambling self-efficacy. Other variables that will be considered are depression and anxiety symptoms, positive and negative affect, difficulties in emotion regulation strategies, impulsivity, and quality of life. Individuals will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. During the treatment, participants will also respond to a daily Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) in order to evaluate urges to gamble, self-efficacy to cope with gambling urges, gambling urge frequency, and whether gambling behaviour occurs. The EMI includes immediate automatic feedback depending on the participant's responses. Treatment acceptance and satisfaction will also be assessed. The data will be analysed both per protocol and by Intention-to-treat. As far as we know, this is the first randomized controlled trial of an online psychological intervention for gambling disorder in Spain. It will expand our knowledge about treatments delivered via the Internet and contribute to improving treatment dissemination, reaching people suffering from this problem who otherwise would not receive help.

10.2196/29666,Effects of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Harmful Alcohol Use and Alcohol Dependence as Self-help or With Therapist Guidance: Three-Armed Randomized Trial,"Johansson M, Berman AH, Sinadinovic K, Lindner P, Hermansson U, Andréasson S.",J Med Internet Res,2021,2021.11.25,,,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a major contributor to health loss. Many persons with harmful use or alcohol dependence do not obtain treatment because of limited availability or stigma. They may use internet-based interventions as an alternative way of obtaining support. Internet-based interventions have previously been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption in studies that included hazardous use; however, few studies have been conducted with a specific focus on harmful use or alcohol dependence. The importance of therapist guidance in internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) programs is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: This trial aims to investigate the effects of a web-based alcohol program with or without therapist guidance among anonymous adult help-seekers. METHODS: A three-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT with an information-only control condition. Swedish-speaking adult internet users with alcohol dependence (3 or more International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision criteria) or harmful alcohol use (alcohol use disorder identification test>15) were included in the study. Participants in the therapist-guided ICBT and self-help ICBT groups had 12-week access to a program consisting of 5 main modules, as well as a drinking calendar with automatic feedback. Guidance was given by experienced therapists trained in motivational interviewing. The primary outcome measure was weekly alcohol consumption in standard drinks (12 g of ethanol). Secondary outcomes were alcohol-related problems measured using the total alcohol use disorder identification test-score, diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence and alcohol use disorder, depression, anxiety, health, readiness to change, and access to other treatments or support. Follow-up was conducted 3 (posttreatment) and 6 months after recruitment. RESULTS: During the recruitment period, from March 2015 to March 2017, 1169 participants were included. Participants had a mean age of 45 (SD 13) years, and 56.72% (663/1169) were women. At the 3-month follow-up, the therapist-guided ICBT and control groups differed significantly in weekly alcohol consumption (-3.84, 95% Cl -6.53 to -1.16; t417=2.81; P=.005; Cohen d=0.27). No significant differences were found in weekly alcohol consumption between the self-help ICBT group and the therapist-guided ICBT at 3 months, between the self-help ICBT and the control group at 3 months, or between any of the groups at the 6-month follow-up. A limitation of the study was the large number of participants who were completely lost to follow-up (477/1169, 40.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a therapist-guided ICBT program was not found to be more effective than the same program in a self-help ICBT version for reducing alcohol consumption or other alcohol-related outcomes. In the short run, therapist-guided ICBT was more effective than information. Only some internet help-seekers may need a multisession program and therapist guidance to change their drinking when they use internet-based interventions.

10.1002/14651858.CD012189,Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults,"Hawton K, Witt KG, Taylor Salisbury TL, Arensman E, Gunnell D, Hazell P, Townsend E, van Heeringen K.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2016,2016.5.12,,,"Comment in Ugeskr Laeger. 2016 Nov 28;178(48):V68569. BACKGROUND: Self-harm (SH; intentional self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self-harm. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological therapy, in adults following SH. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to 29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy (CBT-based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive-behavioural, problem-solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion-regulation group-based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality.There was a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow-up in terms of fewer participants repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.26; k = 6; N = 594; GRADE: low quality).For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU: group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow-up (MD -18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95; k = 3; N = 292; GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE: low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT-oriented therapy was also associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow-up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However, neither DBT vs 'treatment by expert' (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k = 1; N = 97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k = 1; N =18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH.Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.10; k = 1; N = 136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k = 1; N = 391; GRADE: low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact-based interventions) (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k = 4; N = 3277; GRADE: very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k = 2; N = 1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner's letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; k = 3; N = 840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone-based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero cell counts; GRADE: low quality).None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of psychological therapy: interpersonal problem-solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home-based problem-solving therapy, long-term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment.We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: CBT-based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive."
